Inside: subtract \u2192 k=2, then i becomes 2. req is computed as i mod n (2 mod 5 = 2, so req becomes 2. Then, next loop iteration: The while condition checks (2 - 2 >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nInside: subtract \u2192 0, then i becomes3. new req: 3 mod5 is3 \u2192 req=3. Next loop check: 0 - req (3)>=0 \u2192 no \u2192 so loop exits. Hence the print k which is 0. So that works.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me see what the Java code is doing. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads two integers n and k. Then it has a loop where it subtracts req from k until k - req is less than zero. The variable req starts at 1 and increases each iteration. The index i starts at 1 and increments each time. Also, req is set to i mod n, but if that mod is zero, then req becomes n. At the end, it prints the remaining k.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to figure out when the loop stops by accumulating the required value each time and subtracting from k until you can't subtract the next req. Then output the leftover k.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran. Let me think about the structure here.\n\nIn Fortran, the main program doesn't have a class like Java. So the code will be a program block.\n\nFirst, I need to read n and k. In Fortran, we can use read(*,*) for that. \n\nVariables declarations. In Java, variables i, req are int. In Fortran, we just declare them as integers. So declare variables: integer :: n, k, i, req\n\nInitialize them. The Java code starts with i =1 and req=1, so the same in Fortran.\n\nThe loop structure is a while loop. Java uses a while loop, so in Fortran, you can use a do loop with a while clause. Wait, Fortran has do-while loops? Let me recall. Oh right, the do while is possible but sometimes a bit tricky. The syntax is:\n\ndo\n   ...\n   if (condition) exit\nend do\n\nAlternatively, you can structure the loop as a do-while.\n\nBut let me think. The loop condition is: While (k - req >=0) do steps. Wait, but in the original code, they subtract req from k only if it is >=0, else break. So the loop condition is while (k - req >=0 ), and inside the loop, subtract, then increment i, and set the new req.\n\nLet me see the code step by step.\n\nInside the while loop:\n\n1. Check if k - req >=0: if yes, subtract it from k, set k =k-req. (This is part of the loop condition check, but in the code the Java has an if statement again inside. Wait, looking again.\n\nWait the Java code does:\n\nwhile(k - req >=0) {\n\n   if (k - req >=0 ) { // why again? this seems redundant\n\n      k = ... \n\n   } else {\n\n      break;\n\n   }\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nWait, the code inside the while loop has an identical condition check, which seems redundant. Maybe it's a copy-paste error? Because the while condition is already checking that. However, maybe the code has some dependency that requires rechecking?\n\nWait perhaps the first check is necessary because the loop's while condition may have already passed, but if for some reason during the loop the value changed, maybe? Or in some cases, but in this particular code, the req might change before the condition is re-evaluated.\n\nWait the loop condition is checked at the start of each iteration. But inside the loop, the code first checks again (which is redundant) but maybe there's a scenario where req is changed before the next iteration? Not here, since the code flows as follows. Because the loop starts with the condition, subtracting req only if the condition holds. Because after starting the loop, the k - req can be still okay because nothing has changed yet. Wait, the code is written so that inside the loop, it checks again the same condition to decide whether to subtract the req.\n\nWait, this is redundant. Because in the loop's while clause (while (k - req >=0)), that condition is true when entering. So why the if block inside?\n\nAh, perhaps the code originally had a different logic. Wait maybe there's a mistake here? Since in Java, the loop's condition is checked at the start, and the code subtracts only if the condition is met. But since inside the loop, the condition was already true, the if is redundant. \n\nSo maybe that part is a mistake, but perhaps it's part of the code? Either way, I'll have to replicate the code as given. \n\nIn any case, let me parse the code again.\n\nThe loop is :\n\nwhile (k - req >=0 ) {\n\n   if (k - req >=0 ) {\n\n       k = k - req;\n\n   } else {\n\n      break;\n\n   }\n\n   i++;\n\n   ... set req based on i mod n ...\n\n}\n\nHmm, perhaps the second if-else is incorrect? But since the loop condition ensures that k - req is >=0 when entering, the else clause can never be executed here. So maybe that code is a mistake, and the actual logic is that even after the loop starts, somehow the condition changes before the subtraction, but I can't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code had some different variables, and this was a mistake, but since it's the given code, we have to translate it exactly as written.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is as written, so in Java:\n\nDuring each iteration:\n\n- The loop condition checks if k - req >=0, if yes, enters the loop.\n\nThen, inside:\n\nAgain, checks the same condition again (if (k - req >=0)), subtracts k. So that's redundant but not harmful.\n\nElse: break (even though condition was already true, so break is redundant.\n\nThen i increments, and the next req is set.\n\nSo the code is a bit redundant, but it's correct. But why is the inner check there?\n\nMaybe the original code had some other logic. But perhaps it's better to just translate it as it is.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop structure:\n\nthe loop in Java is:\n\nwhile (condition) {\n\n   ... check again the same condition? ...\n\n}\n\nHmm, translating the inner part:\n\nInside Fortran:\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndo while (k - req >= 0)\n\n   if (k - req >= 0) then\n\n       k = k - req\n\n   else\n\n       exit\n\n   endif\n\n   i = i +1\n\n   if (mod(i, n) /=0) then \n\n     req = mod(i, n)\n\n   else\n\n     req = n\n\n   endif\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the exit here would be redundant because of the loop condition. But like the Java code, perhaps the check is there again for some reason. Anyway, the user wants an exact translation.\n\nWait, the equivalent of Java's break would be exit.\n\nWait the inner code in Java's else block is break, which would break out of the loop. So if the inner condition (k - req >=0) is false, then the code breaks the loop, which is the same as exiting the loop here.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the code inside the do while loop:\n\nThe loop:\n\nInside:\n\nFirst check if(k - req >=0 ), if yes, subtract.\n\nElse, exit the do loop.\n\nThen, regardless of that, proceed to increment i and set the new req.\n\nWait no, the code is in Java:\n\nif (k - req >=0 ){\n\n   k = ... \n\n} else { break; }\n\nThen increment i and set new req.\n\nSo in the Java code's code, after subtracting, it proceeds to increment i and set req regardless of the else.\n\nWait, because if inside the else block the code executes a break, so the code in the else skips the rest of the loop body and stops.\n\nSo, in translation:\n\nin the inner if, the else case is to break, which causes to exit the loop.\n\nIn Fortran, the code would be:\n\nif (k - req <0 ) then \n\n   exit\n\nelse \n\n   k = k - req\n\nend if \n\nThen increment i.\n\nWait, perhaps better to structure the code so that after checking the condition again (as in the Java code's redundant manner?), proceeding accordingly.\n\nWait, what's the logic sequence:\n\nThe loop is entered because condition holds.\n\nThen, inside the loop's first step, it again checks the condition again. \n\nIf yes:\n\nproceed to subtract, then increment and compute req.\n\nIf no:\n\nbreak (exit the loop).\n\nWait, but the condition was already checked for loop entry, so in the first iteration, the condition must be true, so the else is not taken. \n\nAre there cases where, after entering the loop, the variable k or req is being modified before the check?\n\nAh, maybe req is not changed before this first check? Let me see the code again. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nInside the loop, the req is used again for threshold in the next iteration, but in the first check, the req hasn't changed until after the iteration.\n\nWait, the code inside the loop is:\n\nafter subtracting k, then i increments, then set req based on new i.\n\nAh right, so when you come into the loop, the current req is still the previous one.\n\nWait, the calculation of req is done after the k is subtracted and the i is increased. So in the first step of the loop, before the check (the redundant one), the req is still from before the loop's iteration, but the next iteration would check with a possibly new req? \n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps perhaps not. Because when the loop condition is checked again next time, the new req may have been set. So the code may change the req, hence the second check.\n\nWait perhaps the error in the original Java code is that the req for the next loop's condition is not yet computed. Let me see:\n\nLet's walk through an example.\n\nSuppose:\n\nInitial i=1, req=1.\n\nn is say 5, and k=3.\n\nFirst loop iteration: \n\nLoop condition checks (3 - 1 >=0 \u2192 true.)\n\nInside: subtract \u2192 k=2, then i becomes 2.\n\nreq is computed as i mod n (2 mod 5 = 2, so req becomes 2.\n\nThen, next loop iteration:\n\nThe while condition checks (2 - 2 >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nInside: subtract \u2192 0, then i becomes3.\n\nnew req: 3 mod5 is3 \u2192 req=3.\n\nNext loop check: 0 - req (3)>=0 \u2192 no \u2192 so loop exits.\n\nHence the print k which is 0.\n\nSo that works.\n\nBut if in the code, the req were not updated before the next iteration, then the condition would not be based on the new req. Wait but in the code as structured, the req is changed after the loop's actions, so the next loop condition uses the new req.\n\nYes, so the structure is okay.\n\nBut the code inside loops, in the code, the inner if statement is redundant, except to kop the break in case.\n\nAh, but perhaps the actual code is written in Java as:\n\nwhile (k - req >= 0) {\n\n   if (k - req >=0 ) { \n\n      subtract \n\n   } else {\n\n      break;\n\n   }\n\n   // do other things: i++, req... \n\n}\n\nWait, in this case, even if the condition was satisfied when entering, the inner check is still done, but in Java, if the entered loop, the condition is true, so the else case can't happen? Unless the variables change between the condition check and the inner if.\n\nBut in the code, the condition and the if are back to back. So unless between the while's check and the inner if, the code had been modifying variables. But here, there's nothing between the loop's entrance and the inside if. \n\nHence the if is redundant. Maybe the code originally had some other code there? Not sure. But the user asks to translate it as is.\n\nThus, the Fortran code would need to replicate that structure. \n\nNow, in Fortran:\n\nStart with program block:\n\nprogram codeforces_92_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k, i, req\n\n! Read inputs:\n\nread(*,*) n, k\n\ni=1\n\nreq=1\n\ndo \n\n    if (k - req <0 ) then \n\n        exit ; ! similar to break?\n\n    else \n\n        k = k - req \n\n    end if \n\n    i = i + 1 \n\n    if (mod(i, n) /=0) then \n\n        req = mod(i, n) \n\n    else \n\n        req = n \n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\nwrite(*,*) k \n\nend program \n\nWait, but the outer loop is an infinite loop here? Because it's a do loop without condition, so I have to use an exit inside the code. \n\nThe original code in Java is a while loop. So the Fortran version can use a do loop with the condition check inside, and break (exit) when needed. Alternatively, maybe rewrite as a do-while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to match the while structure. \n\nWait, perhaps better to structure as:\n\nAn infinite loop?\n\nWait the original loop can also be considered as:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   if (k - req <0 ) break;\n\n   else {\n\n      k = k - req \n\n   }\n\n   ... then i, req updates...\n\n}\n\nHence, the analogous structure is an infinite do loop with a break condition. \n\nWait, in the initial Fortran code I wrote above, it starts with do, and has exit once the condition is not met, else proceeds. That is correct.\n\nBecause the Java's loop condition is k - req >=0, and in each iteration, first check if the condition holds again. \n\nSo in the Fortran code:\n\ndo \n\n   if (k - req) <0 \u2192 exit. Else subtract.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo the do loop will run until that condition is met, then proceed.\n\nAfter exiting, we write the remaining k.\n\nThat looks right.\n\nNow testing for the example where n=5, k=3:\n\nInitially: i=1, req=1. \n\nFirst iteration of the DO..:\n\nCheck if 3-1 <0? No \u2192 else branch \u2192 subtract \u2192 k=2.\n\nThen increment i \u2192 2.\n\nThen compute req: mod(2,5)=2 \u2192 req=2.\n\nNext DO:\n\nCheck 2-2 \u2192 no, since 0 is not <0 \u2192 so subtract again \u2192 k=0.\n\ni becomes 3.\n\nreq: mod(3,5)=3.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nk (now 0) - req (3) is -3 <0 \u2192 exit loop. \n\nThus, finally print 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case: let me think if n=2 and k=3.\n\nInitial req=1. i=1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nk=3-1=2. i becomes 2. Then check mod(2, 2)=0 \u2192 req becomes n=2.\n\nNext loop:\n\nCheck 2 - req (2) \u2192 0. Not less than zero \u2192 subtract \u2192 k=0. i becomes 3. req is mod(3,2)=1.\n\nNow, next loop: check k(0) - req (1) \u2192 -1 <0 \u2192 exit. So output 0+1 = ?\n\nWait no, after k was subtracted to zero (from 2 to 0 when doing 2 minus 2. Then in the next iteration:\n\nk is 0, req is 1.\n\nThe loop would check first: 0-1 = -1 <0, so the if condition is met, so exit the loop, and therefore, the output is 0 + 1? Wait no: in that case, the current remaining value is 0. Let me step through.\n\nWait, step by step:\n\nSecond iteration (after first loop step):\n\nAfter i becomes 2, req is set to 2.\n\nThen in the next loop iteration:\n\nDoing:\n\nif (k - req < 0 \u2192 2 (the k at that point is 2 after first iteration is done?)\n\nWait the steps:\n\nWait initial k=3.\n\nFirst iteration's steps:\n\nFirst loop entry.\n\nCheck if (k - req (3-1=2 \u22650? no: no it's 2 is positive? Wait the code first does the exit check?\n\nWait in code as written in my Fortran:\n\nIn the first loop iteration (after initial state):\n\nThe initial state is:\n\ni=1, req=1, k=3.\n\nEnter do loop:\n\nCheck the if(k-req <0 \u2192 (3-1=2>=0 \u2192 so no. So else clause \u2192 subtract 1 from 3 \u2192 k=2.\n\nThen i becomes i+1 \u2192 2.\n\nThen, compute req: since mod(2, 2) =0 \u2192 so req becomes n which is 2. \n\nThen the loop: computes this, then goes back to the top of the do loop.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nNow, check if (k - req) \u2192 2 - 2=0 which is not less than 0 \u2192 so else \u2192 k=2-2 \u21920.\n\nThen i increments to 3.\n\ncompute req: mod(3,2)=1 \u2192 so req=1.\n\nThen go back to starting DO again.\n\nThird iteration:\n\nNow check if (0 -1 =-1) which is <0 \u2192 exit the loop. \n\nSo finally, k is 0, so the printed value is 0, correct?\n\nWait in this example, when k=3 and n=2, the correct answer would be 0?\n\nWait let me think what the algorithm does.\n\nThe problem is from Codeforces 92A, which requires calculating the remaining number of the k-th element after some operations. Let me see what the program does.\n\nWait the problem: from the problem link (codeforces 92A), probably the problem involves distributing eel slices. The program seems to be finding the kth one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original program is the solution and I should not worry about that, but perhaps the code is correct?\n\nWell, the user wants the code translated as given.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nSuppose k=1, n=1.\n\nThen, the initial values: i=1, req=1.\n\nLoop check for (1 -1) >=0 \u2192 yes?\n\nNo initial code. So in Fortran code:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nloop entry:\n\ncheck 1-1 (0) \u2192 not less than zero \u2192 else.\n\nset k =1-1 \u21920.\n\ni increases to 2.\n\nreq set to mod(2,1)=0, so since mod is zero, req becomes 1.\n\nLoop again:\n\nNow, k is zero.\n\nCheck k - req (0-1) \u2192-1 \u2192 which is less than zero \u2192 exit loop.\n\nThus, output zero.\n\nWait but let's see what the Java code would do.\n\nOriginal Java:\n\nn=1, k=1.\n\nInitial req=1, i=1.\n\nLoop:\n\nInside loop:\n\nthe while condition is (k - req = 0 \u2192 equal to zero \u22650 \u2192 true \u2192 enter loop.\n\nThen inside, subtract. k becomes zero.\n\ni increases to 2.\n\nthen req is computed since (i mod n 2%1 =0 \u2192 thus req =n which is 1.\n\nThen loop continues?\n\nWait the next loop iteration: while (0-1 >=0? No. \u2192 so loop does not execute.\n\nTherefore after the first iteration, the loop stops.\n\nWhich concludes same result as the Fortran code.\n\nSo the code seems okay.\n\nThus, the Fortran translation would be as I wrote, except maybe some syntax issues.\n\nWait variable mod: in Fortran, modulo(i,n) or mod(i,n). I used mod function, which in Fortran is mod(a,p). The mod function is available.\n\nThus the code structure is correct. \n\nWait checking the \"else\" in the second if statement. The first if after the i increment: \n\nAfter incrementing i to i+1, we check modulo(i,n). If not equal to zero \u2192 req=mod(i,n). Else req =n.\n\nThe code in the Fortran code correctly represents that.\n\nNow, variables.\n\nVariables in Fortran must be declared. I have:\n\ninteger :: n, k, i, req\n\nCorrect.\n\nThe read statement:\n\nread(*,*) n, k \n\nWhich reads the two numbers, correct.\n\nThen initializations i=1, req=1.\n\nYes.\n\nThe loop structure is a do, then after exit, we proceed to print.\n\nThe write(*,*) k.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nIs there any problem with the code's syntax?\n\nIn the first if statement:\n\nif (k - req <0 ) then \n\n   exit \n\nelse \n\n   k = k - req \n\nend if \n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen increment i.\n\nThen compute the new req.\n\nThus, this code is correct.\n\nTherefore I think this is the correct translation."
