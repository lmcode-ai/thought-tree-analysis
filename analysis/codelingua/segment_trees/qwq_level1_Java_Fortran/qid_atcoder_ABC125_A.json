Wait then the first i is 3, which is less than 3.5 \u2192 yes, add 5 \u2192 ans_num is 5. Then i becomes 6, which is greater than 3.5: so only one iteration. So ans is 5.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program reads three integers from the input: sec, per_num, and a third number which is converted to a double and added 0.5. Then it calculates how many times you can add 'sec' to the initial 'sec' value before reaching or exceeding 'max_sec'. Each iteration adds 'per_num' to the answer.\n\nWait, the loop is for (int i = sec; i < max_sec; i += sec). So the loop starts at 'sec', then adds 'sec' each time, checking if the new value is still less than max_sec. Each iteration increases ans_num by per_num.\n\nFirst step is to parse the input correctly in Fortran. The Java code uses Scanner, so in Fortran, we can read from standard input using read(*,*) statements.\n\nLooking at the variables:\n\n- sec is an integer\n- per_num is integer\n- max_sec is a double (since it's read as a double, then 0.5 is added). Wait in Java, the third input is read as an int, then cast to double and 0.5 added. So the third input is an integer N, then max_sec is N + 0.5. Wait, the Java code does:\n\ndouble max_sec = (double) sc.nextInt() + 0.5;\n\nSo the third input is an integer, but converted to a double, then add 0.5. So if the user enters, say, 5, then max_sec becomes 5.5.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, when reading the third variable, we can read it as an integer first, then compute the max_sec as that integer + 0.5d0 (double precision). \n\nNow variables in Fortran:\n\nsec: integer\nper_num: integer\nmax_sec: real*8 (double precision)\nans_num: integer\n\nThe loop in Java is for i starting at sec, increment by sec each time, while i < max_sec. So in Fortran, the loop would start at i=sec, then next i is i+sec, and so on. But in Fortran, do loops are a bit different. Maybe a do loop with a step? \n\nWait, the loop is like: \n\ni starts at sec, and increments by sec each step, but only as long as i < max_sec.\n\nSo the loop runs when i < max_sec. Each iteration, ans_num increases by per_num.\n\nSo for example, if sec=2 and max_sec=5.5, then the i's would be 2 (since 2 <5.5 \u2192 yes), then 4 (still yes), then 6 (6 <5.5? no). So total count would be 2 iterations. Each adds per_num per iteration.\n\nSo the number of iterations is floor((max_sec - sec)/sec) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the loop counts how many steps. Let me think:\n\nThe first iteration, i is sec. So check if sec < max_sec. If yes, then ans_num += per_num. Then add sec again: i becomes 2*sec. Check again, and so on. \n\nThe total number of iterations is the number of times you can add sec to the starting point (sec) before exceeding max_sec.\n\nWait, the starting i is sec. The first iteration includes i starting at sec. So the total iterations is floor((max_sec - sec)/sec) ?\n\nWait (max_sec - sec)/sec \u2192 subtract sec from max_sec and divide by step? \n\nLet me think with example: \n\nSuppose max_sec =5.5, sec=2. Starting i=2: yes (2 <5.5), so count 1. Then i becomes 4, which is still <5.5: count 2. Next i becomes 6, which is >5.5 \u2192 stop. So total 2 loops. (max_sec-2)/2 \u2192 (3.5)/2 is 1.75 \u2192 floor to 1 \u2192 but we have 2 iterations. Hmm so the formula is floor( (max_sec - start)/step ), but when start is the initial value. Wait, maybe we have to add 1 somewhere. \n\nWait the formula for the number of terms in arithmetic sequence up to N: first term a1, step d. The nth term a_n = a1 + (n-1)*d < N. So:\n\na1 + (n-1)*d < N \u2192 (n-1)*d < (N -a1) \u2192 n-1 < (N -a1)/d \u2192 n < (N -a1)/d +1 \u2192 floor( (N-a1)/d ) +1 ?\n\nWait if N is exactly at a point where a_k = a1 + (k-1)*d < N, then the count would be k. Hmm maybe a better way is to model the loop as the number of terms is floor( (max_sec - sec)/sec ) +0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to not try to compute it with formula and just loop as in the original code.\n\nSo in Fortran, how to implement the loop?\n\nWe can have a variable i starting at sec, and increment by sec each time. But in Fortran loops have fixed steps. Maybe need a do-while loop?\n\nAlternatively:\n\nDO ... but with a condition. \n\nAlternatively, a loop where i starts at sec, and in each iteration, check if i < max_sec. If yes, add to the count and increment i by sec. Repeat until i is no longer less than max_sec.\n\nWait in Fortran, variables are declared before use. So variables to declare:\n\ninteger :: sec, per_num, ans_num=0\n\nreal(8) :: max_sec \n\nWe can read the inputs as:\n\nread*, sec, per_num, temp_int\n\nThen max_sec = real(temp_int, kind=8) + 0.5d0\n\nWait, since in Java, the third input is sc.nextInt(), then converted to double and added 0.5. So in Fortran, read third as integer, then compute the max.\n\nWait:\n\nSo in Fortran code steps:\n\nRead three numbers: first and second as integers, third also as integer, then the third part is third +0.5 as a double.\n\nThen loop:\n\ni starts at sec. \n\nInitialize i = sec?\n\nYes. While (i < max_sec), ans_num += per_num, then i += sec.\n\nBut in Fortran, how to do a loop like that with increment steps not fixed?\n\nWe need to find an equivalent loop structure.\n\nMaybe a do while loop:\n\ni = sec\n\ndo while (i < max_sec )\n\n    ans_num = ans_num + per_num\n\n    i = i + sec\n\nend do\n\nYes, this should work. So the loop will run as long as i is still less than max_sec. Each iteration adds per_num to ans_num and updates i.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nRead sec, per_num, temp3 as integers. \n\nCompute max_sec = temp3 +0.5 (but in double precision).\n\nInitialize ans_num to 0\n\nInitialize i = sec (integer?)\n\nWait wait, but in Java, the loop variable i is integer, but max_sec is a double. So comparing i (integer) to max_sec (double) is okay?\n\nYes, since in each step, i is an integer, but the condition is if the integer value is less than the double max_sec. For example, if max_sec is 5.5, then 5 is less than that, but 6 would not be. \n\nIn Fortran, integers compared to real numbers: should be okay since Fortran would do implicit conversion.\n\nIn Fortran, that loop would work as i is an integer variable, but compared to a real variable. For example, when max_sec is 5.5, and i=5, then 5 < 5.5 \u2192 true. So that's correct.\n\nNow variables:\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nProgram atcoder_ABC125_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger:: sec, per_num, ans_num, temp3, i\n\nreal(kind=8) :: max_sec\n\nread*, sec, per_num, temp3\n\nmax_sec = dble(temp3) + 0.5d0\n\nans_num =0\n\ni = sec\n\ndo while (i < max_sec)\n\n    ans_num = ans_num + per_num\n\n    i = i + sec\n\nend do\n\nprint*, ans_num\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. The declarations are okay here.\n\nWait variables: temp3 is integer, needed to read third value. Then max_sec is double. The variable i is integer.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me check in the loop:\n\nIs i being incremented by sec each time? So starting at sec, then adding sec each time.\n\nYes, so this should work.\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nSuppose sec=2, per_num=3, temp3=5 \u2192 max_sec =5.5.\n\nLoop steps:\n\ni starts at 2 <5.5 \u2192 yes: ans becomes 3.\n\ni then becomes 4 \u2192 <5.5 yes, adds 3 again (total 6). \n\ni=6: 6 >=5.5 \u2192 exit loop. So total ans is 6.\n\nWhich is correct, because the first addition (2 and 4) are both <5.5. So 2 increments.\n\nAnother example: sec=3, per_num=5, temp3=3 \u2192 max_sec=3.5?\n\nWait then the first i is 3, which is less than 3.5 \u2192 yes, add 5 \u2192 ans_num is 5. Then i becomes 6, which is greater than 3.5: so only one iteration. So ans is 5.\n\nAnother test: sec=1, per_num=1, temp3=2 \u2192 max_sec 2.5. \n\nInitial i=1: add, i +=1=2 \u2192 still <2.5 \u2192 add again. Then next i is 3 \u2192 which is >2.5, so total two times, so ans is 2.\n\nWhich matches the loop steps: 1 and 2 are below 2.5, so two times. Correct.\n\nTherefore the code should work.\n\nNow for the code formatting in Fortran: \n\nMake sure all variables are declared, and the loop is correctly structured. Also, note that in Fortran, real constants like 0.5 should be written as 0.5d0 for double precision (kind=8).\n\nWait, in the code above, max_sec is declared as real(8), and set to dble(temp3) + 0.5d0, which is correct.\n\nThus, the translated code should be as above. Now, putting it into the correct syntax.\n\nAlso, note the program name is atcoder_ABC125_A.\n\nNow, writing the code step by step.\n\nFirst line:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc125_a\n\nimplicit none\n\nThen variables:\n\ninteger :: sec, per_num, ans_num, temp3, i\n\nreal(kind=8) :: max_sec\n\nThen read the inputs:\n\nread*, sec, per_num, temp3\n\nThen compute max_sec:\n\nmax_sec = real(temp3, kind=8) + 0.5d0 \n\nAlternatively, using dble(temp3):\n\nmax_sec = dble(temp3) + 0.5d0\n\nEither is okay. \n\nThen initialize variables:\n\nans_num =0\n\ni = sec\n\nThen the loop.\n\nThen print the result.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc125_a\n    implicit none\n    integer :: sec, per_num, ans_num = 0, temp3, i\n    real(8) :: max_sec\n\n    read(*,*) sec, per_num, temp3\n    max_sec = dble(temp3) + 0.5d0\n    i = sec\n\n    do while (i < max_sec)\n        ans_num = ans_num + per_num\n        i = i + sec\n    end do\n\n    print*, ans_num\nend program atcoder_abc125_a\n\nWait, in variable declarations, I can write:\n\ninteger :: sec, per_num, ans_num, temp3, i\n\nbut initializing ans_num to zero isn't necessary because it's set later. Wait in the code, after declaration, we set ans_num =0? Wait in the code above, initially set ans_num=0?\n\nWait in the code as I have written, in the declarations, the code is:\n\ninteger :: sec, per_num, ans_num =0, temp3, i \n\nBut in Fortran, you can give initial values in the declaration if you use a certain syntax, but not sure. Wait, in Fortran 90 and later, you can write:\n\ninteger :: ans_num =0 \n\nYes, that's allowed. Alternatively, in the code, the initial setting is needed. Let's check the code again. \n\nWait in the code written above, the variable ans_num is initialized to 0 in the declaration as part of the list.\n\nWait the line:\n\ninteger :: sec, per_num, ans_num = 0, temp3, i \n\nThis sets ans_num to 0 at declaration. But the other variables (sec, etc.) might not have their values set here, but will be read from input. That's okay, since they're read via the read statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe better to separate the initializations. Like:\n\ninteger :: sec, per_num, ans_num, temp3, i\n\nans_num =0\n\nBut regardless, the code should work.\n\nAlternatively, in the code as written, that's okay.\n\nAnother thing: when declaring variables, in Fortran you can list multiple variables with the same type.\n\nSo the code should be correct. Let me double-check for possible issues.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, when using real variables with integers, the comparison between integers and reals is allowed. For example, when i is an integer and max_sec is a real(8), then i < max_sec is okay.\n\nYes, because the integer will be implicitly converted to real for the comparison. \n\nYes. So, all seem okay.\n\nTesting with the example where the Java code would run:\n\nJava code has variables:\n\nsec=2, per_num=3, third input 5 (so max_sec=5.5). The loop runs for i=2,4 \u2192 2 times, so answer is 6. \n\nIn the Fortran code, it should compute the same.\n\nYes, the loop runs two times. So code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the translation is as above."
