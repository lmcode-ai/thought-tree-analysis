Wait for example: if m was 3 before increment, and the current j is 1, then j_ starts at 3. Then the loop condition 3>1 is true, so in first iteration:\n\nj_ =3:\n\nwe set aa[3] = aa[2]\n\nthen j_ becomes 2 (j_--). Then 2 >1 is true; set aa[2]=aa[1]\n\nthen j_ becomes 1. Now the condition is 1>1 is false. So loops 2 and 3 are processed (since 3 down to 2). Wait so it shifts the elements from positions j+1 up to current m (which was at m =3) by one position to the right. Because after the shift, when we then set aa[j] =a, it is now part of the array and pushes previous elements right. Wait the logic is to \"insert\" the current a value into position j of the aa array, making room by doing a shift. But the position to insert is j, moving existing elements from j onward to the right by one.",

So in first iteration, temp =0, m becomes 1.",

Wait perhaps the code here is equivalent to:\n\nint temp = m;\n\nm = m +1;\n\nthen the loop runs for j_ from temp downwards to j+1? Wait let's see. The for loop is:\n\nLoop initialization: the 'int j_ = m++', so the j_ variable gets m's current value, then m increments by 1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first I need to understand what the Java code is doing. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe code starts with a main method in a class called codeforces_67_B, which is a subclass of PrintWriter. The class has a Scanner to read input. The main function creates an instance of this class and calls its main() method. \n\nLooking at the main() method: It reads n and k from input, then an array bb of size n. Then initializes another array aa of the same size. Then there's a loop over a from n-1 down to 0. Inside that loop, there's a while loop where it checks aa[j] >= (a + k) and decrements bb[a]. Then some shifting in the aa array, followed by setting aa[j] = a. Finally, it prints the aa array elements +1, separated by spaces.\n\nWait, there are some points to note here. The loops and array manipulations need to be converted correctly into Fortran syntax. Also, in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but maybe the code here uses 0-based? Because the Java code uses 0-based arrays. Oh right, in Fortran if we declare an array with, say, dimension(n), indices start at 1, but maybe we need to adjust that or use offset. Hmm. Or perhaps handle it by adjusting indices.\n\nFirst step, figure out variables: \n\nJava variables:\n\n- n and k are integers read from input.\n\n- bb is the array of integers.\n\n- aa is another array as the output.\n\nThe main loop runs a from n-1 downto 0. In Fortran, this can be done with a do loop from a = n-1 downto 0, but in Fortran arrays, the indices might be tricky. Wait, the original Java initializes bb with size n, so the input array is size n entries, from 0 to n-1 inclusive.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are usually 1-based unless specified otherwise. Wait, to avoid confusion perhaps better to make all arrays 1-based in Fortran, so indexes from 1 to n. But then all the loops and variables can be adjusted with an offset. Or perhaps the code can be adjusted to force arrays to start at 0. Alternatively, adjust indices accordingly.\n\nHmm. Let's consider for example, in Java aa is initialized with size n. So in Fortran, I'll create an array aa of n elements with indices 1 to n. Then when code references aa[j], in Fortran it would be aa(j). \n\nBut looking at the loop variables in the Java code: in the first for loop:\n\nfor (int a = n -1; a >=0; a--):\n\nIn Java, 'a' goes from the last index down to 0. The equivalent in Fortran would be something like:\n\ndo a = n-1, 0, -1\n\nBut since Fortran doesn't allow variables in the loop's limits unless they are integer constants? Wait no, Fortran uses variables all the time. So for example, if n is an integer variable, then a loop from n-1 to 0 down.\n\nBut when we initialize the array 'bb' in Fortran, it's probably better to use 1-based. For example, read the first element into bb(1), then next into bb(2). But in Java, the first number after n and k is stored at bb[0]. So we need to handle that. Therefore, in code, suppose in fortran the input is stored in an array bb(1 to n), which corresponds to the Java's bb[0] to bb[n-1]. So the first element of bb in Java (bb[0]) corresponds to the Fortran's bb(1). So when the loops refer to bb[a], if Java uses a as the index starting at n-1 (so highest possible index is n-1, which in Fortran would correspond to bb(n)), but the loop starts from n-1 (Java's max index) going down, so in Fortran, the variable a is the same as in Java and refers to the same positions. Wait, perhaps this could be a problem. For example, in java's code, when 'a' is n-1, that's the last element of the array. So in Fortran's array with indices 1 to n, that would be bb(a+1). Wait, that seems convoluted. Alternatively, just make the Fortran array 0-based? Wait, in Fortran you can specify the starting index with the DIMENSION statement where the array is declared. So perhaps by declaring the arrays with lower bound 0?\n\nLike, do in the beginning:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: bb\n\nBut that's dynamic and requires an allocation, perhaps. Wait, in Fortran, arrays are static in length. So since the input 'n' is variable, we can't have declared array dimensions at compile time. Hmm, so this is going to be an issue. Wait, Fortran doesn't support variable length arrays at file scope? Wait, but I think in Fortran 90 or later you can use allocatable arrays, which is better. So variables n and k can be read first, then allocate arrays of the correct size.\n\nAh yes. So in Fortran, we can declare the arrays as allocatable. So let me outline the steps for translating the code.\n\nThe structure:\n\n- Read n and k from input.\n\n- Read an array of n integers (the 'bb' array).\n\n- Initialize an array 'aa' of size n (initialized to 0 or whatever).\n\n- Then run the same loop as in Java.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code:\n\nIn the loop for a from n-1 downto 0:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nint j=0;\n\nwhile (bb[a] > 0) {\n\n    if (aa[j] >= a + k) then decrement bb[a]\n\n    j++ \n\n}\n\nWait, so the 'j' loop increments until either the while loop's condition is false (i.e., when bb[a] reaches 0) or when j reaches the end? Let me see: the loop runs as long as bb[a] is positive, and in each iteration, check aa[j] (initially starting at 0) against a +k. If so, decrement and then j increments? Or wait the Java code's logic is:\n\nIn each step of the while (bb[a]>0), they check if aa[j] (current j location) is >= a +k, then subtract from bb[a], then increment j, regardless. Because whether the condition was true or not, j is incremented.\n\nWait the code's steps are:\n\nInitialize j to 0.\n\nLoop while bb[a] >0:\n\n   if (aa[j] >= a +k )\n\n       then decrease bb[a] by 1\n\n   then j increases by 1.\n\nWait that\u2019s not correct. The way it's written, the condition for decrement is if the aa[j] position (the current j?) is >= (a +k). And that, even if the if statement does not execute, we still increment j, but only after the check. So the while loop continues as long as bb[a] is still >0. The 'j' keeps increasing until maybe it goes beyond the array's length, but then there might be undefined behavior. But maybe the problem constraints prevent that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'j' can loop beyond the size of the array, but maybe the problem conditions ensure that that doesn't happen. Hmm. Need to preserve that logic in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, the array aa is initialized. Let's see in code:\n\nThe first problem is the variables:\n\nJava code:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\n\nint k= sc.nextInt();\n\nint[] bb= new int[n];\n\nfor ( int i=0; i <n; i++) bb[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen for aa, declared as int[n], initialized to 0. \n\nSo in Fortran, similar approach but with allocatable arrays.\n\nSo translating to Fortran:\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ninteger :: n, k\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: bb, aa\n\n...\n\nRead n, k:\n\nread(*,*) n, k\n\nallocate ( bb(n) )\n\nread(*,*)(bb(i), i=1,n)\n\nallocate ( aa(n) )\n\nThen the main loop:\n\ndo a = n, 1, -1 (Wait wait, wait, original code in Java loops 'a' from n-1 downto 0 (i.e., starting at n-1, which is the last index of the array). \n\nWait in Java the array bb has indices from 0 to n-1, and the loop in a goes from a = n-1 down to 0.\n\nIn Fortran, since the bb array is 1-based (bb(1) to bb(n)), so the equivalent of 'a' is the index in Java (starting at 0) 0 to n-1.\n\nWait so the 'a' variable in Java is from n-1 (max Java index) down to 0 (min), so the same as Fortran for the array indices from the last element to first. So in Fortran, the loop variable would correspond as follows:\n\nJava's a corresponds to (Fortran's index of bb(a) is (a+1). Or no, actually, in Java's code, the value is at bb[a], and in Fortran, since we have 1-based, the equivalent is bb(a+1). Wait but maybe not. Let me see:\n\nWait no, perhaps the Fortran array's indices are 1-based but the loop indices can be handled as per the problem. \n\nWait to prevent confusion, perhaps in Fortran, we will use an array bb(0:n-1). That way the indices match exactly Java's arrays. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make the loop variables in Fortran the same as in Java. Let me see:\n\nSuppose in Fortran, the array bb is given indices starting at 0. Since Fortran is 1-based by default, to do that, we can declare:\n\ninteger, dimension(0: n-1) :: bb\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't allocate a dynamic array with such indexing unless using a deferred shape. Wait perhaps in Fortran 90, it's easier to declare allocations with specific lower bounds. For example:\n\nallocate( bb(0:n-1) )\n\nBecause when allocating, you can specify the lower and upper limits. So that can be done.\n\nThus, the first step:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nThen allocate bb(0:n-1):\n\nyes.\n\nSimilarly for aa.\n\nSo:\n\nread(*, *) n, k\n\nallocate( bb(0:n-1) )\n\nread( *, * ) (bb(i), i=0, n-1 )\n\nWait but the input is multiple integers on the same line? Or Scala's Scanner is reading numbers one per input? Actually the code reads the array via sc.nextInt() in a loop until n numbers are read. So in Fortran, to read n integers for the bb array (0..n-1):\n\nread( *, * ) (bb(i), i=0, n-1 )\n\nassuming that the input is the same: all in a single line, separated by spaces, or however the input is given, but the Java code allows that. So probably, this is okay.\n\nTherefore, arrays bb and aa can be declared with indices 0 to n-1, so the indices map directly to Java's.\n\nThat way, code can be easier, since the subscripted variables will be the same as Java.\n\nHmm, good. So this way, the variables aa(j), j from 0 to n-1.\n\nThen, in the next for loop:\n\nJava:\n\nfor (int a = n-1; a >=0; a -- )\n\nIn Fortran, that's:\n\ndo a_ind = n-1, 0, -1\n\n  ... \n\nBut the variable name can be the same 'a' in Fortran.\n\nWait variable names: in Java variables are int a, here in loop a. In Fortran, variables must be declared, but inside loops the index vars can be declared with a, but need to be declared as integers.\n\nSo in the program, variables 'a' and 'j' can be declared as integers in a subroutine or at the beginning of the program.\n\nNow, the loop inside:\n\nInside the a loop:\n\nInitialize j =0.\n\nThen a while loop:\n\nwhile ( bb(a) > 0 )\n\nIn Java, the loop runs while that is true; each iteration, if (aa[j] >= a +k ), then decrement bb[a], then j increments by 1.\n\nBut in code:\n\nWait the code does:\n\nthen:\n\nbb[a] was initially the value from input, so for each a, this part is part of the loop.\n\nWait the code's inner loop is:\n\nwhile ( bb[a] >0 )\n\n   if (aa[j] >= a +k )\n\n       bb[a] -=1\n\n   j +=1\n\nSo each loop iteration:\n\nThe while condition is first checked, then, inside the loop:\n\nCheck if aa[j] is greater or equal to (a +k). If so, decrease bb[a] by 1.\n\nThen increment j.\n\nWait the 'bb[a]' can be reduced, which eventually may cause the while loop to exit.\n\nThe loop continues while bb[a] >0, so once bb[a] reaches 0, the loop exits.\n\nIn Fortran, while loops can be coded with a do-loop with an exit condition, but perhaps using a do-while structure (or simulate it with a do loop with a condition check at the top, etc.)\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThe loop can be:\n\ndo while ( bb(a) >0 )\n\n   if ( aa(j) >= (a +k) ) then\n\n       bb(a) = bb(a) -1\n\n   end if\n\n   j = j +1\n\nloop_scalar: do ... but perhaps in Fortran we can write:\n\ndo while (bb(a) >0)\n\nWait, but the increment of j will happen even if the if isn't triggered.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nYes, in Java code:\n\n whether or not the 'if' clause was executed, j is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration.\n\nSo implementing that in Fortran is straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem comes that when j reaches the size of the array, then in Java 'aa[j]' could be out of bounds, but perhaps in the problem's constraints, it's guaranteed not to happen.\n\nTherefore, we can assume that j will not exceed array's indices (as per problem's constraints). So in code:\n\nNow, after the while loop, the code does:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--)\n\n   aa[j_] = aa[j _ -1]\n\nWait in Java code:\n\nAh this code is a bit tricky. Let me look again.\n\nThe code after the 'while' loop (inside the 'a' loop):\n\n   for (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_-- )\n\n   aa[j_] = aa[j_ -1 ]\n\n   aa[ j ] = a\n\nOriginally, m is 0.\n\nWait in Java code the 'm' variable is a field of the class. The code:\n\nInitially, m is 0.\n\nThen, in the loop over a (from n-1 downto 0):\n\nInside each iteration:\n\nAfter the while loop on bb[a] >0, the code has:\n\nfor (j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--; )\n\nThis line's syntax is interesting because m is incremented. Let's parse that.\n\nThe for loop:\n\nInitialization is 'int j_ = m++ ', so:\n\nInitially, 'm' is 0 (since declared as int m=0; in the class).\n\nWait let me see the Java code:\n\nThe code is in the main() method inside the class, so the int m is declared as a local variable in that function.\n\nWait original code's main() method:\n\nvoid main() {\n\n    int n = sc.nextInt();\n\n    int k = sc.nextInt();\n\n    int[] bb = new int[n];\n\n    for (int i =0; i <n; i++ ) bb[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\n    int[] aa = new int[n]; // declared and initialized to zero?\n\n    // Java initializes arrays to 0, so all aa elements are 0.\n\n    int m =0;\n\n    for (int a =n-1; a >=0; a-- ) {\n\n        int j =0;\n\n        while (bb[a] >0 ) {\n\n            if(aa[j] >= a +k ) bb[a] -=1;\n\n            j++;\n\n        }\n\n        // Now after the while loop.\n\n        for( int j_=m++; j_>j ; j_-- ):\n\n            aa[j_] = aa[j_ -1];\n\n        // Then:\n\n        aa[j] = a;\n\nWait, let me explain the for loop variables:\n\nThe first part: j_= m++;\n\nThe code in the for initialization is j_ = m++, so m gets incremented after. So, initial value is the current m (the value before increment), then m becomes m+1. So, the loop variable is set to m (the old value before the increment), and m increases by 1.\n\nThe loop then runs as long as j_ > j. The loop's step is j_--.\n\nThe loop's body: copying aa[j_-1] into aa[j_]\n\nThis is a left shift? Or moving elements of aa to the right to create space for inserting something at position j?\n\nWait:\n\nSuppose, after the while loop, the variable 'j' holds  the current j (the one after exiting the while loop). The loop here is for j_ starting at m (initial m value, which was the previous m before increment). Then j_ is decremented, but the loop condition is j_>j.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me take an example:\n\nSuppose before this for loop:\n\nm is current value (e.g., 3).\n\nThen j_ is set to m (3) and m becomes 4 after.\n\nThe loop will start with j_ =3.\n\nThen, the loop continues as long as j_ > j.\n\nSuppose j is 5, then since 3>5 is false, the loop won't run.\n\nWait maybe the example, maybe better to think of code behavior.\n\nWait originally, aa is an array of size n, initially set to zero (since Java initializes with 0). \n\nWait, sorry, in the Java code:\n\nint[] aa = new int[n];\n\nSo all elements are 0 to start with.\n\nSo, in the code, m starts at 0. For each iteration of the outer loop (the 'a' loop), we first have the while loop, then the for loop which is used to shift some elements in aa.\n\nWait the purpose of this for loop and the increment of m?\n\nHmm. The main idea of the code is to represent some kind of greedy algorithm, perhaps placing the current 'a' in the array 'aa' at the position where it's valid.\n\nLet me think through the code logic. \n\nSuppose that in the outer loop over a (reverse order), for each a starting from the end (highest index, n-1), and working backward.\n\nThe code wants to do something such that when placing 'a' (the current index from the end) into array 'aa', but the array needs to have certain constraints.\n\nThe 'bb[a]' is some number indicating how many others before it can be placed. \n\nMaybe the problem is from Codeforces question B for problem 67, so perhaps the problem is about arranging some students or something with certain constraints, but since I don't have the problem statement, I can only rely on code logic.\n\nIn any case, I need to translate the code.\n\nLooking at the loop:\n\nAfter the while loop, which modifies bb[a] and finds a j position, then the code shifts elements in the aa array from m down to j+1, to make space for the current a at position j.\n\nWait the 'for( j_= m++, ... ) ':\n\nThe code is:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--)\n\nBecause the for loop has the initialization j_ = m++ which is m's initial value then increments m.\n\nOnce the for loop finishes, m gets incremented.\n\nWait, the loop essentially is taking the current m (the starting m) as j_ starts at that, and then increments m to m+1 by the pre-increment. \n\nWait perhaps the code here is equivalent to:\n\nint temp = m;\n\nm = m +1;\n\nthen the loop runs for j_ from temp downwards to j+1? Wait let's see.\n\nThe for loop is:\n\nLoop initialization: the 'int j_ = m++', so the j_ variable gets m's current value, then m increments by 1.\n\nThen, the loop continues while j_ > j.\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe loop will start at starting j_ = old m (before increment).\n\nLoop runs as long as current j_ > j.\n\nEach iteration, subtract 1 from j_, then check again.\n\nInside the loop, for each j_ step, we copy the previous element to the current, like: copy the value from aa[j_-1], moving to aa[j_].\n\nThe end result is that from the current m to position j + 1, the elements are shifted to the right. \n\nWait for example: if m was 3 before increment, and the current j is 1, then j_ starts at 3.\n\nThen the loop condition 3>1 is true, so in first iteration:\n\nj_ =3:\n\nwe set aa[3] = aa[2]\n\nthen j_ becomes 2 (j_--).\n\nThen 2 >1 is true; set aa[2]=aa[1]\n\nthen j_ becomes 1. Now the condition is 1>1 is false. So loops 2 and 3 are processed (since 3 down to 2).\n\nWait so it shifts the elements from positions j+1 up to current m (which was at m =3) by one position to the right. Because after the shift, when we then set aa[j] =a, it is now part of the array and pushes previous elements right.\n\nWait the logic is to \"insert\" the current a value into position j of the aa array, making room by doing a shift.\n\nBut the position to insert is j, moving existing elements from j onward to the right by one. By shifting from m-1 down to j.\n\nWait more precisely:\n\nSuppose before this loop, we have m represents the current \"length\" of the array in aa? Because before each a in the loop, m starts as the current length, then after shifting and inserting, the new length is m+1?\n\nHmm, since in the for loop's start: the temp is m ( the previous m ), then m is incremented by 1 at the end.\n\nWait the first part of the loop (the for loop's initiation and the increment of m) seems crucial. Because temp is m, and m becomes m+1.\n\nThen the for loop loops from j_=temp downto j+1?\n\nWait the loop will run as long as j_ >j. So j_ needs to be larger than j. So for each step:\n\nThe elements at positions (j_ -1) are copied to position j_.\n\nAfter the loop, we write aa[j] =a. \n\nThis effectively shifts the section starting at j up to (temp-1) right by one, then inserting a at position j, with the new length being temp+1? (since m was temp, then becomes temp+1)\n\nWait maybe it's easier to think of:\n\nThe variables m is the current length of the array. The code is always appending new elements to the end. Wait perhaps the array 'aa' in Java is acting as a list? Since it's an array. Not exactly. It depends on the use of m.\n\nWait the code starts with m =0.\n\nIn the first iteration of 'a' (the highest possible a, n-1), \n\nNow, after processing the while loop (which may modify bb[a] and find a suitable j), they then do the shift, then insert a at j. \n\nThe loop for j_=m (original m, initially 0) and m is increased by 1. So in first iteration, temp =0, m becomes 1. The loop condition is 0> j. \n\nInitially j is determined from the while loop. Suppose that after the while loop, j is some value, say, 3. Then in this case, the j_ loop would not run (0>3? No, but if j was 0, then 0>0 is false; etc).\n\nWait let's assume in the first step, the j has some value (call it j_val). The shift is moving elements from m up to j_val positions. \n\nWait perhaps the code uses 'm' as the length of the 'aa' array so far, so that when you want to insert into position 'j', you shift the elements from m to the back down to the proper indices. Wait maybe the current 'm' is the number of elements in the array. \n\nWait m is initialized to 0, which would mean that the current length is zero. Then each insertion increases m by 1, so that the maximum element used in aa is up to m-1. \n\nSo for example, inserting position j, the current m is m_prev, after insertion, the new m is m_prev+1, and the positions from m_prev down to j are shifted right, inserting a at position j.\n\nWait that could be the case. The code:\n\nThe for loop creates a loop for j_ from m (the initial m, before increment) down to (j+1):\n\nWait the loop runs as long as j_ >j. So the starting value is old m (before increment), so for each step, j_ starts at m_initial, and the iterations are until j_ =j+1.\n\nTherefore the elements from aa[ m_initial -1 ] down to aa[j] are shifted. \n\nThen inserting the value a at position j.\n\nWait yes, because when we have:\n\nfor (j_=m_initial; j_>j; j_-- ) \n\n=> \n\nj_ runs from m_initial to j+1, stepping down by one each time.\n\nThus:\n\nIn each iteration of the loop:\n\naa[j_] = aa[j_-1]\n\nThat's moving the value from j_-1 to j_. So for all those positions between j and m_initial (the original m), this effectively shifts the segment from j to m_initial -1  right by one position, opening up a space at position j to put a. \n\nAh! So basically, the entire block does:\n\nInsert 'a' at position j in the array, thereby increasing the length by 1. The 'm' was the previous length, and after this insertion, it becomes m+1.\n\nWait 'm' is supposed to be the length, yes. So inserting into a position before index m would require making space.\n\nThus, the code is building up the array from left to right (in terms of the values of 'a', which are processed from the last index n-1 down to 0) and inserting each 'a' at position j, which is determined in the while loop.\n\nThe logic is similar to an insertion sort-like process, where each new element is placed at a particular position, and existing elements after the position are shifted to the right by one.\n\nHmm, so in Fortran, how would this code look?\n\nFirst, in the code before the for loops:\n\nvariables:\n\ninteger :: a, j, jj, m\n\nRead n and k, etc. allocations...\n\nInitially, m is set to 0.\n\nThen, the outer loop: do a from n-1 down to 0.\n\nInside the outer loop:\n\n    j = 0\n\n    while BB(a) >0: \n\n        (process)\n\n    implicit in Fortran that would have to be a do loop:\n\n        do while (bb(a) >0 )\n\n            if (aa(j) >= (a +k) ) then\n\n                bb(a) = bb(a) -1 \n\n            end if\n\n            j = j +1 \n\n        end do \n\nWait, but in the Java code, the incrementing of j is first after checking the condition, so it's the same here.\n\nWait in Fortran, the code is same here.\n\nThen, the next loop: \n\nWe have to do the shifting loop, but in Fortran. \n\nFirst, the code in Java:\n\nfor( int j_=m++; j_>j; j_-- ) {\n\n    aa[j_] = aa[j_ -1 ]\n\n}\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nint temp_m = m \n\nm = m +1 \n\nthen, loop from jj = temp_m downto j+1, step -1:\n\nthen for each jj in that range:\n\naa[jj] = aa[jj-1 ]\n\nso in Fortran:\n\n! Before the loop:\n\ntemp_m = m \n\nm = m +1 \n\n! Then loop jj from temp_m downto j+1 \n\ndo jj = temp_m, j+1, -1 \n\n    aa(jj) = aa( jj-1 )\n\nenddo \n\nWait yes.\n\nWait the code in the Java's for loop is:\n\nLoop initialization:\n\nint j_ = m++; // which is equivalent to:\n\nj_ is set to the value of m before incrementing m by 1.\n\nSo the temporary m value is stored in j_, then m +=1.\n\nThen, the for loop runs while j_ >j \n\nWhich is equivalent to the jj loop between jj = temp_m downto (j+1).\n\nBecause the condition is j_ >j is true when jj is greater than j. So jj starts at temp_m, and goes down to j+1.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can code that part as:\n\n temp_m = m\n\nm = m + 1\n\ndo jj = temp_m, j+1, -1\n\n   aa(jj) = aa(jj-1)\n\nend do \n\nThen, we set aa(j) = a \n\nThus, that is the code's equivalent in Fortran.\n\nNow, the array aa is to be filled with the elements.\n\nWait in fortran, the arrays bb and aa are both 0-based. So aa(0), aa(1), ... aa(n-1) can be used.\n\nNow, initializations:\n\nInitially, the aa array is allocated to size n, and in Fortran, allocated arrays have elements initialized to 0 (if integer) only if you set them explicitly? Wait no, in Fortran, when you allocate an array, it's uninitialized unless given an initial value. Oh right! Wait that's an issue. Because in Java, initializing aa as new int[n] sets all elements to zero.\n\nIn Fortran, when you allocate(aa(0:n-1)), the elements are not initialized. So we have to explicitly set them to zero. \n\nTherefore, after initialization of aa, we have to initialize all elements to 0.\n\nThus, after the allocate:\n\nwrite(*,*) 'ALLOCATE bb and aa'\n\nallocate( bb(0:n-1 ) )\n\nallocate( aa(0:n-1 ) )\n\ndo i = 0, n-1 \n\n  aa(i) =0 \n\nend do \n\nSimilarly for bb, because the code requires that the initializations of 'aa' to zero as per Java. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the 'aa' array starts with all elements zero, because it's initialized with an all-zero array. So that's a key point. The Fortran code must set all aa elements to zero at the start.\n\nNow, handling the rest. \n\nAfter all loops, we have to print the elements of aa, each of them plus 1. Because in Java, it's printing aa[i]+1. \n\nThe print loop in Java:\n\nfor( i from 0 < n ):\n\n   print( aa[i]+1, space )\n\nthen println()\n\nIn Fortran, a typical way might be to print each entry with a space, then move to next line. \n\nFortran's write statement can handle this.\n\nThus, after processing, the code to output would be:\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n   write(*, '(i0,1x)', advance='no') aa(i)+1 \n\nend do \n\nthen to avoid trailing space, maybe tricky, but the problem might allow trailing space. Alternatively, use a loop formatting with trailing space but a carriage return.\n\nAlternatively, writing all but last with a space, then the last one without, but perhaps it's easier just to allow a trailing space. \n\nAlternatively, using a comma separated list, but that might not be better.\n\nAlternatively, building a string with all numbers plus 1, separated by spaces, then write it.\n\nAlternatively, just follow exactly the Java code's output methods: after printing, \\n.\n\nThe Java code uses PrintWriter.print() to print each term with a space, then println().\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nThe code can write the numbers with a format that outputs them separated by spaces. \n\nA possible format is: write(*, \"(1000i0,1x)\" / trouble because the number of terms can vary. Alternatively, use a loop with commas and fixed width, but flexible.\n\nAlternatively, using a format like (\":/\", (i0,1x)) or similar. Let me think.\n\nSuppose, here is code:\n\nwrite(*, *) ( (aa(i) +1), i=0, n-1 )\n\nBut the default print would put spaces between them, which would be okay. However, each number is preceded by a space (maybe not exactly the same as code, but perhaps same effect is expected? Or in the code's output, numbers are printed with a trailing space, and a line break.\n\nAlternatively, to have each number followed by a space except the last, it can be written with a format that uses commas, but it's a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, code:\n\ndo i =0, n-2\n\n   write(*, '(i0,a)', advance='no') aa(i)+1, ' '\n\nend do\n\nwrite(*, '(i0)') aa(n-1)\n\nThen finally new line via the last write.\n\nAlternatively, but perhaps via a format statement like:\n\nwrite(*, '(1000i0,1x)') (aa(i)+1, i=0,n-1)\n\nBut then the final space will be there, but maybe acceptable.\n\nThe problem may not care about the trailing space, given that in code submission platforms trailing space is often permitted in output.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed.\n\nPutting it all together, the Fortran program would be as follows:\n\nProgram codeforces_67b\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, k, a, j, jj, m, temp_m \n\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: bb, aa \n\n  ! Read input:\n\n  read(*, *) n, k \n\n  allocate( bb(0:n-1) )\n\n  allocate( aa(0:n-1) )\n\n  ! Initialize aa to zeros:\n\n  do a =0, n-1 \n\n    aa(a) =0 \n\n  end do \n\n  read(*, *) ( bb(a), a=0, n-1 )\n\n  m =0 ! holds the length of 'aa' so far \n\n  \n\n  do a =n-1, 0, -1 \n\n    j =0 \n\n    do while ( bb(a) >0 ) \n\n      if (aa(j) >= a +k ) then \n\n        bb(a) = bb(a) -1 \n\n      end if \n\n      j = j +1 \n\n    end do \n\n    temp_m =m \n\n    m = m +1 \n\n    do jj=temp_m, j +1, -1 \n\n      aa(jj) =aa(jj -1) \n\n    end do \n\n    aa(j) =a \n\n  end do \n\n  ! Output:\n\n  write(*, '(1000i0,1x)') ( aa(i)+1, i=0, n-1 )\n\n  ! Wait, but the above adds an extra space at the end.\n\n  ! To avoid that, perhaps:\n\n  write(*, '( (i0,1x), / )' ) (aa(i)+1, i=0, n-1 )\n\n  ! The above format will autospace between each number, then new line.\n\n  ! Alternatively:\n\n  ! The following uses a loop for each element except last:\n\n  do a=0, n-2 \n\n    write(*, '(i0,1x)', advance='no') aa(a)+1 \n\n  end do \n\n  write(*, '(i0)') aa(n-1)+1 \n\n  \n\nend program\n\nWait, but the last part's code in Java is for (int i =0; i <n; i++) print (aa[i]+1 +\" \"); then a println. So each element is printed with a space after, including the last. So the Fortran can just use a format with a trailing space, which may produce an extra space but that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, use the format \"(*i0,1x,a)\" but perhaps best to test. Since in programming contest problems, trailing space is typically acceptable, the first version would be okay.\n\nWait, but in the code the output statement:\n\nThe code:\n\nwrite(*, '(1000i0,1x)') (aa(i)+1, i=0, n-1 )\n\nThis writes each of the numbers separated by nothing (the first format is 1000i0 which is each in no space, then after them all a space (the 1x. So actually, the space is only once at the end. \n\nThat would lead to: numbers like 1 2 3 4 followed by a space at end.\n\nBut perhaps the problem allows that.\n\nAlternatively, to use the comma inside the expression to separate them with spaces, but with the trailing space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best is:\n\n write(*, '(1000( i0, 1x ))') ( aa(i)+1, i=0, n-1 )\n\nBut that would put a space after each. The same as the code's original print with a space at end. Which is OK.\n\nWait, in the generated code:\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPrint all elements with a space between, then suppress the space at the end via edtp kvmvq\n\nWait maybe simply writing:\n\n write(*, *) ( aa(a)+1, a 0, n-1 )\n\nThe * Edit des dynamically writes each element, separated by blanks. The problem is that this would have padding which might not matter, since the problem expects spaces between numbers, but perhaps any such spacing is acceptable. So if the numbers are separated by one or more spaces, it's okay.\n\nThus, perhaps:\n\nwrite(*, *) (aa(a)+1, a =0,n-1 )\n\nBut then when written with a format *, the numbers are printed with blank separation, so no trailing space. Wait, no, the format * will write each number separated by blanks, but the last one has no following space. \n\nWait for example, if there are three elements, the format* would print them like '5 6 7' with space between them but none at the end. Because in the format * the default writes each item separated by a space, with no trailing space. \n\nThus that's exactly what the problem expects. So in the Java code, the loop  prints \"aa[i]+1 + \" \" each time, which results in having a space after each number, including the last. \n\nHence the discrepancy between Fortran's format * and the Java's code's output has the last number with a space after. \n\nHmm. To duplicate exactly the Java's output, meaning trailing space, perhaps it's necessary to have an extra space at the end.\n\nThus perhaps better to use the first approach, and just write with a trailing space.\n\nAlternatively, code:\n\n do a =0, n-1 \n\n    write(*, '(i0,a)', advance='no' ) aa(a)+1, ' ' \n\n  end do \n\n write(*, '(a)') ''\n\n This would print each element plus a space, and then a newline. \n\nAlternatively, that loop would result in adding a space after the last element, which matches Java's code.\n\nAlternatively, using an explicit write with space:\n\n write(*, '(1000i0)') ( (aa(a)+1), a =0, n-1 ), 1\n\nWait no, would add an extra number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps best is the loop:\n\n do a =0, n-1 \n\n    print *, aa(a)+1 ; but without the new line between the numbers. \n\nWait Fortran print statement is easier.\n\nAlternatively:\n\ncharacter(len=4000) :: output\n\ninteger :: i \n\noutput = ''\n\n do i =0, n-1 \n\n    write( output, '(i0,1x)', advance='no') aa(i)+1 \n\nend do \n\nwrite(*, *) trim( output )\n\nBut constructing a string and trimming is tricky. Alternatively, just go with the loop:\n\n do a =0, n-1 \n\n   ! using list directed \n\n   write(*, '(i0, 1x)', advance='no') aa(a)+1 \n\n end do \n\n write(*,*) \n\nThe advance= 'no' keeps the pointer on the same line, then after each a, the \",1x\" adds a space. The final blank after the last number remains. Then the following write(*,*) adds a new line. This would perfectly match Java's output.\n\nYes, that's the way to go.\n\nThus, the final print statements would be:\n\n do a =0, n-1\n\n    write(*, '(i0, 1x)', advance='no') aa(a)+1\n\n end do\n\n write(*, *)\n\nThus, each element is output followed by a space (including the last), and then the newline.\n\nOkay, putting it all together, here's the Fortran code."
