Wait in the original problem (probably similar to the AtCoder problem C from ABC165), the constraints on n and m may be small enough that their product is manageable. Since the code is using DFS with backtracking to generate all non-decreasing sequences of length n with elements up to m, but even for n=20 and m=50, that's combinations like (m+n choose n), which can be really big. But as a programmer, I'll proceed under the assumption that the problem constraints allow this method.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. \n\nThe main class is for a problem probably from AtCoder, like problem C of ABC165. The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) to generate all possible sequences of numbers from 1 to m of length n, and calculates the maximum score based on some conditions given by the q queries.\n\nThe variables a, b, c, d are arrays of length q. The n, m, q are input integers. The main method reads the inputs, then calls a DFS function. The DFS function builds a list (like an ArrayList in Java) where each element is an integer between 1 and m, with the condition that the numbers are non-decreasing. Each time the list reaches size n, it calculates the score by checking for each query if the difference between the b[i]th and a[i]th elements is equal to c[i], adding the d[i] if so. The maximum score is stored in the static variable ans.\n\nHmm, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about how to handle the dynamic list from the DFS. In Java, they used an ArrayList which grows as needed. But in Fortran, arrays are static. However, since the size needed is up to n elements (since it's building a list of size n), we can use a fixed-size array of size n, and track the current length. So instead of an ArrayList, maybe use an array 'list' of size n, and a variable 'current_length' to track how much is filled.\n\nThe DFS is recursive. So the function will need to pass along the current position or length. Let me sketch how the DFS would work in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- a, b, c, d should be arrays of integers with size q.\n- n, m, q are integers.\n- ans is a long integer (so Fortran integer(8) perhaps).\n\nThe main program will read inputs. Then call dfs with initial parameters.\n\nThe Java's list.size() is replaced by the current length, which starts at 0. The list is represented as an array with indices from 1 to n (Fortran uses 1-based or 0-based? The original uses 1-based indices? Let me see:\n\nIn the Java code, a[i] is taken as input and subtracted by 1, so the list uses 0-based indices. Wait no, the a[i] and b[i] are stored as subtracted by 1, because Java uses 0-based.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so when accessing list elements in the score calculation, need to adjust the indices. So for each query, the a[i] and b[i] in Java were stored as 0-based, but in Fortran's array which is 1-based, perhaps we can store a, b as 1-based indices. Wait let me check.\n\nOriginal Java code for the score calculation:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {\n    score += (list.get(b[i]) - list.get(a[i]) == c[i]) ? d[i] : 0L;\n}\n\nIn Java, list uses 0-based indexing. The a[i] is given as input, subtracted by 1. So if the input is 1 for a given a[i], it becomes 0, which is the first element. So theJava code's a[i], b[i] are 0-based indices.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so when we store a, b, etc. maybe we can just read them subtracted by 1, but then in the array, that would be their 0-based equivalent. But maybe it's easier to store a and b as 1-based, so when the user inputs, say, 1, it remains as 1.\n\nWait, in the input, let me see:\n\nIn Java:\n\na[i] = sc.nextInt()-1;\n\nSo the input for a[i] (original) is 1-based, subtracting 1 to make it 0-based.\n\nIn Fortran, since the list indices are 1-based, perhaps the a and b arrays can store the original 1-based indices, so no need for subtraction. Because in the score calculation, when:\n\nlist(b[i]) - list(a[i]) == c[i]\n\nIn Fortran's array, list is 1-based, so the a[i] and b[i] stored in the array can be the original 1-based input. So that would match: when the user inputs a value of 1, then in Java's a it's stored as 0. But in Fortran, if stored as 1 (so not subtracting), so when the code runs, the difference will be the same. Because the difference is list[b] - list[a], so the indices would be the same (since the original a and b are the same as per the problem's input regardless of 0/1-based indexes). \n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the variables here. Let me think:\n\nSuppose in the problem, the queries are like: for a given i, the a[i] and b[i] are indices between 1 and n, such that b[i] > a[i], and check if list's b[i]th element minus list's a[i]th equals c[i]. \n\nIn the original Java code, since their list is 0-based, they subtract the input a and b by 1. So if a user inputs a number 2 as starting point, that becomes 1 as the index in their list. So in Fortran, since we can make the list 1-based, then the a and b stored will be the same as the user input. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, instead of subtracting the input a and b from 1, I can store their original values. \n\nSo that's a first point to note in variables.\n\nNext, the variables:\n\nJava has those static arrays and variables. In Fortran, these would be global variables, perhaps in the main program or module. Since Fortran is free from object-oriented, but modules allow that. Alternatively, since the code is small, we can have everything in a single (main) program.\n\nThe variables a, b, c, d arrays of q elements each. Since q can be up to what? Not sure, but assuming that we'll have to read its value first.\n\nVariables n, m, q as integers. The ans is a Fortran integer with kind=8 (since in Java it's a long, which is 64-bit). \n\nNow, the DFS function.\n\nIn Java, the list is an ArrayList. The DFS is implemented with backtracking. The recursion passes the current list, and in each step, adds a number to the list, then removes it after returning.\n\nIn Fortran, we need to represent this list as an array, and track its current length. Since the maximum length is n, the list can be an array of size n, and have a variable 'current_length' which starts at 0, and goes up to n. \n\nThe logic in DFS: the function must be recursive. Since Fortran allows recursive functions, we can define it as a recursive subroutine.\n\nThe base case is when current_length == n. Then we can loop through the queries to compute the score.\n\nOtherwise, for the current step, the next number to add must be >= the previous number, to ensure non-decreasing sequence, but wait\u2014 wait looking at the Java code: the logic in the for loops. \n\nLooking at the Java's code's dfs method:\n\nif the list is not empty, then the next number must be >= the last element of the list. For example:\n\nif (!list.isEmpty()) { \n   for (int num = list.get(list.size()-1); num <= m; num++) {\n      add to list, recurse, remove\n   }\n} else {\n   for num from 1 to m:\n      add, recurse, remove\n}\n\nThus, the list is built in non-decreasing order. Each step selects a number which is not smaller than the last one. \n\nSo to translate this into the fortran version's loop:\n\nIn the fortran's DFS, the current_length is the current size. So the sequence is represented in the array up to current_length elements. \n\nThus, when adding the next element (current_length+1):\n\nif current_length is zero, start from 1, and can go up to any up to m. But no: in the Java code's else branch, they loop from 1 to m. So that's okay.\n\nWait in else case (current_length is 0), the loop is for num from 1 to m. Then when adding, it will proceed, then backtracking.\n\nIf current_length >0, then the next number must be at least the last element in the array (i.e., the current_length-th element). So the loop variable starts at list(current_length). \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, perhaps the DFS can be written as a recursive subroutine that tracks the current_length and the array up to that. \n\nThe array can be a global array of size n. So, when the DFS is called, it appends next elements to the array, up to n elements.\n\nTherefore, here's the plan for variables in Fortran:\n\nDeclare a global list array of size n: integer :: list(n). \n\nVariables a(q), b(q), c(q), d(q).\n\nThe variables n, m, q as integers. The answer is ans, a 64-bit integer (integer*8).\n\nThe main program will read n, m, q first. Then the arrays a, b, c, d. \n\nWait order of inputs: in Java's main, after reading n, m, q, then reads q lines, each with 4 numbers. So for each i from 0 to q-1:\n\na[i] = sc.nextInt() - 1; \n\nBut in Fortran, for a's and b's, if we don't subtract 1, then as per earlier discussion, if the sequence in the list is 1-based, then when reading, should read a and b as input values (original 1-based) and store directly.\n\nWait in Java, the user would have input the a's and b's as numbers from 1 to n (assuming, as problem requires). So in Java, the indices are stored as (input -1) (to have 0-based index into the array). \n\nIn Fortran, the list is 1-based, so the a's and b's can be stored as per input (the input is 1-based for their indices). Therefore, in the Fortran code, when reading a's and b's, we can read them directly, without adding or subtracting 1. Because in the code, the difference list(b) - list(a) (since list starts at 1) would be exactly the same as in Java's 0-based.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, variables a, b can be stored as the input numbers.\n\nThus, steps:\n\nIn Main:\n\n1. Read n, m, q from standard input.\n\n2. Allocate arrays a, b, c, d each of length q.\n\n3. Read q times: for each i from 1 to q (Fortran loops go 1-based):\n\n   read a(i), b(i), c(i), d(i)\n\n4. Initialize the answer as -100 (since in Java, it's set to -10L; but wait original Java code initializes to -100, because initial ans is -100L? Wait:\n\nLooking at the Java code, the static long ans = -100L;. So it starts at -100. Because the problem might require that even an empty score can contribute if the conditions are met, but maybe the maximum is only achievable starting from that.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to make ans a kind=8 integer with initial value -100.\n\n5. Then call the DFS function with initial length 0. Or, perhaps a recursive routine that starts with length=0.\n\nWait how to structure the DFS.\n\nPerhaps:\n\nThe recursive subroutine can take as parameter the current_length and the list array. However, in Fortran, arrays are always passed as pointers (unless explicit arguments?), but the subroutine can modify the array, but since the array is global, perhaps we can just use the global list array. \n\nWait in Fortran, if using a global list array of size n, which we keep updating, then the subroutine can access it directly. Since each recursive call must branch, changing the list and backtracking.\n\nAlternatively, the DFS function can take the current_length as an argument, and the next position to fill, but that's more complicated. Let me think as code structure.\n\nThe main program calls the DFS with current_length=0. The list is initially empty (since current_length is 0, so the first step is to add elements starting at 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the DFS is written as a subroutine, and here's how it might work:\n\nThe main part would call:\n\n   call dfs(0)\n\nThe DFS subroutine takes current_length (integer) as a parameter.\n\nThe code for DFS:\n\nrecursive subroutine dfs(current_length)\n\n  implicit none\n  integer, intent(in) :: current_length\n  integer :: num\n  integer :: i, local_length\n  integer*8 :: score\n\n  local_length = current_length \n\n  if (local_length == n) then\n    ! compute score\n    score = 0\n    do i = 1, q\n      if ( list(b(i)) - list(a(i)) == c(i) ) then\n        score = score + d(i)\n      endif\n    enddo\n    if (score > ans) then\n      ans = score\n    endif\n    return\n  endif\n\n  if (local_length == 0) then\n    do num = 1, m \n      list(1) = num\n      call dfs( local_length + 1 )\n    enddo\n  else\n    do num = list(local_length), m \n      list( local_length + 1 ) = num\n      call dfs( local_length +1 )\n    enddo\n  endif\nend subroutine dfs\n\nWait but list is a global array of size n. \n\nHowever, when adding elements, for the non-empty case, the starting number is the previous element. \n\nWait also, in the for loops:\n\nOriginal Java code for the list not empty (i.e., current_length is at least 1):\n\nthe for loop starts at num = list.get(...)\n\nIn Fortran, if we're at current_length steps (since list is filled up to current_length), then the next number must be from list(current_length) to m. \n\nWait in the code:\n\nthe previous element is list(current_length), so next element can be from that value to m. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code for the loop when not first step is:\n\n    do num = list(current_length), m\n        list(current_length +1 )= num\n        call dfs( current_length +1 )\n    enddo\n\nThen backtracking after returning. Wait, but in the original code, when adding an element (like in Java's list.add(num)), the code then proceeds, then removes it. \n\nHowever, in this Fortran approach, after returning from the recursive call, we need to undo the list modification, or else it'll carry over incorrectly. \n\nAh there's the crucial difference! \n\nIn Java, each time you add an element and then backtrack (by removing), but in this Fortran's approach, the array is global. So when choosing different branches, the routine will overwrite the list entries. So the backtracking needs to be done manually.\n\nWait in the current approach above, when you place list(current_length +1) = num, then call dfs, which proceeds adding into higher positions. But after returning, the next iteration of the loop would overwrite that with next num, but what about the higher positions? \n\nAh, no. Let me think:\n\nThe recursive function modifies the list(current_length +1) each time and proceeds. For example:\n\nFirst, the first call is current_length =0.\n\nThe for loop (for num from 1 to m).\n\nInside the loop:\n\nPlace num in list(1), call dfs(1).\n\nInside dfs(1), the current_length is now 1.\n\nNow, in the next tier, the code may loop from list(1) to m.\n\nSo in each recursive call, the next indexes are filled. \n\nWhen returning from the call to dfs(current_length+1), after the return, the next iteration of the for_loop comes back and - when done with that num, the code goes to the next num in the loop, and does the same. However, when we leave the recursion, the value of list(current_length +1) is still set to the old value. Wait that's wrong.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe first time:\n\nlist(1) is assigned to num=1, then call dfs(1). \n\nInside that dfs(1) call, it might proceed to list(2)=1, etc. When the deeper stack returns, the code proceeds beyond the call, and before moving to next num (like 2), list(1) has been set to 1. However, after returning from the first call to dfs(1), the code proceeds to the next num in the outer for loop (2), assigns that, etc. \n\nWait but in the outer loop, between iterations of num, after returning from the recursion, the code continues in the loop. Since list is a global array, when we leave the inner call, any changes to list beyond the first position are overwritten. \n\nWait no, the deeper recursive calls alter beyond the current_length.\n\nWait when we are at the outer loop:\n\ncurrent_length=0, in dfs(0). So in the loop:\n\nfor each num in 1 to m:\n\n   assign list(1) = num\n\n   call dfs(1)\n\nNow, in the call to dfs(1), which has current_length=1.\n\nNow, inside dfs(1):\n\nthe for loop (since current_length=1 is not zero, then the loop starts at list(1) (which is 'num' from the outer loop.\n\nIn that dfs(1) function, it's going to set list(2) to 'num2', then call dfs(2), etc.\n\nAfter the call to dfs(1) returns, we have to restore the previous value of list(1) ?\n\nWait no, that's the problem here. Because when the recursive call returns, the value of list(2) could be some value, but in the outer level's loop, the next num would overwrite list(1).\n\nWait actually, no because list is a global array. Let me walk through a step.\n\nSuppose in the first step of the loop (current_length=0):\n\nnum=1:\n\nlist(1)=1\n\ncall dfs(1). \n\nInside dfs(1):\n\nsince current_length =1, which is not zero. \n\nSo we run the code where the loop starts at num = list(1) (which is 1), and iterate from 1 to m. \n\nSuppose m is say 3.\n\nThen in the loop, for num=1:\n\nlist(2)=1\n\ncall dfs(2)\n\nDFS(2) proceeds to check if it's n. If n were say 2, then it would compute the score and backtrack.\n\nOnce returning from dfs(2), the list(2)=1 is still there, then the next iteration of the inner loop in dfs(1) will have num=2: set list(2)=2, call dfs(2).\n\nBut when returning, the code would have to reset list(2) back to original (1?), but no, because the list(2) was modified during the recursion. \n\nWait, this is an issue! \n\nBecause the list is a single array, and when backtracking, it is not cleared. So for example, after setting list(1)=1 and list(2)=1 (in the first step), \n\nthen when returning to the level of current_length=1 (inside the call from current_length=0), and proceeding to the next iteration of the loop for num=1, no, the next loop step is num=2 (within dfs(1) function):\n\nWait the outermost loop runs for num from 1 to m (for current_length=0). However when in the outermost call (dfs(0)), when after the first dfs(1) call (with list(1)=1) returns, the next iteration of the loop is for num=2: \n\nthe code sets list(1) to 2, and then calls dfs(1). \n\nThus, even with list(2) being something set in previous recursion steps, this is not an issue because the current_length is now increasing. The prior values of the list are only in the higher indices, but in the outer level, the current_length is 0, so the code is overwriting list(1). \n\nWait perhaps the recursion naturally handles this via the stack. \n\nWait, the list is a single array. When in the recursion, each level modifies the array. But once the recursion returns, the variables revert? No, because arrays are stored in memory. \n\nWait the problem is that after the first call to dfs(1) returns (where list(1)=1, and list(2) may have been set and then cleared?), but no, because in that call to dfs(1), the deeper calls modify list(2) etc., but after returning from dfs(2), those higher indices are not set back to their original values. \n\nWait in this code's current structure, when a deeper step returns, the variables beyond the current_length are not popped-off automatically. \n\nFor example, if after setting list[2] to some value in dfs(1), and then after returning from the dfs(1+something), when the loop in dfs(1) continues, any further changes to list[2] would overwrite, but when moving on, we need to undo those changes before the next iteration?\n\nWait no, actually, in the recursion layers, each step of deeper calls have a higher current_length. \n\nWait let's think of the sequence:\n\nSuppose n=2, so the first step is called as dfs(0).\n\nWithin that, in the loop (current_length=0):\n\nloop over num=1 to m.\n\nFirst iteration: num=1:\n\nlist(1)=1\n\ncall dfs(1).\n\nIn dfs(1):\n\ncurrent_length=1 so not zero. The loop will start from list(1)=1 to m.\n\nFirst iteration of that loop: \n\nnum=1:\n\nlist(2)=1. \n\nCall dfs(2). \n\nAt dfs(2):\n\ncurrent_length=2 is equal to n.\n\nCompute the score. \n\nAfter returning, control goes back to dfs(1)'s loop, next iteration on num=2.\n\nSet list(2)=2.\n\nCall dfs(2). \n\nHere, list(2) is 2. \n\nAfter returning from that, num=3 (if m=3), etc. \n\nThen when all loops in dfs(1) are done, returns to dfs(0), and then num loops in dfs(0) continues to next.\n\nAh, but in this case, the problem is that after the return from dfs(2) back to dfs(1), the value of list(2) remains as set in that step. However, that doesn't matter because in the next num iteration of the loop in current_length=1's loop, the value of list(2) is being overwritten again. Because the code runs:\n\nnum = ... \n\nso list(2) = num, which would replace the previous value of 1 or whatever.\n\nWait yes! \n\nSo in the steps of the loop in current_length=1:\n\nfor each num in 1..m (starting at list(current_length)=list(1)=1).\n\nEach iteration sets list(2)=num, proceeds to dfs(2), which may modify list(3) onwards, but that's not needed here for the case of n=2.\n\nWait in the above example with n=2, after entering dfs(2):\n\nthe current_length is 2. After processing (computing score), it returns to the previous loop.\n\nOnce that call to dfs(2) returns, then the loop in current_length=1's loop continues. The next step would be for next num value (next iteration of the for-loop), so in the next iteration, when the loop variable 'num' (the loop is the variable in the next step) increments, then list(2) is assigned to that num (then back to the first step).\n\nSo the variable list(2) is properly reset via each iteration of the loop in the current dfs frame. \n\nTherefore, the approach is correct because when a step sets list(current_length +1) to a value, then calls dfs, and upon return, proceeds to the next iteration, which will overwrite that value again. \n\nHence, no backtracking is needed because each step in the for-loop revisits the same slot, setting it anew. The code doesn't need to backtrack the array, because the loops themselves overwrite each slot each time. \n\nWait but what about variables beyond the current_length's scope?\n\nAh, for instance, if the current_length is 0, then when we loop over list[1], and go deeper into 2 and more, when backtracking, the higher indices (like list[2]) might still have values left. But since in the upper levels, the current_length is lower, the higher indices are beyond the current scope. \n\nHowever, when leaving the dfs(current_length) with, say, current_length =2, and then returning to a previous current_length=1, then those higher list entries may have left-over data, but since in the next iteration, current_length is 1, and the next assignment to current_length +1 (position 2) will fill it again, it shouldn't matter. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, to code this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, need to declare the variables as global variables. Since all variables (a, b, c, d, etc) are needed in the recursive subroutine, so placing them in the main program. \n\nWait in Fortran, the variables declared inside the main program can be accessed by the subroutines, as long as they are declared in the scope. \n\nWait the following program structure (pseudocode):\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, q\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b, c, d\n   integer :: list(1000)  ! assuming maximum n is manageable\n   integer(kind=8) :: ans = -100_8\n\n   ! Read inputs\n\n   read(*,*) n, m, q\n\n   allocate( a(q), b(q), c(q), d(q) )\n\n   integer :: i\n\n   do i=1, q\n      read(*,*) a(i), b(i), c(i), d(i)\n   enddo\n\n   ! Initialize list array (doesn't matter, since starts from 0)\n   call dfs(0)\n\n   write(*,*) ans\n\nend program main\n\nrecursive subroutine dfs(current_length)\n   integer, intent(in) :: current_length\n   ! variables accessed from main program: list, a, b, c, d, q, n, ans.\n   integer :: num, i\n   integer(kind=8) :: score\n\n   if (current_length == n) then  ! compute score\n      score = 0\n      do i = 1, q\n         if ( list(b(i)) - list(a(i)) == c(i) ) then\n            score = score + d(i)\n         endif\n      enddo\n\n      if ( score > ans ) then\n         ans = score\n      endif\n      return\n   endif\n\n   if ( current_length == 0 ) then\n      do num = 1, m\n         list(1) = num\n         call dfs(current_length + 1)\n      enddo\n   else\n      do num = list(current_length), m\n         list(current_length + 1) = num\n         call dfs(current_length +1 )\n      enddo\n   endif\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the subroutine can access the variables declared in the main program as long as they are in the same scope. Since the variables are declared in the same file/program, but in Fortran, that requires explicit interfaces or 'common' blocks, but if the variables are in the main program, maybe the subroutine can see them. Wait.\n\nWait in Fortran, the variables declared in the main program are in the main program's scope, and are accessible to the subroutines only if they are explicitly declared in the arguments or have common blocks, or are in the same module. Alternatively, if we list variables as \"implicit\" external access.\n\nAlternatively, to make this work, perhaps we need to define the list, a, b, c, d, q, n, m and ans in the main program, and in the subroutine dfs, declare them as using the main program's variables via \"use\" or through implicit sharing via use of variables in the filename's scope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have to make all the variables module variables, but this might get complex.\n\nAlternatively, move the subroutine inside the main program.\n\nAnother approach: make all variables as explicit arguments. But that's messy.\n\nAlternatively, use save attributes or common blocks.\n\nHmm, a better approach perhaps: \n\nUse a module to hold the global variables, which are visible to the main program and the recursive subroutine.\n\nLet me draft the code using modules.\n\nModule:\n\nmodule constants\n\n   use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : int1 => INT32, int8 => INT64\n\ncontains\n\n   recursive subroutine dfs(current_length)\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: current_length\n\n      integer :: num, i\n      integer(int8) :: score\n\n      ... (same as before)\n\n   end subroutine dfs\n\nend module constants\n\nThen, in the main program, we can declare the variables inside the main program, and access them via the module. Wait but that may not solve it.\n\nAlternatively, use a data block:\n\nCreating a common block where the variables are stored, so that the subroutine can access them.\n\nAlternatively, the easiest way for a small code is to use implicit sharing. But in Fortran, variables are local to the program unless declared as dummy arguments.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to pass all dependencies as arguments or through the recursion.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use recursive functions with dummy arguments, but I need to pass all the necessary arrays and variables each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving the list to be a parameter in the arguments, but that may be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, if all the variables (like a,b,c,d, ...) are in the same file, the subroutine can see them. Let me see.\n\nIn Fortran 90, a main program can have variables that are accessible by its subroutines in the same source file, provided that the subroutines are internal or defined in a module.\n\nAlternatively, making the subroutine internal to the main program.\n\nAh, yes! If we define the subroutine inside the main program, then it can access the main program's variables. \n\nYes, that's the way to do it.\n\nSo here's the revised plan:\n\nThe main program will declare the list array, a, b, c, d arrays, etc., and the recursive subroutine will be an internal subroutine within the main program.\n\nThus, all variables declared in the main program are accessible without parameters.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\nprogram main\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, q\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b, c, d\n   integer, dimension(100000) :: list ! assuming n is at most 1e5 etc. Need to adjust size based on problem's constraints. Wait but in Java code, n is read, but in Fortran need to allocate?\n\nWait, but earlier in this code sketch, I used list(100000), which may be insufficient if n can be large (though probably n is up to say 20 or something if the problem requires generating sequences via backtracking.)\n\nWait in the original problem (probably similar to the AtCoder problem C from ABC165), the constraints on n and m may be small enough that their product is manageable. Since the code is using DFS with backtracking to generate all non-decreasing sequences of length n with elements up to m, but even for n=20 and m=50, that's combinations like (m+n choose n), which can be really big. But as a programmer, I'll proceed under the assumption that the problem constraints allow this method. Hence, the java's code must have dealt with it, so this would have to be handled, but perhaps n and m are small.\n\nIn any case, for the purposes of coding, the list array needs to be dimensioned as n, but n can be up to, say, 20? Or better, dynamically allocated. \n\nWait here's the challenge: in the main program, the value of 'n' is read first, then we can allocate the list array as n elements. Because when the user enters 'n', we can determine the size. \n\nAh yes. Let me adjust the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, q, i\n   integer, allocatable :: a(:), b(:), c(:), d(:)\n   integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n   integer(kind=8) :: ans = -100_8\n\n   read(*,*) n, m, q\n\n   allocate( a(q), b(q), c(q), d(q), list(n) )\n\n   do i=1, q\n      read(*,*) a(i), b(i), c(i), d(i)\n   enddo\n\n   call dfs(0)\n\n   print *, ans\n\n   deallocate( a, b, c, d, list )\n\ncontains\n   recursive subroutine dfs(current_length)\n      integer, intent(in) :: current_length\n      use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: int8 => INT64\n      integer :: num, i\n      integer(kind=int8) :: score\n\n      if (current_length == n) then\n         score = 0_int8\n         do i=1, q\n            if ( list(b(i)) - list(a(i)) == c(i) ) then\n               score = score + d(i)\n            end if\n         end do\n         ans = max(ans, score)\n         return\n      end if\n\n      if (current_length == 0) then\n         do num = 1, m\n            list(1) = num\n            call dfs(current_length + 1)\n         end do\n      else\n         do num = list(current_length), m\n            list(current_length + 1) = num\n            call dfs(current_length +1)\n         end do\n      end if\n   end subroutine dfs\nend program main\n\nWait, but in this code:\n\n1. The list is an array of integer, allocated to size n. Because the maximum needed is size n.\n\n2. The subroutine dfs is inside the contains clause, so it can see the variables like list, a, b, c, d, etc. declared in the main program. \n\n3. The variables (a,b,c,d,list, ans, n,m,q are accessed without parameters.\n\n4. In the dfs, when current_length reaches n (the size of list), then the list is full (indices 1..n).\n\nThe variables are allocated before the subroutine is called. This should work.\n\nWait also: in the score calculation, the loop is over all 1-based indexes of a and b, hence the \"list(b(i)) - list(a(i)) \" will correctly compute the difference between the elements.\n\nAdditionally, in the code, the max function is used: ans = max(ans, score). But in Fortran, the max of two integers. But ans is kind=8 (int8). The variables: score is the same kind as ans.\n\nWait in the code, variables:\n\nIn the main program, ans is declared as integer(kind=8).\n\nIn the subroutine, score is declared as integer of kind KIND=int8 (which is the same as the kind already used for ans?\n\nWait in the use statement, maybe iso_fortran_env's int64 is called int64. Let me correct that:\n\nThe code should have:\n\nmodule iso (excerpt):\n\n  integer, parameter :: int8 = selected_int_kind(18)  (but using the module's types)\n\nWait in the above code, the line:\n\ninteger(kind=int8) uses the import from iso_fortran_env?\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nAlternatively:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, q, i\n   integer, allocatable :: a(:), b(:), c(:), d(:)\n   integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n   integer(kind=8) ::  ans = -100_8\n\n   read(*,*) n, m, q\n\n   allocate(a(q), b(q), c(q), d(q), list(n))\n   do i=1, q\n      read *, a(i), b(i), c(i), d(i)\n   enddo\n\n   call dfs(0)\n\n   print *, ans\n\n   contains\n      recursive subroutine dfs(current_length)\n         integer, intent(in) :: current_length\n         integer :: num, j   ! j is loop index (original i is used in main loop)\n\n         if (current_length == n) then\n            integer(kind=8) :: score\n            score = 0\n            do j = 1, q\n               if (list(b(j)) - list(a(j)) == c(j)) then\n                  score = score + d(j)\n               end if\n            end do\n            if (score > ans) then\n               ans = score\n            end if\n            return\n         end if\n         \n         if (current_length==0) then\n            do num = 1, m\n               list(1) = num\n               call dfs(current_length+1)\n            enddo\n         else\n            do num = list(current_length), m\n               list(current_length+1) = num\n               call dfs(current_length+1)\n            enddo\n         end if\n      end subroutine dfs\nend program main\n\nWait that may be better. Because in the dfs subroutine:\n\nInside the if (current_length ==n) block, defining and using 'score' as variable. Loop variable here is renamed as 'j' (since in the main has 'i') but actually in the subroutine 'i' is unused, but better to use j to avoid confusion if needed.\n\nAlso, in the score assignment, the comparison is between list(b(j)) - list(a(j)) == c(j).\n\nOkay, that's okay.\n\nWait for the data reading: the variables are stored in 1-based arrays. So the input's a and b are stored as the user inputs (1-based indices), so the code should work.\n\nTesting:\n\nSuppose n=2, m=2, q=1:\n\nQueries: 1 2 1 100 (meaning a=1, b=2, c=1, d=100.\n\nThe possible sequences are [1,1], [1,2], [2,2]\n\nWe check the differences between b and a (elements 2 and 1):\n\nFor [1,1], diff is 0, not matching c=1. Score 0.\n\n[1,2] gives 1. So adds 100. \n\n[2,2] also difference 0, score 0. \n\nThus the max is 100, so ans should be 100. The code should compute that.\n\nThus the code would correctly compute that.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nThe code's logic for building the sequences is correct?\n\nNow, the only other thing to check is whether the array allocations are correct.\n\n list is allocated as size(n) - so when it is filled up to current_length, list(1) to list(n) can hold all elements. In the recursive step, when current_length is 0, we set list(1), then for current_length=1, etc. \n\nNow, for the initial reading of a,b,c,d.\n\nThe variables a, b are stored as integers, not subtracted by 1. So when the user enters a value like 1 for a, it's stored in a(j), which refers to list(1) in the code.\n\nSo the indices are correct.\n\nThus, this should work.\n\nThe edge case where m is 1:\n\nAll elements are 1. The difference will be zero between any a and b, so only those queries where c is zero will give points. \n\nOther cases.\n\nNow, implementing that.\n\nAdditional Fortran-specific considerations:\n\n- The read statements may need to be formatted. In Java, inputs are read with \"nextInt()\", meaning that the inputs are space-separated. The Fortran code uses read *, which expects free format, separated by blanks, which should be compatible.\n\n- The initial answer is set to -100 (long in Java). In Fortran, that is integer(kind=8), initialized to -100_8.\n\n- The arrays a,b,c,d are integers (kind=4?), but in Fortran, integers are 4 bytes unless specified otherwise. Since the problem's queries can have up to what? d's could have large values, like up to 1e9? The problem's constraints need to be considered. But the code uses integers for a,b,c,d which should be fine, as d is an integer stored in d(i) as per the Java code (Java was storing d[i] as int).\n\n- The list elements are integers, up to m, which could be up to 1e5 (if possible), but since it's stored as integers (default kind), that's okay.\n\nFinal note: the fortran lists are 1-based, thus the loops can work correctly.\n\nThus, the above code should correspond correctly to the Java code provided. I think that's the correct translation."
