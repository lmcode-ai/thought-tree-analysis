Thus in the function, the first element of tmp is already the smallest value. Thus in Fortran, when processing tmp, we can:\n\nCompute min_val is first element.

So any changes made to 'a' (the list elements) are directly modifying the original A, hence after the function returns, because the return is 'a' (the same object as A), so in the function's case, this line is redundant; but the problem is that the function is intended to return the modified list, but since it's done in place, returning it is okay, but perhaps the code's flow is okay?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first. The problem is probably from AtCoder, which is competitive programming, so efficiency and handling edge cases is important.\n\nHmm, the main function here reads a list of integers. The problem seems to involve processing the array by repeatedly taking the remainder of elements with the smallest non-zero value, maybe reducing the elements until only one remains. The code uses an ArrayList, which in Java is dynamic. \n\nFirst step is to understand what the function 'func' does. Let me read through it again. The 'func' takes an ArrayList A, creates a new list (a) from it, initializes a min variable. Then it loops through each element in 'a'. If an element is zero, it removes it and adjusts the index. Else, for non-zero elements, it checks if 'min' is already set. If it is (non-zero), then it does a.get(i) mod min, and stores that in the array. Also, if any mod result is 1, it exits immediately, printing 1. Hmm, interesting. If min is zero, then they set min to that element. Then it sorts the array before returning.\n\nWait, the loop in 'func' might be tricky. Let me see: \n\nThe function goes through each element. For each element in a (which is a copy of A?), it first checks if the element is 0: remove and decrement index.\n\nOtherwise, if min is already set (non-zero), then the current element is replaced by mod with min. But if the mod is 1, then the program exits immediately (since if mod is 1, the GCD would eventually be 1? Maybe that's a shortcut). \n\nOtherwise, the first element sets min as its own value. Wait, but the code after processing all elements then sorts the array again, so the min is initially zero, and the first non-zero element would set min. But perhaps the purpose here is to find the minimum non-zero element? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function aims to reduce an array to a smaller array of remainders modulo the current minimum (but the current min may be updated during processing). Not sure exactly, but need to translate it to Fortran.\n\nSo translating to Fortran:\n\nFortran is a procedural language. It uses integers, arrays, functions, but needs explicit array sizes, etc. Since in Java you have dynamic lists, maybe in Fortran I can use pointers or arrays with dynamic allocation? Well, in old Fortran versions (77) you can't do a lot of that, but user asked for translating, so probably using Fortran 90/95/2003 syntax?\n\nSo in the Java code, the original code reads n, and then inputs n integers. Then sorts them. Then a block for all zero case. The main loop repeatedly calls func until a.size is 1, then outputs the ans.\n\nBut in Fortran, handling dynamic arrays can be done with allocatable arrays. So in Fortran, we need to declare an array, read it, then process it.\n\nFirst, variables declaration:\n\nThe main programming steps would be:\n\nRead n. If n is 1, read that number and output it, then exit.\n\nElse, read the array, which has n elements.\n\nSort it.\n\nThen, check if all elements are zero (the sorted array's last element is zero?), since if sorted array has all elements zero, then output 0 immediately.\n\nOtherwise, proceed into a loop that works similarly as done in Java. Wait, but what is the process?\n\nThe main loop is a while(true), meaning repeat until something breaks. Inside, when a.size ==1, set ans and break.\n\nSo, while the size of a (the array) is greater than 1, we process it through function func, and loop.\n\nWait, in the Java code, each iteration: \n\nwhile true: \n   check a.size ==1? then break.\n   a= func(a); \n   repeat until a's size is 1.\n\nYes, so until the array reaches 1 element.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the function 'func' needs to return a new array, so the function must return an array. Alternatively, the array might be modified in place, but since in Fortran you can pass arrays by reference, but returning an array as a result can be done in modern Fortran via function returning an array.\n\nLet me think about the functions.\n\nFirst, translating 'func':\n\nPrivate function func(a) returns an ArrayList. \n\nThe Fortran function will need an array input, process it, and return a new array (since Java's ArrayList is altered). \n\nSo in Fortran, the function func would take an integer array of certain size, process it, and return a new array. But for dynamic sizes, perhaps using allocatable arrays.\n\nLet me structure the variables.\n\nMain program outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc118_c\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n    integer :: ans\n    ! read n ...\n    if (n ==1) then ... end if\n    ! else read the array\n    ! sort a\n    ! if all zeros (last element zero?), etc.\n\n    ! loop until a has size 1\n    do while (size(a) > 1)\n        a = func(a)\n    end do\n    ans = a(1)\n    print *, ans\nend program\n\nWait, the function 'func' may be a function that returns a new array. So in the function's code:\n\nBut first, need to think about how the function 'func' works:\n\nIn the Java code, the function 'func':\n\n- Takes an ArrayList A\n- Then loops over each element in a (which is a because it's assigned as a = A, but I think this is redundant).\n\nLet me retrace the 'func' algorithm steps.\n\nThe Java function loops over the list with an index i from 0 to a.size -1.\n\nFor each element at position i:\n\nIf the element is 0, remove it from the list, and since after removing the index is adjusted by decrementing. So effectively skips over the next element. \n\nElse, if min is not zero (so min has been set before?), then replace the element with (element mod min). Then check if that mod is 1: if so, exit with 1.\n\nWait, in Java's 'func' function, the min is initialized to 0. So during the loop over elements:\n\nFirst, the loop processes each element, skipping zeros.\n\nThen, for non-zero elements:\n\n- if min is 0 (i.e., first non-zero element), set min = a.get(i)\n\nWait, but during the loop, once min is set, then the subsequent elements are modded by this min. But when that's done, perhaps the min could be replaced?\n\nWait no. The min here isn't tracking the minimum of the array, because in the code the processing logic is a bit different. Let me think: \n\nLooking at the Java code for 'func':\n\nInitially, min is zero.\n\nLoop through the list elements:\n\n- if element is zero: remove it (so it is excluded from further processing).\n\n- else:\n\n   if min is not 0,\n\n      replace (array element) with x mod min. \n\n      if the result is 1, exit.\n\n   else:\n\n      set min to that element. \n\nSo the first non-zero element sets the 'min' value, which could actually be any non-zero element encountered first. \n\nThen subsequent non-zero elements are modded by that min. Also, once the min is set, any subsequent elements in the current loop are modded by min (but after removing zeros). \n\nWait, this process might be building candidates for the GCD?\n\nHmm, this is a bit difficult to see. The main idea might be to progressively calculate the GCD of all elements, but the code's approach might have some optimization.\n\nAlternatively, the function 'func' is working on reducing the array by taking each remaining element mod the current minimum (the first element?), so after sorting, perhaps.\n\nWait, in the main code, the array a is sorted before each pass, but in the 'func' function?\n\nWait in Java, after processing each element and removing zeros, and modifying via mod, they then sort the array again before returning.\n\nAh, after all operations on the list, they sort it again. \n\nWait the code in 'func':\n\nAfter the loop over elements:\n\nThey call Collections.sort(a) and return it.\n\nTherefore, in the loop, the array is sorted, then processed by: remove zeros, and mod the elements with min (which is the first non-zero element?), then sort again for the next pass.\n\nWait this process is a bit different. Let me see step by step:\n\nEach time, when we perform the 'func', the array passed in has been sorted in the previous step.\n\nWait initial sorting before the first call to 'func':\n\nThe main code, after reading the elements, does a.Collections.sort(a). Then before entering the loop, when the first call is made to 'func', since the array is sorted, perhaps the elements are in ascending order. So during the first call:\n\nFirst, in 'func':\n\n- process each element.\n\n- The array is passed to 'func', which copies it as a (unlike C# or Java's array vs ArrayList, but in the code, in 'func', it does ArrayList is passed by reference, so changing a would also affect the parent? Wait no, in Java, in the function, the ArrayList is passed, but 'a' is assigned as a = A. But since in Java, the variables are references, this assignment in the function doesn't make a copy. Therefore, modifying 'a' in the function will mutate the original? Wait no, in the code:\n\nJava's function:\n\nprivate static ArrayList<Integer> func(ArrayList<Integer> A) {\n    ArrayList<Integer> a = A;\n    ... process elements in a ...\n    return a;\n}\n\nHere, since 'a' is a reference to A, any modification to 'a' would affect the original A. So this might be an issue, but in the main code, when after each call to func:\n\nafter returning a = func(a), so each iteration replaces the a list with the processed one.\n\nBut perhaps the function is intended to return a new list, but in this code, it's actually being modified in place. Hmm, but that might be incorrect? Wait because modifying 'a' as a = A, but then modifying the list would be the same list. Wait the problem here is that in Java, when you pass an ArrayList to a function, you can modify it's content, but in this case the code in func is modifying the input A by reference. However, in the function when the original a is passed via the function's param, so they're passing the original ArrayList, then in the function, the manipulation of elements could be affecting it. But since the function is supposed to return A transformed, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code copies A into a new list a? But no, the assignment is a = A, which is just a reference.\n\nWait in Java, to modify the list without affecting the original, you need to create a copy. So the code in 'func', when it's doing a.get(i) mod min, and removing elements \u2014 but since a is the same as the original A, then when we call a.remove(i), it would actually modify A's contents. \n\nHmm this might lead to unexpected issues. Wait maybe in the code's logic, the ArrayList being used is supposed to be processed, and passed back by the function. So the Java code's 'func' should return a new modified list (since otherwise, since A is pass-by-reference, the A would be modified in place). So perhaps the code in Java is flawed here?\n\nWait perhaps there's an error in the Java code. Let's see. The function's first line is:\n\nArrayList<Integer> a = A;\n\nBut these references both point to the same object. So any changes made to 'a' (the list elements) are directly modifying the original A, hence after the function returns, because the return is 'a' (the same object as A), so in the function's case, this line is redundant; but the problem is that the function is intended to return the modified list, but since it's done in place, returning it is okay, but perhaps the code's flow is okay?\n\nAssuming that in Java, the function is correctly implemented, then in translating to Fortran, the function should take the array, process it (maybe creating a new array as a result), and return it.\n\nNow, thinking about the steps in 'func' for Fortran:\n\nStep by step:\n\n1. Remove all zeros from the input array 'a_in' (input). \n\n   So in Fortran, creating a new array without the zero elements. Since in the JAVA code, they loop and remove elements (i.e., remove an element and adjust the index).\n\n   So how to do this in Fortran? Let me think. We can loop through the input array and collect the non-zero elements, storing them in a temporary array, then set the new array to this. But how?\n\n2. Initialize min as zero. Then loop through the elements in the filtered array (without zeros):\n\n   For each element, first, if min is still 0 (initial state), set min to that element.\n\n   Else (min is set), then replace the current element with (element mod min). \n\n   Additionally, check after the mod if the mod result is 1. If so, then the program exits (immediately outputs 1 and exits), because presumably the next GCD would be 1, so can shortcut.\n\n3. After processing all elements, sort the new array, then return it.\n\n   Wait but also after mod, we have to collect these elements.\n\nWait the process seems to be:\n\nAfter removing zeros, the array contains all non-zero elements. Then, in the loop, for the current array:\n\n   Determine min (the first element after first non-zero? Or the first element after sorted?)\n\nWait the min in the code is the first non-zero element (because min is initialized as zero, so the first element that is non-zero found during the first iteration sets min). But in the input array (filtered of zeros) and possibly sorted? No, because the step 1 processing would have removed zeros but not kept sorted. Wait, but in the code, in the function, after the loop, the array is sorted again before returning.\n\nWait let me retrace the code's flow for the 'func':\n\nIn the function's loop, first, the array may contain zero elements which are being removed.\n\nAfter filtering zeros, we process each element:\n\nFirst element with non-zero is set to min (since initial min was 0). So min is the first element in the filtered array (after removing zeros). \n\nThen the other elements are modded by this min. But during this processing, for each element, they replace it with (element mod min). \n\nThen, check if that result is 1: if yes, program exits.\n\nThen, after processing all elements, they sort the array again (so perhaps to find the next smallest element in the next iteration?)\n\nHence the process is:\n\nThe array after removing zeros, modifying elements by mod with the first non-zero element (the min), then sorting again. \n\nWait perhaps this is a way to compute the GCD of the array elements.\n\nLike, suppose the first element after sorting (since next loop will sort the array) is the smallest element, then the mod operation is similar to the GCD algorithm step (where you mod larger elements by the smaller one), and then proceed with the remainders and the min.\n\nWait but this logic might compute GCD over steps. \n\nIn any case, the code's algorithm steps need to be accurately translated to Fortran, even if I'm not 100% sure what they do, but the Java code available.\n\nNow, to code this:\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the functions can return arrays only in Fortran 90 or later (as procedures with arrays as results). \n\nThe function func needs to take an integer array, process it, and return an integer array.\n\nFirst, let's think about the steps in func:\n\n1. Remove all zeros from the array. Let's have the input array 'a_in' as an integer array,_create a new array 'new_a' (allocatable) where all zero entries are excluded. \n\n2. Now, create this new array, then process each element to compute mod. \n\n3. Compute min: initially zero. Loop through the new array (non-zero elements), first occurrence sets min. Then for others mod min.\n\nEvery time, check if any element modulo min becomes 1. If yes, output 1 and stop.\n\nWait, but in the code, as soon as any element mod min is 1, it prints 1 and exits the whole program. So in Fortran, during processing in 'func', if such occurs, we have to immediately terminate.\n\nSo the function has a block that, after doing mod, if any element is 1, then we have to print 1 and terminate.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can't print and exit - that would need to be in the main function, perhaps. How to handle this?\n\nHmm, the problem in the code is that in the function's loop:\n\nIn the else clause where min != 0:\n\na.set(i, a.get(i) % min); \n\nthen, if the value at a.get(i) is now 1, then print 1 and exit.\n\nBut in the function, which is part of the code's processing, if any such condition occurs, the program terminates immediately. \n\nThus, in Fortran, this logic requires that while processing inside func, if a mod result is 1, then the program must exit, meaning the function can't just return a value.\n\nSo, the best approach would be to have the function raise a flag whenever it encounters such a condition, and at the caller, check and terminate.\n\nAlternatively, restructure the code so that instead of immediately exiting, the function returns a code indicating that it should break?\n\nAlternatively, use a parameter to return an error level or status.\n\nAlternatively, since in the Java code, the printing and exiting is done in the function, we need to have the same in Fortran.\n\nThus, inside the function, if during the processing we find 1, then we can write something like:\n\nwrite (*,*) 1\n\nstop\n\nAlternatively, how can we propagate this from the function to the program?\n\nPerhaps better to structure the function to return not only the array but also a flag indicating if early termination is needed.\n\nLet me think structuring.\n\nSo, the function 'func' can return both the array and status:\n\nSo, in Fortran, a function can return a derived type that includes the new array and a flag.\n\nAlternatively, the function can have an optional output argument indicating if it found a 1 in the mod operation, triggering the main program to exit.\n\nAlternatively, make the function have an integer status return (0 for proceed, 1 for found 1), but in Fortran, the function return value type needs to be compatible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps raising an error would help, but that might be complex in competitive programming code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function will return the array, and if the 1 is found, output it and return a 'special' array (like all zeros or something), but the main program would have to check the array after each function call. But in the code, if the mod returns a 1, it prints and exits, so the early termination is immediate once any mod becomes 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to handle this in Fortran is by writing directly to screen the 1 and aborting the program when detected within the function.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran function func, after each mod operation, check if the new element is 1. If so, immediately write '1' and exit the program. \n\nIn Fortran, functions can't have I/O, but subroutines can. Wait, actually, any subroutine can perform I/O, including functions. However writing in functions might be controversial, but acceptable.\n\nWait no, the function can have I/O. The key is that in the code, when in 'func', if a result of mod is 1, then we must output that and terminate.\n\nAlternatively, to make this manageable, perhaps I can structure the function as a subroutine that returns the new array and a flag. The main program calls the subroutine, handles the flag accordingly.\n\nLet me outline:\n\nIn the main program:\n\nloop:\n\n    call func(a, new_a, has_one)\n    if (has_one) then\n        print *, 1\n        stop\n    end if\n    a = new_a\n    if (size(new_a) ==1) then\n        exit\n    end if\n\nIn the subroutine func: do the processing, returns new_a and has_one.\n\nSo let's proceed:\n\nFirst, in the Fortran code:\n\nThe main program:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc118_c  \n    implicit none  \n    integer :: n  \n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), new_a(:)  \n    logical :: has_one  \n    integer :: ans  \n\n    read *, n  \n    if (n == 1) then  \n        read *, ans  \n        print *, ans  \n        stop  \n    end if  \n\n    allocate(a(n))  \n    read *, a[:] ! assuming correct read syntax?  \n    ! replace with loop if needed  \n! actually in Fortran you have to read element-wise.  \n\nWait to read n elements into an array:\n\nmaybe like this:\n\nread *, (a(i), i = 1, n)\n\nYes.\n\n    call quicksort(a, 1, n) ! Implement a sorting routine or use the ISO_C_BINDING? Or perhaps in Fortran, if the compiler has an intrinsic sort.\n\nWait Fortran's intrinsic function is ISORT, where you can do a = [array elements]: sort.\n\nWait in Fortran 90+, you can use the `sort` function, but I think for an array, you can do: call merge_sort(a) using a helper function. \n\nAlternatively, use a procedure to sort the array. Since in the Java code, the sort is done with a standard sort (ArrayList's Collection.sort which is natural order). \n\nSo for Fortran, perhaps better to implement a sort function. Since the array can be sorted with a built-in sort, perhaps using the ISO intrinsic. \n\nWait, actually, in Fortran, you can sort an array like this:\n\ncall merge_sort(a)\n\nBut you need a function to sort. Since the code may require to sort integers in ascending order, perhaps write a subroutine to sort. \n\nAlternatively use the built-in fortran functions: the index routine and then reindex the array, but perhaps better to code a simple bubble sort (though inefficient, but maybe for constraints). \n\nAlternatively, compiler-dependent.\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\nIf a is an integer array of size n, then you can sort it using the 'sort' function:\n\nFor example, in\u797a\n\ninteger, allocatable :: order(:)\ncall mergesort(a, order)\n\nbut you need compliance? Alternatively, perhaps use the intrinsic routines available in Fortran 90+.\n\nHmm, alternatively, let's assume that we'll write a helper function to sort the array in-place.\n\nWait, or maybe use the 'isort' function? Let me recall.\n\nIn fortran we can do the following:\n\ncall system_sort(a) but without knowing the right function...\n\nAlternatively implementing a bubble sort or insertion sort.\n\nAlternatively, use a helper subroutine which sorts the array.\n\nAs this is necessary, let's write:\n\nBut maybe better to proceed incrementally.\n\nLet's first outline the code.\n\nMain program:\n\nRead n, if n ==1: done.\n\nElse, read array, sort them. Then:\n\nCheck all elements are zero? \n\nWait, after sorting, if the last (maximum) element is zero, then output 0 and exit. Because all elements are zero.\n\nYes. So after sorting:\n\nif (a(n) == 0) then  \n    print *, 0  \n    stop  \nendif  \n\nThen enter the loop:\n\ndo while (size(a) > 1)  \n    call func(a, new_a, has_one)  \n    if (has_one) then  \n        print *,1  \n        stop  \n    end if  \n    a = new_a  \nend do  \n\nans = a(1)  \nprint *, ans  \n\nSo the loops take the array through func, and so on.\n\nNow, the function/subroutine 'func':\n\nDouble the name may be okay.\n\nsubroutine func(a_in, new_a, has_one)\n\nimplicit None  \ninteger, intent(in) :: a_in(:)  \ninteger, allocatable, intent(out) :: new_a(:)  \nlogical, intent(out) :: has_one  \n\ninteger :: i, min_val, size_in, new_size  \ninteger, allocatable :: tmp(:)  \n\ntemporary arrays and variables.\n\nFirst, process step of removing all zeros:\n\nThe size_in is size(a_in). \n\nFirst, count non-zero elements to determine the size of tmp.\n\ncount = number of elements \u22600  \n\nallocate( tmp(count_non_z(a_in)) )\n\nthen loop through a_in and fill tmp with non-zero elements.\n\nfunction to count? Or compute inline.\n\nCompute count:\n\ncount = 0  \ndo i = 1, size(a_in)  \n    if (a_in(i)/=0) then  \n        count +=1  \n    end if  \nend do  \n\nallocate( tmp(count) )\n\nthen loop again, copy non-zero elements into tmp.\n\ntmp_idx =1  \ndo i =1, size(a_in)  \n    if (a_in(i)/=0) then  \n        tmp(tmp_idx) = a_in(i)  \n        tmp_idx +=1  \n    end if  \nend do  \n\nSo now tmp is the filtered array of non-zero elements.\n\nThen, set min_val =0 \n\nprocess tmp array:\n\nloop through each elem in tmp, compute mod, set min_val etc.\n\nthen check mod result for 1 any time. \n\nhas_one initially is false\n\nloop i =1 to len(tmp)\n\nelement_val = tmp(i)\n\nif (min_val /=0 then:\n\n    new_val = element_val modulo min_val  \n\n    If new_val ==1, then set has_one = true.\n\n    then, if has_one is true, we can set new_val to 1 and proceed, but we need to break early if possible?\n\n    since in this case, the program should exit, so once any such element is found, we can proceed.\n\n    wait in the Java code, the code immediately does System.exit(0) when any mod is 1.\n\n    so in this subroutine, if during the loop, has_one is set to true (found a mod 1), then need to return and let the calling program exit.\n\nSo in this subroutine:\n\nWhen processing each element:\n\nelement is the current element in tmp (non-zero array)\n\ninitialize min_val to 0.\n\nWe\u2019re going through the tmp array and building a new array (maybe to store mods?), or modifying it in place?\n\nWait in the Java code's 'func' function:\n\nThey modify the list elements in place, replacing with mod min_val.\n\nSo perhaps first, the tmp array is the current non-zero elements.\n\nThen, process each element to set mod values, while track min_val:\n\nInitialize min_val =0, new elements array (maybe again):\n\nperhaps create a new array to collect the modified elements.\n\nWait here it's getting complex. Let's think again step by step.\n\nIn the Java loop:\n\nProcessing the list (tmp array):\n\nfor each element a.get(i):\n\nIf min_val is zero: set min_val to that element.\n\nElse:\n\n   new_val = a.get(i) mod min_val  \n\n   replace the current element with new_val  \n\n   if (new_val ==1), then output 1 and exit program.  \n\nso during this processing:\n\nThe order of processing is important, and the min_val is first element of the array (since the min_val is set when first non zero, which in the tmp array is first element).\n\nWait, but in the tmp array, the order is the original order, since the elements were simply copied from a_in (the sorted array?). \n\nWait in the original array passed to 'func' was the sorted array from the previous step?\n\nWait no, in the Java code, the func function's processing is:\n\nThe 'a' array is a parameter which has already been sorted before being passed to 'func', since in the main code, before entering the loop, the array is sorted (Collections.sort(a)). \n\nWait the main code's steps after reading the array:\n\n    for (int i =0; i <n; i++) a.add sc.nextInt();\n\n    Collections.sort(a); so a is sorted.\n\n    // then check all zeros?\n\n    // then enter the loop: while (true) { go through func }\n\n    each iteration after the first call to func, the returned array is stored in a again.\n\nBut in Java, each call to func may modify the list (since it's passed as a reference?), which is sorted again inside the 'func' function.\n\nAh! Wait, in the Java function 'func', after the processing (replacing elements and mod), it then sorts the a array again before returning. \n\nYes: in the Java 'func' function's last step is:\n\n    Collections.sort(a); \n\nThus, the resulting array from 'func' is the processed elements (non-zeros with mods applied) and sorted. \n\nSo the processing in Java's 'func' steps:\n\n1. Start with the input array, which is sorted in incoming (since from previous steps).\n\n2. Remove zeros.\n\n3. Compute each elements mod min (the first element) \n\nBecause the first non-zero element (which, after sorting, is the first element of the array), since min_val was set initially to zero, so the first element in the non-zero array becomes min_val (assuming array isn't empty).\n\nThen others are modified mod min_val. \n\n4. Then, check any mod results (mod min_val) produces a 1? If yes, exit immediately.\n\n5. Then sort the new array again, and return it.\n\nWait so, in the processing, after generating the new elements (the available modded elements), we then sort them again.\n\nSo in the Fortran function:\n\nAfter processing the non-zero elements (tmp array):\n\nInitialize min_val =0 \n\nCreate a new array (modified array):\n\nanother tmp array? Let me think.\n\nWe can proceed as follows:\n\nProcessing the tmp array (non-zero elements from a_in):\n\nmin_val = 0 \n\nneed to create an output array (new_elements):\n\nallocate new_elements for the same length (but some elements may become zero?)\n\nWait no, in Java code, after processing the elements, do they ever become zero?\n\nWait the mod operator: a mod b can sometimes be zero (when a is a multiple of b).\n\nIn the Java code's 'func' function:\n\nAfter setting new_val = element mod min_val, \n\nif new_val is 1 \u2192 output and exit.\n\nElse, they keep new_val in a.\n\nIn particular, when new_element is 1, they exit.\n\nWait if new_val is zero, then it's stored as mod?\n\nIn code, the zero being stored may later be removed.\n\nWait after processing, the new array (the current 'a' list after mod) is then passed to another iteration, but in 'func' after sorting.\n\nWait in the Java code's 'func':\n\nAfter modifying the elements (replacing with mods):\n\nThen, before returning, it does another Collections.sort(a), which may push zeros to the front, then zero elements may be processed?\n\nNo, but in programming terms, the elements after mod can be zero? For example, when element mod min_val is 0, then the element becomes 0, which will be later removed in next function calls.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo for the processing step (in the function 'func'):\n\nWe have to process the non-zero elements (tmp is non-zero) from the array input to 'func', then compute their mod min_val, updating to new elements.\n\nStep by step:\n\nInitialize min_val =0 \n\nCreate new_elements array, same size as tmp (non-zero elements).\n\nLoop over each element in tmp: \n\nFOR i =1 to len(tmp)\n\nelement = tmp(i) \n\nIf min_val ==0:\n\n   set min_val to element \n\n   then add to new_elements the element (since it's the first one) ?\n\nWait no. Because after min_val set to first element (since that was first in the loop), \n\nThe first element in tmp is the first of the non-zero elements (as tmp is the incoming array, which was not necessarily sorted). Wait the incoming array is passed as the previous step's processed array sorted again.\n\nWait, this is a bit of a confusion point.\n\nWait, in the previous steps, after calling func, the resulting array is a sorted array (because the code in func ends with a sort).\n\nThus, the current array 'a' in the loop is passed to 'func', which operated on it:\n\n 1. Remove the zeros (store in tmp)\n\n 2. Process elements mod with the first non-zero element (but minus?)\n\nWait the first element of tmp is the new min_val (the first element since in tmp is the non-zero elements. But for tmp being unsorted?\n\nAh! Here is a bug in previous logic.\n\nWait in the Java code's 'func', the 'a' list being passed to the function is a sorted list from previous step. However, when zeros are removed, the remaining list (tmp's elements) could be just the non-zero elements in the original sorted order.\n\nThus, the first element in tmp (called a in the code) after zero removal is the first non-zero element.\n\nSo min_val is set to the first element (the minimum? Since sorted).\n\nThus, in the Java code's processing, the min_val is first non-zero element (since the array was sorted), which would be the smallest non-zero element after any leading zeros were removed.\n\nTherefore, the min_val is actually the minimum non-zero element, so all other elements will be mod by this min_val.\n\nIn this way, this reduces the array's elements to their remainder mod the current min value (smallest).\n\nThe process is similar to computing the GCD via successive remainders (Euclidean algorithm).\n\nThus, the Fortran function needs to do the same steps.\n\nThus, steps in the function:\n\nFirst, the input array is an array sorted in ascending order.\n\nThe function takes this sorted array. \n\n1. Remove zeros (placed in tmp array)\n\n2. If all elements were zeros (tmp is length zero?), impossible here? Because Java code before calling the loop first checks: if after first sort, the last element was zero, the program had terminated.\n\nWait no, because the main code after initial sort has this:\n\nif (a.get(a.size() -1)==0) { print 0; exit; }\n\nSo if initial array has all zeros, it would exit, so the loop never occurs, so 'func' is never called.\n\nThus, when entering 'func' function, the array will have at least one non-zero element. Thus in code, tmp's count is at least 1.\n\n3. Initialize min_val. Since the first element of tmp (non-zero elements in the original sorted array's order) is the first non-zero, which is the first element of the sorted array. Hence, that is the first non-zero (the minimal one).\n\nBut in Fortran, if the tmp array is processed as above, the sorted array's first element is the minimum non-zero.\n\nHence, for tmp array, in step 1, we can take it in original order (since they were sorted).\n\nWait the tmp array is just the non-zero elements of the input array in their original order (the original array had been sorted).\n\nThus, the first element of tmp array is the min_val (because the input array is in sorted order).\n\nTherefore, processing the tmp array:\n\nLoop through each element of tmp (the non-zero elements of the sorted array, in order).\n\nThen:\n\nmin_val gets set to first element (tmp(1)). \n\nThen for other elements (from 2 to size(tmp) ):\n\ncompute new elements as element mod min_val.\n\nBut if during any of those steps (after mod) a new element's mod is 1, then output 1 and exit.\n\nAdditionally, if any mod remainder is zero, that element becomes zero (so in subsequent steps, will also be removed via the zero-removal step).\n\nSo processing steps:\n\nAfter setting min_val = tmp(1).\n\nInitialize new_elements array.\n\nallocate ( new_elements(size(tmp)) )\n\nnew_elements(1) = min_val (first element, because mod min_val with itself is 0? Wait no, the first element is min_val = tmp(1). The first element is min_val, so mod of it by min_val is zero?\n\nWait no! Because min_val is set to tmp(1). The first element's mod min_val would be 0, but wait, no:\n\nWait when processing the first element (tmp(1)), the first element's processing is when min_val is set:\n\nOriginally, min_val =0. \n\nThen in the first iteration (i=1):\n\nmin_val was 0.\n\nThus, set min_val = tmp(1)\n\nThe element is tmp(1) \u2192 thus, the new element is unchanged (since min_val == tmp(i) \u2192 mod 0?\n\nWait, wait: Wait in the code, during first element (i=1):\n\nif (min_val ==0 \u2192 which is true, since initially zero).\n\nThus, min_val is set to tmp(1), but the element is the first element \u2192 so is it left or not?\n\nWait in Java's code, after removing zeros, the first element (i starts from zero?) in the loop may be part of the processing.\n\nWait in Java\u2019s for (int i=0; ... ), but in our step-by-step:\n\nIn the first iteration (i=0, in Java's loop over a after zeros removed):\n\nthe first element is tmp[0], which was the former a.get(0).\n\nBut in the code, the first iteration (min_val is zero) so:\n\nelse:\n\n   min = a.get(i) \u2192 this is the first non-zero element (set as min).\n\nBut the array's processing of the current element?\n\nWait in Java, the first element's position in a (after zeros removed) is set to min_val, but the mod processing isn't done for that element? \n\nWait the code for the first element (after zeros removed):\n\nThe first element causes the min_val to be set. The rest of the elements (from next) are then modded by that min_val.\n\nThe first element itself: what happens to it?\n\nAh! The first element is min_val, but in the code, after setting the min_val, it's not being modded, so remains as min_val ?\n\nWait in the Java loop:\n\nfor the first non-zero element (i, which is the first)\n\na.get(i) is min_val:\n\nset min_val to it.\n\nthen the current element (a.get(i)) isn't replaced? \n\nWait yes, because the condition was else in the 'if (a.get(i) ==0' \u2192 no, so it goes into the else clause, and checks if min_val is not 0?\n\nWait the code's logic for a non-zero element is:\n\nif (min !=0):\n\n  a.set(i, mod)\n\nelse:\n\n  min = current element \n\nSo the first element (i) where min was 0:\n\nElse clause is entered:\n\n set min = current element \u2192 but the current element remains unchanged? \n\nThus, first element stays as min.\n\nThen proceed to the subsequent elements (starting from i=1 in the first example).\n\nTherefore, the new elements array:\n\nThe first element is min (no change), the others are mod min.\n\nThus, when the function returns, after applying that mod, the array (which after sorting) includes min, along with mod results (which can be 1?)\n\nThus in the Fortran's processing steps within the function:\n\nFor each element in tmp (non-zero elements in order):\n\nInitialize new_elements array.\n\nloop over each element in tmp:\n\ni from 1 to size(tmp):\n\nelement = tmp(i)\n\nif min_val ==0: \n\ncurrent processing on first iteration, so set min_val = element \u2192 \n\nthen store element in new_elements (no mod needed? since you are the first and set min_val to yourself?)\n\nWait, yes. \n\nwhile for other elements (i>1):\n\n then compute new_val = element mod min_val \n\n then set new_elements( i ) = new_val \n\n additionally check if new_val is 1 \u2192 return early.\n\nSo the first element remains as is (possible).\n\nBut the second and following elements are mod min_val.\n\nThus in Fortran:\n\nAfter getting tmp array (non-zero elements from a_in), sorted, but in the function.\n\nActually wait: in Java, the array being passed to 'func' is the previous array that had been sorted (since in the loop, after calling the function, the array is set to the function return, which was sort again).\n\nThus in Java, the arrays passed to 'func' are always sorted. So the tmp array is the non-zero elements in sorted order (so first element is min_val).\n\nThus in the function, the first element of tmp is already the smallest value.\n\nThus in Fortran, when processing tmp, we can:\n\nCompute min_val is first element.\n\nThen for all elements in tmp:\n\nnew_val equals:\n\nif index 1 \u2192 element is min_val \u2192 remains the same?\n\nWait yes. \n\nbecause for the first element, when processing, we set min_val to it, but then mod is not applied.\n\nOther elements (indices 2 and beyond):\n\nmod.\n\nThus, the new elements array is:\n\nFor i=1: new_val is element (tmp(1) \u2192 min )\n\nFor i=2 to count: new elements \u2192 mod min_val.\n\nSo:\n\nallocate new_elements( count )\n\nnew_elements(1) = min_val = tmp(1)\n\nthen for i from 2 to count:\n\nnew_val = tmp(i) mod min_val \n\nnew_elements(i) = new_val \n\n also check if new_val is 1 \u2192 set has_one to true, and we'll end early.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nmin_val = tmp(1)\n\nnew_elements(1) = min_val \n\nhas_one = .false. \n\nthen loop over elements 2 to count:\n\nelement = tmp(i)\n\nnew_val = mod( element, min_val)\n\nif (new_val ==1) then \n\n    has_one = .true.  \n\n    compute this but continue to update new_val?\n\n    no, but according to code, once any occurrence reaches mod 1, we must print and exit.\n\nThus, in the subroutine 'func' :\n\nwhen we find any new_val =1:\n\n    we have to call exit functions.\n\n thus, while building new_elements, if any new_val is 1, then:\n\n    has_one should be set to true and break the loop.\n\nBut after returning, the main program will check has_one and exit.\n\nAlternatively, do we have to return early?\n\nHmm. The Java code, upon hitting the mod result 1, will directly print and exit. In the subroutine, we have to do the same: if any new_val is 1, then signal that in has_one, after which the main program can terminate.\n\nThus, in the code of the function:\n\nThe loop over the elements (starting from second element):\n\ndo i=2 to count:\n\n    element = tmp(i) \n\n    new_val = mod( element, min_val )\n\n    if (new_val ==1) then \n\n        has_one = .true. \n\n    end if \n\n    new_elements(i) = new_val \n\nend do\n\nthen, after the loop, check if has_one is true. \n\nBut in code it's a break, so need to proceed.\n\nThus, the function proceeds to build the new_elements array, and if has_one is true, then return has_one as true.\n\nOnce returned by the function, the main program will output 1 and exit.\n\nThus, the processing of new_elements array is done correctly.\n\nOnce done, we have a new array new_elements, which may contain zeros (if mod was zero).\n\nThen we have to:\n\nremove zeros from new_elements.\n\nWait no, because in the next step of the function, after making the new_elements array, we have to sort them, including any zeros? \n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nafter processing the mod and so on, the next step is:\n\n    Collections.sort(a) \n\nThus, the new array is sorted (which includes any new zeros introduced from mod) and stored as a, then returned.\n\nWait, in the code, the list 'a' after the processing (mods and so on) will have elements that may be zero (if any mod resulted in zero).\n\nThen, then after processing all elements (mods), the code sorts the list again, and removes zeros? No: in the next processing steps, any zeros will be removed in the next run of the function.\n\n Wait in code:\n\nthe 'sort' happens after all processing, including mods and setting of zeros.\n\nIn the next iteration of the loop in the main function, the a will be passed to 'func' again, and the first thing 'func' does is remove zeros.\n\nThus, the current function step is:\n\nafter creating new_elements, which may have zeros (from new_val mod min_val), sort it.\n\nThen remove zeros in the next iteration.\n\nWait\uff0c in the function's 'func':\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nthe processing happens inside the function, and after initial steps, finally:\n\n    Collections.sort(a);\n\n    return a;\n\nThus after the mods, the array is sorted, including any zeros.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter building new_elements:\n\nthe resulting new array (after mods) is not yet sorted. But the desired result of 'func' is to return a sorted array.\n\nWait between processing and return:\n\nthe new array (new_elements) is the modded array (elements may have zeros), which must be sorted and then the zeros removed next time may be handled.\n\nWait step-by-step:\n\nAfter processing new_elements array (with possible zeros), the subroutine has to sort it (only the new elements array (non-zero?)).\n\nWait the new_elements array contains elements NOT necessarily the only non-z eros (as after mod, some may be zero).\n\n because for example, when an element mod min is zero.\n\nSo the new_elements array is:\n\nincludes elements like mod min_val \u2192 which could be 0 to min_val-1.\n\nThus zeros can be present in new_elements.\n\n Thus, the function step is to:\n\nNow, after the new_elements array is processed (including possibly 0's):\n\nthen the subroutines need to return the following array:\n\nthe new_elements sorted, then to assist in the next step, need to return the sorted array minus zeros? \n\nNo, according to the code:\n\nAfter the function's processing, it returns the array 'a' after sorting ( includes all elements, including any zeros) and then in the next iteration of the main loop, 'func' will remove zeros first steps.\n\nThus, the function in Fortran must:\n\nAfter computing new_elements array (including the modded elements and possible zeros):\n\nsort the new_elements array.\n\nthen, return this sorted array (with zeros included) as the function's output (the 'new_a')?\n\nYes. Thus the final steps in the function:\n\nsort the new_elements array.\n\n then, create a new array ( call it new_sorted?), sorted.\n\n then new_a is that array.\n\n thus in Fortran:\n\nThe logic is:\n\nAfter modifying the array to new_elements, \n\nsort new_elements using the sort routine, \n\nthen return this sorted array (including zeros) as the new_a.\n\n thus in code:\n\n subroutine:\n\ntmp is the non-zero elements of the input array. \n\n processed to the new_elements array,\n\n then sorted (array new_elements):\n\ncall sort subroutine on new_elements.\n\nthen assign new_a = new_elements.\n\nWait thus:\n\nallocate( new_elements_sorted(allocate) , but no.\n\n\u6211'll have to find a way to sort the new_elements array.\n\nAlternatively, after building the new_elements array (of size count), we call a sort procedure on it, then return it as new_a. \n\nThus in code:\n\n subroutine func(a_in, new_a, has_one)\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: a_in(...)\n   integer, allocatable, intent(out) :: new_a(:)\n   logical, intent(out) :: has_one\n\n    process to create tmp array (non-zero elements)\n\n    compute min_val = tmp(1)\n\n    build new_elements array via loop.\n\n    then call the sort routine.\n\n    new_a = sort(new_elements)\n\n    has_one = check within loops above.\n\n   etc.\n\nThus perhaps the function is structured as follows:\n\nFirst, creating a temporary array tmp containing non zeros from a_in).\n\nThen, collect into new_elements the processed values (mod min_val, with the first element retained as min_val).\n\nThen sort new_elements.\n\n But in fortran, the sort is separate.\n\n thus:\n\n subroutine perform_sort(array_to_sort)\n\n implicit none\n\n integer, intent(inout) :: array_to_sort(:)\n\n ...\n\n but yes, i have to code a sorting function.\n\n Implementing a sorting procedure in fortran might consume space but it's manageable.\n\nLet me now code the subroutine:\n\n subroutine func( a_in, new_a, has_one)\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: a_in(:)\n   integer, allocatable, intent(out) :: new_a(:)\n   logical, intent(out) :: has_one\n\n   integer :: i, count, size_in, min_val, tmp( size(a_in) )\n\n   count_non_zero = 0\n   do i =1, size(a_in)\n      if ( a_in(i)/=0 ) then\n         count_non_zero = count_non_zero +1\n      end if\n   end do\n\n   allocate( tmp(count_non_zero) )\n\n   count = 0\n   do i =1, size(a_in)\n      if (a_in(i)/=0) then\n         count = count+1\n         tmp(count) = a_in(i)\n      end if\n   end do\n\n   if ( count ==0 ) then \n      call error because the main code should have exited before calling func with all zeros?\n      ! but the condition before the loop ensures this case cannot exist, so maybe not handle.\n   end if\n\n   has_one = .false.\n\n   min_val = tmp(1)\n\n   integer :: new_elements(count), new_val\n\n   allocate( new_elements(count) )\n\n   new_elements(1) = min_val \n\n   do i=2, count\n     element = tmp(i)\n     new_val = mod( element, min_val )\n     new_elements(i) = new_val\n\n     if ( new_val == 1 ) then\n        has_one = .true.\n     end if\n   end do \n\n   ! Now sort new_elements array\n   call my_sort( new_elements )\n\n   allocate( new_a(size(new_elements)) )\n   new_a = new_elements\nend subroutine \n\nWait but here, I have not included the loop that checks for new_val ==1 and returns has_one appropriately.\n\nThis subroutine builds new_elements\u3001 sorts them, then returns new_a as the sorted array.\n\n However, the problem in the loop where new_val is 1 needs to be detected and set as has_one =.true. \n\n yes. Did I miss that? Yes, in the loop over i=2 to count:\n\n whenever new_val is 1, we set has_one to true.\n\nThus, even if the first element is not 1, but any mod result is 1, returns has_one.\n\n Thus in the function, has_one is set if any of those mod results equals 1.\n\nOnce back to main program, we call:\n\n if ( has_one ) then \n\n   print *,'1'\n\n   stop \n\nfi \n\n which is correct.\n\n Now, the function must also sort new_elements before returning the new_a sorted.\n\n Thus, the 'my_sort' subroutine is needed.\n\nImplementing a simple bubble sort for new_elements:\n\nrecursive subroutine my_sort( a )\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, intent(inout) :: a(:)\n\ninteger :: i, j, n, temp\n\nn= size(a)\n\ndo i=1,n-1\n\n   do j=1, n-i\n\n      if (a(j) > a(j+1)) then\n\n         temp = a(j)\n\n         a(j) = a(j+1) \n\n         a(j+1) = temp \n\n      end if \n\n   end do \n\nend do \n\nend subroutine \n\nThis is a simple version.\n\nBut in some cases, it's okay. \n\nThus the function can call this sorting subroutine.\n\n Then, returning new_a as the sorted new_elements.\n\n Now, considering all this, the Fortran program can be structured as outlined.\n\n However, in the calculation of new_elements for first element (i=1):\n\n since the first element is min_val, but in the processing above, new_elements is initialized as min_val for i=1. Then when the rest are mod-ed. \n\n So the elements after processing are:\n\n new_elements array has \n\n the first element is min_val (tmp(1)), \n\n and others are mod min_val.\n\n Then they are all sorted.\n\n Now, in the main program's loop:\n\n the new_a will return the sorted array, and then in the next iteration, 'func' will be called again.\n\n thus all seems okay.\n\n additionally, the first element in the array when passed to 'func' is the sorted array from previous steps.\n\nNow, returning to the main program:\n\n after each call to the function, the new_a is sorted.\n\n Also, in Fortran, all the arrays passed are by reference?\n\n No, in functions/subroutines, arrays are passed by reference, but the dimension must be known or/not.\n\n in the subroutine 'func'\uff0c the input 'a_in' has .dimension ( : ), which is assumed shape, so okay.\n\n The code should proceed without error.\n\nNow, considering code edge cases.\n\n For example, in code's first iteration:\n\n if a contains elements like [2,4,6 ] \u2192 min_val is 2.\n\n after mod, elements become [2, 0, 0]\n\n sorted \u2192 [0,0,2]\n\n the next function call will remove zeros, leaving [2].\n\n thus loop breaks. ans is 2.\n\n which works.\n\n Another case, when during mod_val hits 1:\n\n example initial array [5,3]\n\n first step after sort: [3,5]\n\n func:\n\n tmp array is both elements (since non-zero)\n\n min_val is 3.\n\n new_element:\n\n1 (5 mod 3 is 2? no:5/3 \u2192 mod is 2 (5 -3=2). Wait 5 mod3 is 2. So 3 and 2.\n\n Thus new elements array [3,2]\n\n sort \u2192 [2,3]\n\n wait(size ( you know) \u2192 the new_elements is length 2: elements 3 and 2 \u2192 sorted to (2,3).\n\n Pass into next iteration:\n\n func a_in = [2,3]\n\n \u2192 tmp = both elements.\n\n min_val =2.\n\n second element mod 2 is 3 mod2 \u21921 \u2192 thus has_one is set to .true., and in main program, 1 is printed.\n\n thus correct.\n\n Thus this should work.\n\nAnother case where after mod, one zero is created.\n\nSo the code should handle.\n\n Now, the code needs to compile.\n\n Let me now write out all steps in Fortran.\n\n\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u5728 Fortran\u4e2d\uff0c\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u51fd\u6570\u6b63\u786e\u4f20\u9012\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\n\nFirst\uff0c write the program and functions:\n\n program atcoder_abc118_c  \n    implicit none  \n    integer :: n  \n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), new_a(:)  \n    logical :: has_one  \n    integer :: i, ans  \n\n    read(*,*) n  \n    if (n ==1) then  \n        read(*,*) ans  \n        print *, ans  \n        stop  \n    end if  \n\n    allocate(a(n))  \n    read(*,*) a  \n\n    call my_sort(a)  !
