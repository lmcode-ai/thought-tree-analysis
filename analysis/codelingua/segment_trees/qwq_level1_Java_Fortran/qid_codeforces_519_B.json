    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program reads three sets of integers. The first loop reads 'n' numbers and sums them into 'a'. Then the second loop reads 'n-1' numbers and sums into 'b', and the third does 'n-2' into 'c'. Then it calculates x as a minus b and y as b minus c, then prints x and y.\n\nHmm, so in Fortran, I should replicate this logic. Let me think about the structure. Fortran doesn't have Scanner like Java, so I'll need to read from the standard input using read(*,*) statements. \n\nFirst, the program should start with a program name, maybe call it codeforces_519_B as in Java. Then declare variables: n, a, b, c, x, y as integers. \n\nThe first step is to read n. Then read n integers for 'a', summing them. Wait, in Fortran, how do I read a variable number of integers and sum them? Maybe using a loop. So for each of the three sums, I need loops.\n\nWait, the first loop in Java does 'for (int i=0; i <n; i++) a += sc.nextInt();'. So, in Fortran, I need to read n numbers one by one and add each to a. \n\nSame for the other loops. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read n numbers, add each to a.\n\n3. Read n-1 numbers, add each to b.\n\n4. Read n-2 numbers, add each to c.\n\nThen compute x and y as before.\n\nLet me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, declaring variables. Since Fortran uses implicit typing unless specified, I should add implicit none to specify all variables. \n\nSo:\n\nprogram codeforces_519_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, a, b, c, x, y, i, num\n\nThen read n first:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nInitialize a,b,c to 0:\n\na = 0; b=0; c=0\n\nThen first loop for a:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) num\n    a = a + num\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, loops can be written with do and end do. The variable i starts at 1, up to n. Each time read a number into a temporary variable 'num', then add to a. \n\nThen similarly for the next two loops. \n\nSecond loop for b: n-1 times:\n\ndo i = 1, n-1\n    read(*,*) num\n    b = b + num\nend do\n\nThird loop for c: n-2 times:\n\ndo i = 1, n-2\n    read(*,*) num\n    c = c + num\nend do\n\nThen compute x and y:\n\nx = a - b\ny = b - c\n\nThen output them:\n\nprint*, x\nprint*, y\n\nWait, but in Fortran's print, I can just use print*, to output. \n\nPutting it all together, that seems right. But I need to check variable declarations. The 'num' variable is needed to read each number. So yes, declared as integer. \n\nWait, let me check if there are any integer overflows? Probably, the problem expects that the numbers fit in 32-bit, so in Fortran, using default integers should be okay. \n\nAnother point: in Java, the Scanner is used, but in Fortran, the read statement will read each number from standard input, one by one. The loops should handle exactly the required number of inputs. \n\nWait, in Java, the three for loops read three separate sets. So after the first n numbers, the next n-1, then next n-2. So the Fortran code should do the same, reading sequentially as per the loops. \n\nYes, that should be correct. \n\nTesting edge cases could help. For example, when n is 1, then the second and third loops would read 0 and -1 terms? Wait no. Wait, in Java, if n is 1, then n-1 is 0 so the second loop runs 0 times. n-2 would be -1, but in the loop condition, since i starts at 0, the third loop will not run either. \n\nWait, in Java, the third loop is for (i=0; i <n-2; ...). So if n is 1, then n-2= -1, so the condition is 0 < -1, so zero iterations. \n\nIn Fortran, when doing do i=1, n-2, if n is 1, then the upper bound becomes -1. But in Fortran, loops with the upper bound less than the lower bound are taken as zero iterations. So that's okay. \n\nSo, the code should handle that. \n\nNow, putting all into code.\n\nWait, variables: in Fortran, all variables need to be declared. So variables: n (the input), a,b,c (sums), x,y (results), i (loop counters), and num (the temporary variable to read each number).\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nprogram codeforces_519_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, a, b, c, x, y, i, num\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    a = 0; b = 0; c = 0\n\n    ! Read first set for a\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) num\n        a = a + num\n    end do\n\n    ! Read second set for b\n    do i = 1, n-1\n        read(*,*) num\n        b = b + num\n    end do\n\n    ! Read third set for c\n    do i = 1, n-2\n        read(*,*) num\n        b = b + num  Wait no. Wait the third loop is for c.\n    Oh wait correction: in the third loop, the variable should be c, not b again. So the line is c = c + num.\n\nSo in the third loop, it's:\n\ndo i =1, n-2\n    read*, num\n    c = c + num\nend do\n\nYes, that's a mistake in my draft. So must correct that.\n\nSo the code with the correct variable:\n\nThen compute x = a -b, y = b -c.\n\nFinally, print x and y.\n\nThe final code should look like that.\n\nTesting this mentally:\n\nSuppose n=3.\n\nFirst read 3 numbers, say 1,2,3. sum a=6.\n\nThen read n-1=2 numbers, say 4,5 \u2192 sum b=9.\n\nThen n-2 =1 number, say 6 \u2192 sum c=6.\n\nThen x =6-9 =-3, y =9-6=3. So outputs are -3 and 3.\n\nWait that example: maybe not. Wait let me see.\n\nWait if the third loop is adding into c, for n-2=1 iteration, so 6 \u2192 sum is 6. So c=6. Then y = B (9) minus c (6) \u2192 3. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case. Let n=1.\n\nThen first loop reads 1 number. Let's say 5 \u2192 a=5.\n\nThe second loop runs 0 times, so b remains 0.\n\nThe third loop is 1-2 =-1 \u2192 also 0 iterations, so c stays at 0.\n\nThen x =5-0 =5, y =0-0=0 \u2192 outputs 5 and 0.\n\nWhich seems correct as per Java code.\n\nOkay. I think that translates correctly. So the Fortran code should work."
