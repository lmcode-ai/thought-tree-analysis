So the first pair (positions 0,1) is between 1 and2 in 1-based, so the query L=1 R=2 would capture that pair. The output is indeed 1. Another example: R=3 \u2192 (in 1-based), so the R=3 corresponds to third character (index2 in 0-based). So the R in rui is 3. The query L=2 and R=4 would be L=2 (index1?), R=4 (index3). But in the code's formula, the R is passed as the R from input, which for the string in 1-based is the number given, so the R is R (not R+1 or something). Wait the Java code does rui[right] - rui[left]. So if in the code example above:\n\nfor a query (L=2, R=4) \u2192 right is4 \u2192 rui[4] is 2.\n\nrui[left] is rui[2] which is 1. 2-1=1: correct. So the formula is correct when the queries are 1-based L and R? Wait because if the array's R is the given R (e.g. 4), which is the input's R value. So the formula works because the array's index is exactly the input's R value.",

Wait Java's array is initialized to size n+1, so elements are [0..n]. So to match this in Fortran using 1-based arrays, the array should have 1 to n+1. Thus the loop for frag is up to i<=n?

Wait: Wait, in the Java code's initial conditions:\n\nrui[0] is 0, then for each i from 2 to n, the rui is built as rui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i]. Wait , the Fortran loop starts at i=2 and the first step:\n\nrui(i-1) is rui(1), which is 0, since before the loop, rui is all zero.

The problem statement says that the queries have L <= R <=n. Thus in the code, the variable i in the loop runs up to n, so the code fills up up to rui(n). But in the rui array, since in Fortran it's allocated up to n+1, and the loop's upper limit is n, the rui(n+1) remains zero. But for the problem's queries, since R <=n (1-based?), the right will be <=n so it is okay. Thus the code should work.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the code does. The Java code reads an integer n and q, then a string c. Then it reads q ranges (start and end indices for each query). The main part calculates a prefix sum array where for each position, if the previous two characters are 'AC', it increments a count. Then, for each query, it outputs the difference in the prefix sums at the right and left indices, which gives the number of 'AC' pairs in that range.\n\nHmm, translating to Fortran. Let me think about the data structures. Java uses a char array, so Fortran can have a character array to hold c. The arrays frag and rui are integers. The loops and logic need to be adapted.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the main program doesn't have a class like in Java, so I'll structure the entire code as a program block. The constants like mod aren't used here except maybe in the Java code, but looking at the code provided, the mod constant is there but I don't see it being used. Wait, looking at the Java code again: the mod is 1e9+7 but in the code's logic, is there any modulo operation? The code uses fragments and rui arrays but nowhere do they mod it. So maybe mod's a leftover. But since the user hasn't mentioned it, I'll ignore mod in the code unless it's needed.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n1. Read n, q, then the string c.\n2. Read q ranges (but stored as an array with 1-based indices probably).\n3. Initialize the frag and rui arrays. The frag array in Java is size n+1, from 1 to n (indices go 0-based or 1-based? Let's see: Java is n+1 since loop is up to i= n. So in Fortran, arrays are typically 1-based, so maybe they need to adjust indices.\n\nWait, Java's frag is declared as new int[n+1]. So in Java, it goes from 0 to n. The loop starts at i=2 to i<=n (so indices 2 to n in Java's frag array correspond to i from 2 to n, which would represent characters c starting from 0-based so maybe the code checks if c[i-2] is A and c[i-1] is C? Wait, in Java, the initial c is a char array where c[0] is first character. For i starting from 2, so the 2nd element is considered (i=2 in Java's loop would check positions 0 and 1? Or wait: Let me see.\n\nLooking at the Java code's code block inside the Java loop for frag:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i <=n ; i++) {\n    if (c[i-2] == 'A' && c[i-1] == 'C') {\n        frag[i]++;\n    }\n    rui[i] = rui[i-1]+frag[i];\n}\n\nWait, so when i=2, which is the first possible i, the indices into c would be [0] and [1]. Because Java's c is 0-based (since it's a char[] from sc.next().toCharArray(). So the conditions are checking the i-th elements where i in 2 to n, meaning from the second element (index 1?) Wait no. For each i starting at 2 (in Java), it's checking the previous two characters: c[i-2] (i-2) and c[i-1] (i-1). So for i=2, that's position 0 and 1. The value at position 2 in frag is increased by 1 if those two characters form \"AC\".\n\nThe frag array is cumulative? Actually, frag[i] in Java counts how many times this particular condition is true at position i. Since the condition is that the previous two letters form AC. The frag array will only count the occurrence at position i (maybe that's the 'AC' start?), but then the rui array accumulates these counts. The rui array's i-th element is the sum from frag[1] to frag[i]. Wait no. The initial rui array is set to rui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i]. So the frag[i] is added each time. Wait, perhaps the rui array is the prefix sum, so rui[i] = sum_{k=1 to i} frag[k].\n\nWait, in the initialization for the rui array, in Java, using a loop from i=2 to n, so:\n\nInitially, rui starts as 0 for rui[0], but since the base cases are probably rui[0] =0 ?\nWait, the code initializes the arrays as:\n\nnew for frag and rui. In Java arrays are initialized to zero.\n\nSo the loops:\nInitially rui[1] = rui[0] + frag[1]. (but frag[1] would have been 0 because the loop starts from i=2?\n\nWait the first loop:\n\nThe frag array in Java's fragment part is:\n\nfor (int i=2 to <=n loop):\n\nso for i from 2 to N:\n\nif c[i-2] and c[i-1] is AC, then frag[i] +=1.\n\nSo for each position i (the current i in the loop) corresponds to the pair at positions (i-2, i-1). So frag[i] is used to accumulate the count of AC pairs starting at position i-2?\n\nWait perhaps the frag array is storing 1 at index (i) whenever there's an AC at positions (i-2) and (i-1). Therefore, each frag[i] is 1 or 0.\n\nThe rui array is a cumulative sum up to each position, so rui[i] will be the total number of AC occurrences up to and including the first i positions? Because for each i, rui[i] adds frag[i], so:\n\nrui[2] = rui[1] (which is 0, from frag[1]) + frag[2] (if the first two elements form AC then 1 else 0).\n\nWait, but how does this help in the queries? For example, a query [ L, R ] which in the Java code, they compute rui[R] - rui[L]. Let me see:\n\nSuppose for a range from left = L and right = R. So the code outputs rui[right] - rui[left]. Since rui[i] is the total up to i. To get the count between left+1 to right, subtracting rui[left] from rui[right] would give the sum of frag[left+1 ... right].\n\nWait, maybe the indices are shifted. For example, if the query is given as [range[i][0], range[i][1]], in Java, those values are 1-based because in Java the scanner is taking integers which are probably 1-based (like starting at 1), and then the code uses them as left and right variables. Let me see:\n\nIn the Java code's last loop:\n\nfor the queries, left and right are taken from the ranges' 0 and 1 indexes (the first and second column of the range array). The range was read as range[i][0] = sc.nextInt(), range[i][1] = nextInt();\n\nAssuming the queries are from [left, right], but Java uses 1-based indices? Because the problem may require the ranges to start at 1. So in the Java code, queries are in 1-based because of the problem statement.\n\nWait problem statement for ABC122 C is probably about a string where each query asks between L and R (assuming 1-based indices). The code computes the number of 'AC's in the string from L to R, but how?\n\nIn the frag array:\n\nThe AC pair is at positions i-2 and i-1 (0-based in c array), so that's the ith position (i from 2). So the pair\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e is at starting at the first character of the AC pair (index i-2). The frag[i] counts 1 for that position.\n\nThe rui is cumulative sum up to i. But the query left and right are passed as L and R, and the Java code's output is rui[right] - rui[L]. Since in the query, right \u662f right\u662f the end index.\n\nWait for example, suppose the query is from L to R (the problem's intervals as maybe 1-based). The code is calculating the total between L and R inclusive? Or not exactly. Let me think:\n\nThe rui array's value at position x is the total number of 'AC's in the string from the start up to position (x's corresponding end).\n\nWait, perhaps rui[i] is the total number of 'AC's in the first (i) characters?\n\nWait maybe not, perhaps the rui's indexes correspond to up to position i in the frag array, which is linked to the original positions.\n\nAlternatively, if the frag array's entry is 1 at position i (in Java's terms) when there's an 'AC' in positions (i-2 and i-1), then the AC at position j (in the string indices 0-based) is represented in frag[j+2], because:\n\nsuppose in the string, at position k and k+1, there's AC. Then in i = (k+1)+1? Let's see:\n\nThe positions are 0-based in the char array. For an AC at positions k and k+1, the loop's condition is when i is k+2, since then i-2 = k and i-1 =k+1. So the frag is incremented at index i =k+2.\n\nThus, the position k and k+1 is stored in frag[i] where i =k+2, i ranges from 2 to n (since the loop runs to i<=n, and i starts at 2). Thus, the total number of AC up to position (i) would be rui[i].\n\nTherefore, the rui[R] would give the total AC pairs up to the position corresponding to the end of R, but how exactly?\n\nWait the query's left and right are L and R, but in the Java code, when the problem's L is from 1-based, then when you have a query from L to R, the relevant indices would be the positions in 1-based? So the code's output is the number of AC pairs in the substring starting at L and up to R.\n\nBut the AC pairs are two-character pairs, so they start at L and can go up to R-1 (or R). Let me think:\n\nSuppose the query is from L to R (inclusive in the entire range). Each AC pair is two consecutive characters. So the starting position of such pairs can be from L to R-1. \n\nThe total number of such AC pairs in the query's range would be the count of positions from L to R-1 where the current character and the next form AC.\n\nSo how does the rui array come into play here.\n\nBecause, according to the code, for each AC occurrence at indices (i-2, i-1) (0-based), that contributes to frag[i] where i =k+2 (k being 0-based starting index?), the cumulative array rui[i] holds the total AC pairs from the start up to i.\n\nThus, the query's range from L to R in the problem (using 1-based indices?), so assuming:\n\nIn the problem's terms, for a query L and R (1-based), the corresponding positions in the frag array would need to be adjusted.\n\nWait perhaps the problem's L and R are 1-based and refer to positions in the string.\n\nAssuming the string is s of length n (like c in the Java code).\n\nSo the code computes for the query [L, R], want the number of AC pairs between positions L and R (but since they are pairs of two characters, each pair starts at some index between L and R-1 and ends at the next index).\n\nTherefore, the count is equal to the number of such starting indices s in [L, R-1] where s and s+1 form AC.\n\nThe array rui is tracking the cumulative counts. The value rui[right] holds the total number of such pairs up to the first right characters in some way.\n\nWait in the code, the frag array's entry frag[i] is 1 if the pair at positions (i-2 and i-1) (0-based) is an AC. The rui[i] is the cumulative sum of the first i entries of frag.\n\nThus the rui is rui[i] = number of AC pairs in the first (i-1) characters (since the earliest position is i=2's frag entry corresponds to indices 0 and1, so first two characters. The rui[2] would capture that.\n\nWait no, actually, let's see:\n\nSuppose the string is length n, then the maximum i in frag is n (since the loop is up to i <=n). The last possible pair that can be checked is when i =n, then we look at positions (n-2 and n-1, so the last two characters of the n characters).\n\nThus the total AC pairs from the start are rui[n]. \n\nThen the query L and R:\n\nSuppose the problem's query wants the number of AC pairs from position L to position R inclusive. However since each pair is two characters, the first position is L, and the second must be L+1 < R, so L can be up to R-1. \n\nAlternatively, the query L and R is the number of AC pairs in the entire substring from position L to R (but pairs are only counted if both elements are within the substring). \n\nThus the start index s must be >= L and s+1 <= R. Hence s ranges from L to (R-1).\n\nThe total such pairs can be found as the count between the first occurrence after L-1 (adjusted for 0- or 1-based) and up to the current index R-1 or ?\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach uses the rui array, and for a given interval [L, R], the calculation is rui[R] - rui[L].\n\nWait why?\n\nSuppose the query is L and R (as per Java's variables). If the array's rui is such that rui[i] is the count up to position i in the loop (where each i corresponds to the third character?), let me think with an example.\n\nTake a sample string:\n\nSuppose n=4, the string is \"ACAC\".\n\nThen the characters are 0:A,1:C,2:A,3:C.\n\nThe frag array is initialized to all 0 except where pairs exist.\n\nWe check for each i from 2 to 4 (since n=4):\n\ni=2:\n\nc[0], c[1] is AC \u2192 yes \u2192 frag[2] becomes 1.\n\ni=3:\n\nc[1], c[2] are C and A \u2192 no, so frag[3] is 0.\n\ni=4:\n\nc[2],c[3] \u2192 A and C \u2192 yes \u2192 frag[4] is 1.\n\nThus frag is [0, 0,1,0,1].\n\nrui array is calculated as rui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i].\n\nrui[0]=0.\n\nrui[1]=0+0=0.\n\nrui[2]=0 +1 \u21921.\n\nrui[3]=1+0 \u21921.\n\nrui[4] =1+1=2.\n\nThen the queries. Let's say a query is L=1, R=2 (Java uses 1-based?), the Java's code will do the subtraction rui[R] (2) minus rui[L] (0) \u2192 1, which is correct (the first pair).\n\nAnother query L=2, R=4 \u2192 rui[4] (2) - rui[2] (1) = 1. Which is correct because the second AC pair is at position 2 (third and fourth characters, but actually the pair 2 and3 (indices 2 and3). So in the query from 2 to 4, the count is 1. Correct.\n\nWait but the indices for the string are 0-based. If the queries in the problem are 1-based, like the first character is position1, up to n (the 4th is position4).\n\nSo the first pair (positions 0,1) is between 1 and2 in 1-based, so the query L=1 R=2 would capture that pair. The output is indeed 1.\n\nAnother example: R=3 \u2192 (in 1-based), so the R=3 corresponds to third character (index2 in 0-based). So the R in rui is 3. The query L=2 and R=4 would be L=2 (index1?), R=4 (index3).\n\nBut in the code's formula, the R is passed as the R from input, which for the string in 1-based is the number given, so the R is R (not R+1 or something). \n\nWait the Java code does rui[right] - rui[left]. So if in the code example above:\n\nfor a query (L=2, R=4) \u2192 right is4 \u2192 rui[4] is 2.\n\nrui[left] is rui[2] which is 1. 2-1=1: correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct when the queries are 1-based L and R?\n\nWait because if the array's R is the given R (e.g. 4), which is the input's R value. So the formula works because the array's index is exactly the input's R value.\n\nAh, because the array in Java was built with elements so that the count up to the i-th index (in the frag array's terms) corresponds to the first i-1 characters? Not sure, but the code works.\n\nSo the key points for Fortran:\n\n- Fortran uses 1-based arrays by default (except if declared with (0:). I can declare them as 0-based or 1-based.\n\nOptionally, since the code is dealing with n elements, maybe to make things easier, we can have arrays of size n+1, starting from 1. Let me think.\n\nIn the Fortran code:\n\nDeclare variables:\n\nThe string: c is a character array of length n.\n\nRead n and q, then read the string (possibly via an Allocatable array? Let's see)\n\nWait in Fortran, reading a string can be done via READ(*,*) c. But for the Java's input which is a single word (since the Java code uses sc.next()), so in Fortran, the line:\n\nREAD(*,*) c would get the next line? Or perhaps read it as a single line.\n\nAssuming that the input is taken as a single word. Let's see:\n\nJava uses sc.next(), which reads until next white space (so the problem expects the user to input the n-character string as a single token).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe need to read the string. So perhaps:\n\nparameter for maximum size? Or declare c as a character array of length n.\n\nAlternatively, in modern Fortran, we can read dynamically.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nFirst step:\n\nRead n and q first. So in code:\n\ninteger :: n, q\n\nread(*,*) n, q\n\nThen read the string:\n\nBut first, declare the character array:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: c\n\nthen:\n\nread(*,'(a)') c\n\nBut need to ensure that it's getting the next line correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the input of the string is provided as the next input line, so:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after n and q are read from the first line, then the string is read from the next line (with possibly variable length, up to n characters). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string comes from the same line as the inputs. Probably not. The original Java code uses Scanner's next() which gets the next token (the string immediately after n and q, separated by spaces).\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps better to do the following:\n\nAfter reading n and q, then read the string as a single token:\n\nBut in Fortran, using:\n\nread(*,*)  is list-directed. So if we have variables n, q, then the first read would get n and q from the first line. The next read needs to get the string. But list-directed input may expect each element on a line.\n\nSo perhaps using a format to read the string.\n\nAlternatively, use a do loop.\n\nAlternatively, use the edit descriptor:\n\nread(*,*) n, q\n\nread(*,*) c(1:n)\n\nWait but the string might have leading or trailing spaces. So better to use a read with a( to read until the end of the line. Or read the entire line.\n\nAlternatively, read the string as a whole and take the first n characters.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: temp_str\n\nread(*,'(a)') temp_str\n\nc = temp_str(1:n)\n\nBut better to declare c as adjustable length?\n\nAlternatively, for the problem, since n is known, here's how:\n\nAfter reading n and q, read the next line into a temp, then assign the characters to the c array.\n\nBut let me write code structure in steps.\n\nFirst:\n\n! Read n, q\n\ninteger,parameter :: maxn=2e5 +5\n\ninteger::n, q\n\nread(*,*) n, q\n\nThen the string:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: c\n\nread(*, '(a)', advance='no') c(1:n)\n\nWait not sure. Alternatively:\n\nThe very next input is the string. Let's have:\n\nread(*,*,iostat=istat) c\n\nBut I think it's better to read the string as part of the input following n and q in a single line.\n\nWait the first line has n and q. The second line has the string. So to read the first line's n, q then the second line's string:\n\nread(*,*) n, q\n\nread(*,*) c\n\nAssuming c is a character array of length n.\n\nWait in Fortran, this may work.\n\nBut in order to read, the declaration of c as:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: c\n\nBut n is variable here, so we can't use that. We need to declare an allocatable array.\n\nAh, yes, since n is not known until runtime:\n\ncharacter(len=:),allocatable :: c\n\nBut then, after reading n, we can allocate it.\n\nWait let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst declare allocatable string:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\ninteger :: n, q\n\nread(*,*) n, q\n\nallocate( character(len=n) :: s )\n\nread (*,*) s\n\nthis way s will hold the string. But trimming?\n\nAlternatively, use an array of characters to mimic the Java's char array.\n\nAlternatively, use a 1D array where each element is a character.\n\ncharacter(1), dimension(:),allocatable :: cArray\n\nallocate(cArray(n))\n\nthen read each character:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nthen do i from 1 to n:\n\n    cArray(i) = s(i:i)\n\nBut perhaps easier to read the string as a single line and split into characters.\n\nAlternatively, code step:\n\nFirst, declare variables.\n\nThen the problem came be written as:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, q, i, left, right\n\n   ! declare variables for ranges\n\n   integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: range\n\n   ! declare character array for c\n\n   character(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: c\n\n   ! arrays for frag and rui, 1-based (1 to n)\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: frag, rui \n\n   read(*,*) n, q\n\n   allocate( c(n) )\n\n   read(*, '(a)', advance='no' ) c ! may not be correct.\n\n   ... wait\n\nAlternatively, perhaps read a string and then put each character into c array:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: s\n\nread(*,*) s\n\nc = [(s(i:i), i=1, n)]\n\nBut how to split the string into the array?\n\nAlternatively:\n\ncharacter(len=*,kind=1) :: buffer ! possibly causing issues.\n\nAlternatively, better to read the string properly.\n\nWait perhaps in free form, to read s as a single line:\n\n  read(*, \"(a)\") s\n\nthen assign each character.\n\nBut in Fortran:\n\nMaybe:\n\ncharacter(len = 1) :: c(:)\n\ninteger :: ln \n\nread(*,*) n, q\n\nallocate(c(n))\n\nread(*, '(a)', advance='no') s \n\n! read the rest of the line for the string after the initial read might have some issues. Maybe using read for s with a limit?\n\nBetter to read the string in a different line.\n\nThe first line contains n q, and the second line contains the string.\n\nThus:\n\nfirst line: n, q are read in first read.\n\nThe second line is the string with n letters.\n\nSo:\n\nread(*,*) n,q\n\nread(*, '(a)', advance='no') s\n\ntrim the string to n chars.\n\nthen assign each character.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nread(*, \"(A)\") s ! which read the entire rest of the line into s.\n\nBut after getting s, take first n characters.\n\ncArray would be:\n\ndo i=1,n\n\n   c(i) = s(i:i)\n\nend do \n\nBut for that:\n\n    allocate( c(n) )\n\n    read(*,'(a)',advance='no') s\n\n    s = adjustl(s) ! Not sure if needed, but perhaps the string is n characters.\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        c(i) = s(i:i)\n\n    end do\n\nAlternatively, this might not be necessary if the string is exactly n characters long, but better to read as such.\n\nProceeding, so first:\n\nOnce the c array is read, containing the n characters, then proceed.\n\nNext, the query ranges are read.\n\nThe Java code reads q pairs of (l, r).\n\nIn Fortran, declare a 2D array for the ranges, with q rows and 2 columns.\n\n allocate( range(q, 2), frag(n+1), rui(n+1) )\n\nWait the arrays in Java are from 1 to q, so in Fortran allocate them as (q, 2).\n\nInitializing variables:\n\nInitialize the range array:\n\ndo i=1, q\n\n    read(*,*) range(i,1), range(i,2)\n\nend do\n\nThen, the frag and rui arrays need to be 1-based up to n+1? Because in Java the frag is of size n+1 (which in 0-based up to n), so in Fortran this would be an array of n+1 elements, so indices 1 to n+1.\n\nWait the frag array in Java is from 0 to n (total n+1 elements). The loop runs from i=2 to n, so in Fortran:\n\nallocate(frag( n+1 ), rui( n+1 ) )\n\nfrag = 0\n\nrui =0 \n\nThe initialization is needed first.\n\nThen, for the loops processing frag and rui arrays:\n\nThe loop in Java for i from 2 to n steps by 1:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor(int i=2; i <=n; i++){\n\nThen in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 2, n \n\nif (c(i-2) == 'A' and c(i-1) == 'C' ) then \n\nWait wait: the indices in the character array.\n\nSince in Java, for the string, the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran's c array, if it is 1-based, then for i (starting at 2 in the loop), the condition is c(i-1 -1) ?\n\nWait let me think.\n\nWait in the Java code's for loop for i up to n, their indices for c are [i-2] (since Java's array is 0-based), which is the 0-based index for the current pair considered.\n\nTranslating to Fortran's 1-based c array.\n\nSuppose in Fortran, c is length n, with indexes 1 to n.\n\nWait for the i in Fortran's loop:\n\nThe current i in the loop is equivalent to the Java's i.\n\nThe pair is positions (i-2, i-1).\n\nWait in Java's code's i:\n\nif (i is the loop variable starting from 2 in Java):\n\nThen the first character in the Java array is i-2 \u2192 which is 0-based. The second character is i-1.\n\nIn Fortran arrays with 1-based indexes, the corresponding elements are (i-1 and i), since c(1) is the first character (originally 0), so:\n\njava's position k \u2192 Fortran's k+1 ?\n\nWait let me see:\n\nJava's index 0 (first char) \u2192 Fortran's 1.\n\nJava index 1 \u2192 Fortran's 2.\n\nWait, that's not right. The indices need to be translated properly.\n\nSuppose Java's c array is 0-based, and Fortran's is 1-based.\n\nJava code's loop uses i starting from 2 (Java's integer), and the indices in c are i-2 (which for first i=2 \u2192 0) and i-1 (1).\n\nIn Fortran's terms, to get these first two characters, it would be (i-1) since starting at 1.\n\nWait wait no.\n\nWait for i in Java's loop (starts at i=2):\n\nThe characters are c[i-2] and c[i-1].\n\nIn Java that is:\n\nIn terms of 0-based:\n\nposition0 and position1.\n\nIn Fortran's 1-based array, that is (position 1) and (position 2).\n\nWait so for i=2, the two characters are f_c(1) and f_c(2).\n\nWait wait, Java's c[0] is the first character (unnamed in Java code) stored. In Fortran's array c, which is 1-based, c(1) corresponds to Java's c[0], and so on.\n\nThus, the pair's first and second positions in 0-based Java are (i-2) and (i-1). So for the loop variable i (Java's):\n\nJava's index1: i in Java's code's loop is 2, so the indices are 0 (c[i-2] = c[0]) and c[1] (c[i-1]).\n\nIn Fortran's array that would be c(1) and c(2).\n\nSo to test the same condition, for Fortran's loop variable i:\n\nc(i -1) is C's previous character? How?\n\nWait if the loop in Fortran is i from 2 to n (since in Java, the loop is up to n), then in Fortran's loop for i:\n\nThe indices in Java's loop ran from 2 to n \u2192 Fortran's i would be 2 to n as well.\n\nWait, variable i in Fortran's loop would correspond directly to the Java's i? Let's see.\n\nSo in Fortran's code, the loop:\n\ndo i =2, n \n\n    if ( c(i-1) == 'A' .and. c(i) == 'C' ) then\n\n    frag(i) = frag(i) +1\n\n    end if \n\n    rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i)\n\nend do \n\nWait that would correspond correctly.\n\nYes! Because for the pair of characters in 0-based Java's (i-2 and i-1) \u2192 in Fortran's 1-based, those positions are (i-1) and i.\n\nWait testing:\n\nfor i =2 in Fortran's loop (same as Java's i=2):\n\nthe positions are i-1 =1 and i=2 \u2192 which are the first two characters (Java's 0 and1), so yes.\n\nThus, the condition will be correct.\n\nWait, so the code fragment for checking fragment is:\n\nif (c(i-1) == 'A' and c(i) == 'C'), then frag(i) +=1.\n\nThen, after increasing frag's current i (the Fortran's i corresponds to the loop variable's starting at 2), then the rui is added as rui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i]\n\nIn Fortran code, the rui array is being built from 1 to n+1?\n\nWait in Java, the rui array was initialized as rui[0] =0, and for each i from 2 to n (Java), the rui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i]. \n\nBut what about the initial conditions?\n\nIn Java, the initial rui is initialized to zero (as Java arrays are zero-initialized). Thus, for i=1, rui[1] = rui[0] + frag[1]. But since frag[1] is zero (since the loop for frag starts at i=2), so rui[1] =0.\n\nrui[2] = rui[1] (0) plus frag[2], which may be 1 or 0.\n\nSimilarly, in Fortran's arrays, need to initialize them.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nallocate(frag(0:n), rui(0:n))\n\nWait but in the loops:\n\nWait code in Fortran:\n\nallocate the frag and rui arrays for (n+1) elements (indices 0 to n?), because in Java they were of size n+1 (0 to n).\n\nWait the Java code's variable is declared as: int frag[] = new int[n+1]. So array elements are from 0 to n (since indexes go 0 to n). So to map that to Fortran's arrays, they need to start at 0?\n\nAlternately, using Fortran' 1-based:\n\nSo to make arrays of size n+1 elements:\n\n allocate(frag(1:n+1), rui(1:n+1))\n\nThen, for loops:\n\nin Java code:\n\nfor (int i=2 to i<=n: )\n\nIn Fortran, for similar indexes but shifted?\n\nWait no, perhaps better to recast the code to use 1-based arrays.\n\nWait in Java:\n\nThe frag[i] increments by one if c's i-2 and i-1 chars are AC. So for i from 2 to n ( inclusively), the loop variable goes from 2 to n.\n\nIn Java, the frag is array from 0 to n. So in Fortran arrays with 1-based indexes:\n\nThe frag array is 1 to n+1 (since original array was n+1 elements).\n\nClassically, in the problem's code, the initial frag array is size n+1 (e.g. n+1 elements in Java).\n\nThe rui is such.\n\nWait, so in Fortran:\n\nallocate(frag(1:n+1), rui(1:n+1))\n\nInitialize them to 0:\n\nfrag =0 \n\nrui =0 \n\nThe initial values for frag(1) is zero, frag(2) is the first possible value.\n\nThen the loop for i from 2 to n:\n\n do i =2, n\n\n    if (c(i-1)=='A' .and. c(i) == 'C' ) then \n\n         frag(i) = frag(i) +1 \n\n    end if \n\n    rui(i) = rui( i-1 ) + frag(i)\n\n enddo \n\nWait but what about the rui(n+1) ?\n\nWait in the Java code, the loop is only up to i <=n, so for i from 2 ton, to compute the frag and rui for indices up to n. The rui is built up to the current index i, so the rui(n) has the total up to n.\n\nThe Fortran's loop is the same.\n\nBut the rui in Java has rui[n] as the total. Thus, in Fortran's arrays, the rui is built up to index n.\n\nThus, the rui array is 1 to n+1, but in the loop, rui(i) is computed only up to n (since the loop is up to i =n). So after this loop, the rui(n) has the cumulative up to then.\n\nThe code for the queries:\n\nIn the Java code, for each query, it takes the range's L and R (0-based or what?).\n\nThe range array is stored in range[i][0 and1].\n\nIn the Java code, for each query:\n\nleft = range[i][0]\n\nright = range[i][1]\n\nThen output rui[right] - rui[left].\n\nWait in the code example from before (n=4):\n\nthe first frag at 2 has 1 and frang4 has 1.\n\nrui(4) is 2. So for a query L=1 (range[0] in the first query's L), and R=2, the calculation would be:\n\nrui[2] (1) minus rui[left ] (1) \u2192 wait, wait no.\n\nWait the Java code uses rui[r] - rui[L], where the L and R are taken directly from the user's input (from the range array). The range array stores the inputs which were directly read from the user.\n\nIn the Java code, the user inputs the range as two integers per line.\n\nAssuming the input is given in a way where each pair (L, R) is 1-based indices. Then, for the query (L=1, R=2), Java's code outputs rui[right] (rui[2]) minus rui[R] is R=2, so right is 2 \u2192 rui[2] minus rui[1], which would be rui[2]=1 and rui[1] is 0; resulting in 1.\n\nYes, which matches the first pair.\n\nAssuming that in the actual code the inputs are one-based, thus in Java's code the user inputs L and R are 1-based.\n\nThus, in the code, the user's input L is stored as range[i][0], which is then stored as left=range[i][0], which are the integers provided by the user.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we need to read those elements, and then compute rui[right] - rui[left].\n\nWait, but in the Java's code's logic:\n\nrange[i][0 and1] hold the L and R values (the user's input).\n\nThe loop processes:\n\nfor each query:\n\n    left = range[i][0]\n\n    right = range[i][1]\n\n    print( rui[right] - rui[left] )\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nthe ranges are stored in a 2D array (since in Java it's a 2D array).\n\nAssuming that Fortran is also read as ranges being 1-based indices (the same as Java), so after reading into range(i,1) and range(i,2) where i runs from 1 to q.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop starts from i=1 to q.\n\nThen for each query:\n\nleft = range(i,1)\n\nright = range(i,2)\n\nprint *, rui(right) - rui(left)\n\nThus the code would work similarly.\n\nWait, but let's check with the first example:\n\nIn the first example with N=4, the query (L=1, R=2):\n\nright is 2 \u2192 the array's rui(2) is 1, rui(left) = rui(1) =0 \u2192 1-0 =1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond query for L=2 and R=4:\n\nrui(4) is 2 - rui(2)=1 \u2192 gives 1. Correct.\n\nThus the code should work as intended.\n\nNow, for the Fortran arrays sizes.\n\nBecause in Java, the frag array was size n+1 (indices 0..n). Thus in Fortran, the frag array must also have indices from 1 to n+1 (because that's how many elements it had). Wait that would be n+1 elements.\n\nWait Java's array is initialized to size n+1, so elements are [0..n]. So to match this in Fortran using 1-based arrays, the array should have 1 to n+1.\n\nThus the loop for frag is up to i<=n? Because the loop in Java for i runs up to n.\n\nYes:\n\nThe loop in Java:\n\nfor(i from 2; i<=n; i++) {\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran's array where frag's indexes are 1 to n+1, then i in the Fortran loop is from 2 to n.\n\nWait yes, that was earlier considered.\n\nThus, the code's loop does that.\n\nNow putting all together.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. declare allocatable arrays:\n\ncharacter(len=1),allocatable :: c(:)\n\ninteger,allocatable :: range(:,:), frag(:), rui(:)\n\nread n and q.\n\nallocate(c(n))\n\nallocate( range(q,2) )\n\nallocate(frag(1:n+1), rui(1:n+1) )\n\nThen read the c array:\n\nFirst, read the string.\n\nThe string can be read with read(*,*) and then split into characters.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nAfter reading n and q, allocate c(n)\n\nThen read the characters:\n\nread(*, '(a)') (c(i), i=1, n)\n\nWait no. That would require the input to be such.\n\nAlternatively, read the string into a buffer:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: str\n\nread(*,*) str \n\nBut that's after n, q are read.\n\nWait for the code:\n\nprogram atmover\n\n...\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger ::n, q, i\n\ncharacter(len=1), allocatable :: c(:)\n\ninteger, allocatable :: range (:,:), frag(:, rui(:)\n\n...\n\nread(n, q)\n\nallocate(c(n))\n\nthen read the next part.\n\nThe easiest way for reading the string as a single line is:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nwhere s is a character variable large enough to hold the string. But since s needs to be exactly n characters, perhaps read and then copy.\n\nAlternatively, using this:\n\nAfter reading the first line:\n\nFirst line has n and q. Then the second line is the string of n characters.\n\nThus:\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\n   ! Read n and q from first line:\n\n   read(*,*) n, q\n\n   ! Read the string from second line:\n\n   character(len=n) :: str\n\n   read(*, '(a)') str\n\n   ! copy to c array:\n\n   do i=1,n\n\n      c(i) = str(i:i)\n\n   end do\n\nAlternatively:\n\nIt can be done via a single read with the transfer function, perhaps? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nread(*, '(a)', advance='no') str\n\nwhere the advance='no' means that after reading the string, the next input is from the same line. But code is better as:\n\nRead the first line (n,q), then read the second line (the string):\n\nSo code as:\n\n   read(*,*) n,q\n\n   allocate(c(n))\n\n   read(*,'(a)', advance='no') str\n\n   if (len_trim(str) <n ) then \n\n      ! error ?\n\n      stop\n\n   else\n\n      do i=1,n\n\n         c(i) = str(i:i)\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\nAlternatively, just trust the problem's input.\n\nThus:\n\nread(*, '(a)') str\n\nassuming it is exactly n characters long.\n\nAssuming everything works:\n\nOnce the c array is filled, then loops:\n\n   frag =0\n\n   rui =0\n\n   do i=2, n\n\n      if ( c(i-1) == 'A' .and. c(i) == 'C' ) then\n\n         frag(i) = frag(i) +1 \n\n      end if \n\n      rui(i ) = rui(i-1) + frag(i )\n\n   end do \n\nWait but rui(1) would be rui(0) + frag(1).\n\nBut initially rui is initialized to zero, so rui(i-1) when i=2 \u2192 rui(1) is initialized to 0.\n\nWait:\n\nWait, in the Java code's initial conditions:\n\nrui[0] is 0, then for each i from 2 to n, the rui is built as rui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i].\n\nWait , the Fortran loop starts at i=2 and the first step:\n\nrui(i-1) is rui(1), which is 0, since before the loop, rui is all zero.\n\nThus yes, for fortran's rui(i) = ... \n\nWait the loop in Fortran starts with i=2 to n.\n\nThus, for i=2, the rui(2) = rui(1) (0) + frag(2).\n\nThen fragments and rui build up.\n\nOnce that's done, we read the ranges:\n\nloop over q:\n\ndo i=1, q\n\n   read(*,*) range(i,1), range(i,2)\n\nend do \n\nThen loop over the queries:\n\ndo i=1, q \n\n   left = range(i,1) \n\n   right = range(i,2)\n\n   print *, rui(right) - rui(left)\n\nend do \n\nWait, but the Java code uses the input's L and R directly. But in Fortran's case, the arrays are 1-based so it should be correct.\n\nThus, all this put together.\n\nThus, the code would look like this:\n\nWait but variable declarations must be done inside module or in the program. Also using allocatable arrays:\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe full Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, q, i, left, right\n\n   character(len=1), allocatable :: c(:)\n\n   integer, allocatable :: range(:, :), frag(:), rui(:)\n\n   ! read n and q\n\n   read(*,*) n, q\n\n   ! allocate arrays\n\n   allocate( c(n) )\n\n   allocate( range(q, 2) )\n\n   allocate( frag(n+1), rui(n+1) )\n\n   ! read the string:\n\n   character(len=n) :: str\n\n   read(*, '(a)') str\n\n   do i =1, n\n\n      c(i) = str(i:i)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! initialize frag and rui arrays to zero\n\n   frag = 0\n\n   rui = 0\n\n   ! compute frag and rui arrays\n\n   do i = 2, n\n\n      if (c(i-1) == 'A' .and. c(i) == 'C') then\n\n         frag(i) = frag(i) + 1\n\n      end if\n\n      rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! read the query ranges:\n\n   do i = 1, q\n\n      read(*,*) range(i,1), range(i,2)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! process queries:\n\n   do i =1, q\n\n      left = range(i,1)\n\n      right = range(i,2)\n\n      print*, rui(right) - rui(left)\n\n   end do\n\nend program main\n\nWait wait, but in Fortran, the range indices would be stored as 1-based, so that matches the problem's demands.\n\nWait but in the code above, the frag array is allocated as n+1 elements (array indices 1 to n+1). So rui and frag have size n+1.\n\nWait but in the loop, i is going from 2 to n (the upper limit). The rui(n) is built properly.\n\nThe queries are handled as per input.\n\nWait, but let's test the sample case again:\n\nSample input:\n\n4 1\n\nACAC\n\n1 2\n\nThen the ranges for the first query is left =1, right=2.\n\nThe frag array after the loop:\n\ni=2: c(1=\u2019A\u2019 and c(2=\u2019C\u2019) \u2192 yes \u2192 frag(2)=1 \u2192 rui(2) =0 +1=1.\n\ni=3: c(2=C and c(3=A \u2192 no\u2192 frag(3)=0 \u2192 rui(3)=1 +0=1.\n\ni=4: c(3=A and c(4)=C \u2192 yes \u2192 frag(4)=1 \u2192 rui(4) =1 (rui(3)=1) +1 \u2192 2.\n\nThus when the first query L=1,R=2 \u2192 rui[2] (1) - rui[1] (0) \u21921.\n\nWhich is correct. So this works.\n\nAnother case:\n\nquery for L=2 and R=4:\n\nrui(4)=2 - rui(2)=1 \u2192 1.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n- 1-based vs 2-based in ranges.\n\nWait in the code above, the first element of frag is at index 1, but the code's loop starts at i=2. \n\nThe frag(1) is initialized to zero.\n\nrui(1) is computed as rui(0) + frag(1). But since rui starts with all zeros, rui(0) would be undefined unless we initialized rui(0).\n\nAh! Wait a problem:\n\nThe code initializes frag and rui to zero. But in Fortran, the allocations for frag and rui are from 1 to n+1.\n\nThe initial assignment frag =0 and rui =0 sets all indices from 1 to n+1 to zero.\n\nTherefore, when the loop is i=2 to n:\n\n The first iteration (i=2):\n\n calculates rui(2) = rui(i-1) \u2192 rui(1). which is zero.\n\n But after this step:\n\n what about the rui( n+1 )?\n\n Does it matter?\n\n Because the queries will have R no more than the original n ?\n\nThe problem statement says that the queries have L <= R <=n.\n\nThus in the code, the variable i in the loop runs up to n, so the code fills up up to rui(n).\n\n But in the rui array, since in Fortran it's allocated up to n+1, and the loop's upper limit is n, the rui(n+1) remains zero.\n\n But for the problem's queries, since R <=n (1-based?), the right will be <=n so it is okay.\n\nThus the code should work.\n\nTherefore, this is the translation."
