Wait the edges are only used to compute the degrees and fill the adjacency lists. If N=1, then nodes(0) has no children (degree zero), which is handled in the existing code.

Thus:\n\nif ( N ==1 ) then \n\n    allocate( edges(0,2) )  \n\n    ! but edge loops will read nothing. But in the loop over 1 to N-1 (0 loops) it will not execute.

However in the code, since each node's pattern contribute to the product, but since the pattern is potentially K minus a non-negative number. Wait, what is pattern set to? The Java code has pattern = K - use_val. But in the code, when the K is less than use_val, then the node's pattern becomes negative, leading to a product mod 1e9+7 which would compute the proper modulo as K can't be less than the required value here? Wait in the original problem statement (from atcoder problem ABC133 E), the problem must have constraints such that K is at least the required number to make the patterns non-negative.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. It looks like a problem related to trees, maybe calculating some patterns or combinations in a tree structure. The main class is atcoder_ABC133_E, and it has a Node class. The solve method reads input, then sets up a tree structure, and finally computes some kind of pattern value modulo 1e9+7.\n\nFirst, let me parse the structure. The Node class has several fields: pattern (a long), index (int), children as a linked list of integers, and parent. The setParent method is recursive, setting the pattern and parent for each node. The children are linked lists, which in Java is dynamic. \n\nHmm, translating this into Fortran. But Fortran doesn't have classes the same way. Oh right, Fortran has modules and derived types. So probably need to represent the Node as a type. The children in each node are a list of integers. Since Fortran can have linked lists with pointers, but maybe using arrays would be easier?\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the children are stored as a LinkedList. So in Fortran, maybe we can represent that as an array of linked lists. Let me think. Alternatively, since it's a tree, perhaps the children can be represented as an adjacency list. Since each node's children are stored in a list, the Fortran equivalent might be an array where each element points to a list. But Fortran doesn't have built-in linked lists, so perhaps using dynamic arrays or a list structure with indices.\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran 2003 allows dynamic arrays with ALLOCATABLE and pointers. Maybe for each node, we can store an array of integers representing its children. Let's consider that approach.\n\nThe main steps to translate:\n\n1. The Node class should be a Fortran derived type. The fields are pattern (integer*8, since Java's long is 64 bit?), index (int), children (array of children), parent (int).\n\nBut Java's children is a linked list, which is dynamic. So in Fortran, perhaps each Node will have an array to hold the children, but since the size isn't known beforehand, maybe using an array with a fixed size or a dynamic array. Since the maximum N is probably up to some typical tree size, but without knowing, perhaps preallocate arrays, but maybe more efficient to use linked lists with pointers.\n\nWait, in Fortran 2003, we can have structures with pointers. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tree structure can be stored with adjacency lists. For example, an array of linked lists. Let me consider using an array of type for children, but perhaps the children can be stored in a list. Wait, perhaps the easiest way is to represent each node's children as a list stored in an array.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem's children are added in a way that each node's children is a list, but in Fortran, perhaps read all edges first, store adjacency lists as arrays. Let me think of structure:\n\nThe Node type in Fortran would have:\n\ntype node_type\n   integer(8) :: pattern = 0\n   integer :: index\n   integer, dimension(:), pointer :: children => null()\n   integer :: parent\nend type node_type\n\nBut for the children array of each node, each node needs an array. Alternatively, better to make an adjacency list array that is allocated per node. Hmm, that may complicate. Maybe using a dynamic size approach with allocatable arrays.\n\nAlternatively, since in Java, the nodes have children collected during the input phase, perhaps preallocate an array of nodes, each with a list of children. The children can be represented as a dynamic array, which in Fortran can be done with ALLOCATABLE arrays with pointers and reallocation maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the children can be stored as linked lists with explicit pointers. Not sure. Since Fortran 90+ allows forderived types with pointers, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem could be structured so that the children are stored in a simple array of linked lists. So first, read all edges, build an adjacency list. Each node's adjacency list is the list of connected nodes. But for the problem's logic, especially when setting parents and traversing the tree, the parent constraints and traversals need to be handled.\n\nWait, the Java code starts by initializing nodes for each index, then for each edge (a and b), it adds each others to children. So that's building an adjacency list for each node, storing all connected neighbors. \n\nIn Fortran, perhaps representing each node's children as a list (array) which can be built using an array that pointed to by pointers and allocated as needed. But for simplicity, perhaps a 2D array of fixed size isn't ideal, but the problem's constraints may allow for that? If maximum N is up to 1e5 or so, perhaps using linked lists would be better. Wait, but in coding contests, often trees can be stored as a list, but in Fortran, perhaps using an adjacency list stored in a list per node.\n\nAlternatively, maybe represent the children as a list implemented with arrays. For example, first, we read the edges, then each node has a list of children, which can be stored in an array for each node. So, perhaps in Fortran:\n\nFirst, let me think about all steps:\n\nFirst, the main variables:\n\n1. Read N and K.\n\n2. Read N-1 edges. Each edge is bidirectional. Since the tree is undirected, each node's children need to include each end. \n\n3. Build an adjacency structure for each node. So for each node, a list of connected nodes. \n\n4. The Node's setParent method is a recursive procedure that processes children, sets the pattern, and so on. But in Fortran, recursion can be done but perhaps limited stack size for large N? Wait, but in coding competitions, the problem might not expect very large trees. \n\nSo first, translate the Node class into a Fortran derived type. So:\n\ntype :: node\n    integer(8) :: pattern\n    integer :: index\n    integer, allocatable :: children(:)\n    integer :: parent\nend type node\n\nThen, the nodes array is of type node.\n\nNow, the problem is in Java, each node's children is a linked list, so the for loop in setParent runs over children in the linked list. \n\nNext, the setParent method is part of the Node. But in Fortran, functions can't be part of derived types as easy as in Java. So instead, setParent must be a subroutine that operates on nodes.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the code structure will involve:\n\n- Allocating an array of nodes.\n\n- For each node, children are stored in an array.\n\nThe main steps are: after constructing the tree (adjacency list), we start with node 0 (the root), call setParent (a subroutine) with root, K, parent (initially -1), and use, etc. But how to handle the recursion in procedures?\n\nWait, in Java's setParent method:\n\nThe method for each node starts by setting its parent, then the count variable is set based on parent presence, then the children are looped over, skipping the parent (since that's the parent node's child?), and for each other children, that child's setParent is called with current node as its parent, and count incrementally goes up.\n\nWait, in the setParent function in Java:\n\npublic void setParent(int K, int parent, int use, Node[] nodes) {\n    this.pattern = K - use;\n    this.parent = parent;\n    int count = 1;\n    if (parent != -1) {\n        count++;\n    }\n    // loop through children (children could include the parent, since it's an undirected tree)\n    // but we have to ignore the parent here\n    for (int n : children) {\n        if (n == this.parent) continue;\n        nodes[n].setParent(K, index, count, nodes);\n        count++;\n    }\n}\n\nWait the 'use' parameter starts at 0? Because when called initially for the root (node0), the call is setParent(K, -1, 0, nodes). So the initial 'use' is 0.\n\nWait, the code's logic:\n\nThe 'pattern' for the node is set to K - use. Wait, that's confusing. Let's think.\n\nThe code is for counting the number of ways to assign colors to the edges such that each node has exactly K colors selected, except when it's a leaf?\n\nWait the problem statement is not known here, but from code, perhaps the pattern represents the number of possible choices for that node's edges. So for each node, the pattern is computed and multiplied together.\n\nThe recursion sets each node's pattern based on the K, use parameter.\n\nIn any case, the translation steps are necessary.\n\nThe steps for translation:\n\nFirst, set up the node data structure in Fortran.\n\nThe first task is to represent the nodes with their properties. The children in Fortran's derived type with an allocatable array.\n\nThen, the children arrays must be filled during setup by reading all edges and adding to each node's children list.\n\nWait, in the edge reading part, for each edge a-b, each node a and b add the other to their children. So for each edge, we have two entries in each's list.\n\nBut lists can be handled via dynamic arrays. However in Fortran, handling dynamic arrays for each node's children may require pre-allocation or using an array of pointers to other arrays. Maybe a more comfortable way here is to read all edges, collect them into a big array, and then for each node, split the edges into their adjacency lists.\n\nWait alternatively, for each node, we can collect its children in a list stored in a dynamic array (allocated as needed).\n\nThe process would be:\n\nRead all edges first. Since the problem has N-1 edges:\n\nRead each a and b, and for each pair, append the edge to both nodes' list of children.\n\nBut to do this, the children array for each node must be dynamically expandable.\n\nAlternatively, for Fortran, perhaps first create an array for all edges and then for each node, collect their neighbors.\n\nWait here's an idea:\n\n- The total edges are fixed, so first read all edges into an array (Input array).\n\n- Then for each node, build its adjacency list by going through all edges and noting which edges are connected to it.\n\nBut this may be slow for large N. However, for coding competition, perhaps in some cases, doing it in a way with allocated lists for each node is manageable.\n\nFirst, as the process of reading edges, we can for each edge (a, b), add b to a's children and a to b's children. To do this in Fortran:\n\nPerhaps for each node, we can have a dynamic list stored as an array which is dynamically extended.\n\nFortran allows using allocatable arrays with reallocation, but in a subroutine, but how to handle in the context of building the adjacency lists.\n\nAlternatively, for each node's children, first store them in a vector, then allocate the array.\n\nLike:\n\ntype :: node\n    integer(8) :: pattern = 0\n    integer :: index\n    integer, allocatable :: children(:)\n    integer :: parent = -1\nend type node\n\nThen, the program initializes an array of nodes.\n\nInitially, the children array is unallocated, and when processing edges, for each node, when an edge is added, we can:\n\nCheck if the current children array is big enough. If not, reallocate and increase the size, then append.\n\nAlternatively, since it's possible to know the degree of each node (the number of edges) before allocating. The problem is that since it's a tree, each node's children count is exactly its degree. But when reading edges, the edges can be stored, then the degree can be determined per node, then the children arrays can be preallocated.\n\nAh this is better. Let me think:\n\n1. Read All edges first:\n\n   - Read N and K first as input.\n\n   - Then read N-1 edges, storing each edge as two entries (since unidirectional edges need to be considered bidirectional? Or as adjacency pairs?)\n\nWait, step 1:\n\nRead N, K.\n\nRead N-1 lines of a and b (1-based?), as in Java code - converting to 0-based (as in code: a = in.nextInt()-1; same for b).\n\nBut I'll handle that in the code.\n\nSo first, create an array to store all edges. Since there are N-1 edges, perhaps use a 2D array for edges (size (0:N-1), 2).\n\nWait:\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the variables:\n\nRead N and K.\n\nThen read N-1 edges. Each edge is a pair of integers (a, b). Convert them to zero-based.\n\nSo:\n\ntype edgeType\n   integer :: a, b\nend type edgeType\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_edges = 10**4 (or some value, but perhaps using allocate here)\n\nBut better to first read all edges into an array.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nAfter reading N, allocate the edges array with size (0:N-2), index from 0 to N-2 (since N-1 edges).\n\nWait in Fortran, array indices start at 1 unless specified. Hmm, need to manage indices properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nallocate( edges(1:N-1) )\n\nedges(i) will have a and b.\n\nOnce all edges are read, then for each node, count how many edges it has.\n\nWe can create a count array (degree array), initialized to zero. Then for each edge (a,b):\n\n   degree(a) = degree(a) + 1\n\n   degree(b) = degree(b) + 1\n\nThen for each node, we know the size of its children list. Then we can allocate the children array for each node with that size. Then, reset the counts to zero, and in another loop over edges, append the other nodes to each node's children. \n\nThat way:\n\nChildren array can be allocated exactly to the size needed without excessive resizing.\n\nYes, this is a common approach for adjacency lists in Fortran. \n\nSo, steps for building the adjacency list:\n\n1. Read N and K.\n\n2. Read edges:\n\n   dimension edges(N-1,2) or use derived type, but let's say edges are stored as 2 columns.\n\nThen:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1, 2) :: edges (assuming a and b are 0-based)\n\nWait, for Fortran, indices starting at 1, so maybe:\n\nRead into an array edges(1 to N-1, 2) with the first value stored as edges(i,1) and edges(i,2). Converting to zero-based (subtract one from the input values).\n\nSo:\n\nallocate( edges(1:N-1, 2) )\n\ndo i = 1, N-1\n\n   read *, a, b\n\n   a = a -1\n\n   b = b -1\n\n   edges(i,1) = a\n\n   edges(i,2) = b\n\nend do\n\nThen, compute the degree array:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: degree\n\ndegree = 0\n\ndo i =1, N-1\n\n   degree( edges(i,1) ) = degree( edges(i,1) ) +1\n\n   degree( edges(i,2) ) = degree( edges(i,2) ) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, create the nodes:\n\ntype(node), dimension(0:N-1) :: nodes\n\nallocate nodes. Each node's children array needs to be allocated with size degree(node's index). \n\nallocate the children arrays:\n\ndo i=0,N-1\n\n   allocate( nodes(i)%children(0:degree(i)-1 ) )\n\nend do\n\nThen, reset the degree array to 0 (to use as indexes):\n\ndegree =0\n\nThen loop again over the edges, and for each edge (a,b), add to the children arrays.\n\ndo i=1,N-1\n\n   edgea = edges(i,1)\n\n   edgeb = edges(i,2)\n\n   target_a = edgea's children\n\n   nodes(edgea)%children( degree(edgea) ) = edgeb\n\n   degree(edgea) = degree(edgea)+1\n\n   nodes(edgeb)%children( degree(edgeb) ) = edgea\n\n   degree(edgeb) = degree(edgeb)+1\n\nend do\n\nThis way, all children are correctly added. But wait, this requires the degree array being set as indices where each addition starts. Since initially the degree array was set to the count, we can use it as counters.\n\nBut we had to zero them out before the second loop. That makes sense.\n\nOkay, so the structure so far is manageable.\n\nNext is the setParent method. \n\nThe Java's setParent is a method that's applied recursively starting from the root (node 0). The parameters passed are:\n\n- K: the K from the input.\n\n- parent: the parent of the current node (initially -1 for root)\n\n- use: which the first call starts with 0.\n\nThen, this method computes the pattern, then calls for each child (excluding the parent) with new use value?\n\nWait let me re-analyze the Java method's code.\n\nInside setParent:\n\nthis.pattern = K - use;\n\nthis.parent = parent;\n\nThen initializes the count variable.\n\nHm:\n\nThe count variable starts at 1 plus parent: if parent != -1, count is 2, else 1?\n\nSpecifically:\n\n int count =1; \n\nif parent is not -1 (not root), count +=1?\n\nNo, the code does:\n\nif (parent != -1) count++;\n\nSo:\n\nstarting count =1, then if parent not -1, increment by 1. So count is 1 + (parent is present ? 1 :0 )\n\nThus count is initially 1 (no parent) or 2 (has a parent).\n\nWait, wait:\n\nJava code snippet:\n\nint count =1;\n\nif (parent != -1) count++;\n\nso after that, count is 2 if parent is set (root has parent -1, so count starts at 1, but then after the if, if root has a parent, but initially the first call is parent -1. Wait the first call is node0.setParent(K, -1,0, nodes). \n\nThus for the first step (node0):\n\ncount starts at 1, then because parent is -1, so no increment. count remains 1.\n\nWait, wait first node0:\n\ncount =1 (initial).\n\nsince parent is -1, so do not increment. count remains 1.\n\nThen loops through its children (children includes all connected nodes except the parent, but since this is the root, parent is -1, so all children are considered except none (parent is invalid). \n\nWait, the for loop: \n\nfor (int n : children) \n\n   if (n == parent) continue; \n\n   then process each child n. \n\nWait parent for root is -1, and the children contain all its neighbors. \n\nSo for root's children, the parent is -1, so none of the children equal parent, so all are processed.\n\nEach call to children[n].setParent(...) is made with parent now being root's index (0) and the count value (starting from count =1?), and the count increments as it goes.\n\nHmm, perhaps the count is the number of groups? \n\nWell, regardless, the logic is that each node's children (except its parent) are traversed, and for each child, setParent is called with current node's index as their parent, and the count increases with each step.\n\nIn the parameters:\n\nEach recursive call passes count as the new \"use\" parameter to the children? Or the first parameter is K?\n\nWait the parameters of setParent are (int K, int parent, int use, Node[] nodes). \n\nIn the first call to setParent, nodes are passed, and the parameters are:\n\nnodes[0].setParent(K, -1, 0, nodes); \n\nWait in code of the call, the parameters are:\n\n- K: the same as passed.\n\n- parent - the current node's parent (starts with -1 for root). \n\n- use: the value passed in is 'use', which in the first call is 0.\n\nThen in setParent, the node's pattern is set as K - use. \n\nThus when processing children, the next call to setParent for a child would pass the parent as the current node's index (this.index), the use parameter is count (the current count?). \n\nWait let's look:\n\nCalling for the child node 'n' in children list (excluding parent):\n\nnodes[n].setParent(K, index, count, nodes);\n\nThe third parameter passed is count. Because count increases each step. \n\nSo during the initial loop for the root (node 0), the first child is processed with count starting at 'count' =1 (since parent was -1, so init to 1), so the use parameter is count (1). \n\nThen after that, count is incremented by 1. The next child will be called with count 2, and so on. \n\nTherefore, the 'use' parameter in the parent call for the child is the current count.\n\nThus, each child is called with K, parent as the current node's index, use is the count at that step.\n\nSo the pattern is set in the child's node as K - use. \n\nAh, okay. \n\nThe importance here is that each child can thus have a different 'use' value based on their position in their parent's children list. This is likely to allow assigning colors without overlapping. \n\nIn Fortran, then, the setParent function has to be a recursive subroutine that takes as parameters the current node (indexes?), K, parent, use, and the nodes array. \n\nWait in order to handle this, perhaps in Fortran we can represent the nodes as an array, indexed from 0 to N-1, of type node.\n\nThe setParent procedure would be a recursive subroutine:\n\nsubroutine setParent( K, idx, parent_node, use_val )\n\nWait no, need parameters:\n\nPublicly, the nodes are stored as an array (nodes[0:N-1]). The setParent for a node (given its index) will need to modify its properties and then loop over its children (children list) except its parent.\n\nWait perhaps the signature of the recursive subroutine is:\n\nsubroutine set_parent( thisNode, parent_node, use_val, K )\n\nwhere:\n\n- thisNode is the current node's index (0 based).\n\n- parent_node is the index of thisNode's parent.\n\n- use_val is the \"use\" parameter.\n\n- K is the constant.\n\nThe subroutine will:\n\n1. Set thisNode's pattern to K - use_val.\n\n2. Set thisNode's parent to parent_node.\n\n3. Initialize count. Count starts at 1 plus 1 if parent is not -1?\n\nWait, following Java's approach:\n\ncount = 1 + (parent_node != -1 ? 1 : 0)\n\nWait in code:\n\ncount =1\n\nif parent != -1 then count +=1 --> so count = 2\n\nso the initial count is 1 if no parent, else 2.\n\nSo count = 1 + (parent !=-1 ? 1:0 )\n\nWait, Java code:\n\nIn the Java setParent:\n\n count =1;\n\nif (parent != -1)\n\n    count +=1;\n\nSo yes.\n\nIn Fortran's code:\n\ncount =1\n\nif (parent_node /= -1) count = count +1\n\nthen process the children.\n\nNow, the children array for thisNode is nodes( thisNode )%children(:). \n\nLoop through each child in nodes( thisNode )%children. \n\nfor each child in children:\n\n   if child == parent_node, then continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      call set_parent( child, thisNode, count, K )\n\n      count increases by 1.\n\nThus, in Fortran code, it would be a loop through all children except parent. \n\nNow, the recursive structure needs to process each child except the parent. \n\nPossible code steps:\n\nsubroutine recursive_setParent( node_index, parent, use_val, K )\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: node_index, parent, use_val, K\n\n   integer :: count, edge_linear_var, child_idx, i\n\n   nodes(node_index)%pattern = K - use_val\n\n   nodes(node_index)%parent = parent\n\n   count = 1\n\n   if ( parent /= -1 ) then \n\n      count = count + 1\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Now loop through children:\n\n   do i = 0, size( nodes(node_index)%children ) -1\n\n      child_idx = nodes(node_index)%children( i )\n\n      if( child_idx == parent ) cycle\n\n      ! Call setParent with this child, with count as the \"use\" parameter\n\n      call setParent( child_idx, node_index, count, K )\n\n      count = count +1\n\n   end do \n\nend subroutine \n\nNote that I have to adjust for indexes correctly.\n\nWait in Fortran, the children array is from 0 to degree-1? Because in the code above, the children array is allocatable and allocated with (0:degree-1). \n\nYes, when we initialized the children array, for node i with degree equal to the original count, allocated as (0: degree(i)-1).\n\nTherefore, the indices run from 0 to n-1 (for a length of n). So in the loop over children, using i=0 to upper limit (size-1).\n\nThus, that is correct.\n\nNow the initial call to setParent would be:\n\ncall setParent(0, -1, 0, K)\n\nWait wait in the first call in Java: root node (0) calls setParent with K, parent -1, use 0, and the nodes array.\n\nYes, so in Fortran, initial call would be to:\n\ncall recursive_setParent( node_index=0, parent=-1, use_val=0, K=K )\n\nThen, after that, compute the total patterns by multiplying all patterns of each node mod 1e9+7.\n\nThus, in the procedure:\n\nAfter all nodes are processed, the product is calculated:\n\npatterns = 1\n\ndo i=0 to N-1\n\n   patterns = (patterns * nodes(i)%pattern) mod mod_value\n\nend do \n\nwhere mod_value is 1e9+7.\n\nHandling the mod is important to prevent integer overflow.\n\nNow, some considerations for Fortran:\n\n- The derived type needs to be defined properly.\n\n- The recursive subroutine must be declared as recursive, and the variables like 'nodes' must be accessible in the same scope.\n\nWait, the nodes array is part of the main routine, so how will the recursive subroutine access it?\n\nIn Fortran, all the variables that need to be referenced by the recursive subroutine must either be passed as arguments or declared as GLOBAL or have module-scope. Alternatively, the subroutine can be part of a module which has access to nodes as a module variable. But in this case, since it's a code translation, perhaps the nodes array can be a local array in the main program, and the subroutine is inside the main program and has access.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the subroutines can be internal to the main program. So perhaps structure like:\n\nprogram main\n\n   use some module for types?\n\nAlternatively, since everything can be within the main program, so the code structure could be:\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, parameter :: mod_value = 1000000007\n\ntype node_type\n   integer(8) :: pattern = 0\n\n   integer :: index, parent\n\n   integer, allocatable :: children(:)\n\nend type node_type\n\nreal variables N,K\n\n   ...\n\n   declare variables here, like edges, nodes arrays.\n\n   call setParent( ... )\n\n   compute product, output.\n\ncontains\n\nrecursive subroutine recursive_setParent(...) \n\n   access to nodes / variables ?\n\nWait no, variables declared in the main program are accessible in the internal subroutines, if the subroutine is contained within the main program.\n\nSo if the subroutine is inside the contains block, then variables referenced in the main program are visible.\n\nThus, as long as the nodes array is of the scope of the main program, then in the recursive subroutine, it can reference nodes% ... as needed.\n\nWait, here's an example structure:\n\nprogram main \n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, parameter :: mod_value = 1000000007\n\n   integer :: N, K\n\n   ...\n\n   integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: edges\n\n   type( node_type ), dimension(:), allocatable :: nodes \n\n   ... ( code to read the inputs and build nodes )\n\n   call recursive_setParent( 0, -1, 0, K )\n\n   ... compute product and output ...\n\ncontains\n\nrecursive subroutine recursive_setParent( node_index, parent, use_val, K )\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: node_index, parent, use_val, K\n\n      integer :: count, ...\n\n      nodes( node_index )%pattern = K - use_val \n\n      nodes( node_index )%parent = parent \n\n      count =1 \n\n      if ( parent /= -1 ) count = count +1\n\n      do i= ... \n\n          ... \n\n      end do \n\n   end subroutine\n\nend program \n\nThus this will work because the nodes array is in the main program's scope and the subroutine is internal.\n\nThat's the correct approach.\n\nNow, let me code step by step.\n\nFirst, in the main program:\n\nStart with the declarations and parameter:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC133_E\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer, parameter       :: MOD = 1000000007\n\n    integer                  :: N, K\n    integer                  :: i, a, b\n    integer, allocatable     :: edges(:,:) \n    type(node_type), allocatable  :: nodes(:)\n    integer                  :: count, total\n    integer(8)               :: patterns = 1\n\n    ! Then, read N and K:\n\n    read *, N, K \n\n    ! Read N-1 edges. Each edges has 2 elements (a and b)\n\n    allocate( edges(0:N-2, 2) )  ! (since first edge is zero-indexed?)\n\n    do i = 0, N-2 ! because N-1 edges: from 0 to N-2\n\n        read *, a, b\n\n        a = a - 1 \n\n        b = b -1 \n\n        edges(i,1) = a \n\n        edges(i,2) = b \n\n    end do \n\nWait wait, in Fortran, array dimensions can be set with allocatable arrays. But the edges can also be stored as (N-1, 2).\n\nFor example, starting from 1 to N-1 in first dimension. Since Fortran is 1-based unless specified. Wait, perhaps better not to use zero-based for Fortran's arrays.\n\nWait, maybe better to have N edges indices from 1 to N:\n\nWait, this is a point to be careful because indexes in code may be 0-based for nodes, but Fortran uses 1-based indices. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nThe nodes have indexes from 0 to N-1 (consistent with the Java code). But the edges can be stored 1-based in Fortran's arrays but the values converted to zero-based.\n\nThus, for example:\n\nDeclare edges as (N-1,2), with indices from 1 to N-1.\n\n    Allocate(edges(1:N-1, 0:1) ) --> Wait no. Maybe edges of size (N-1, 2), columns a and b.\n\nWait perhaps it's better to use:\n\n    integer, dimension(:, :), allocatable :: edges \n\n    allocate (edges(1:N-1, 2) )\n\nThen in the reading loop:\n\n    do i=1,N-1\n\n        read *, a, b \n\n        a = a-1! converts to zero-based (0..N-1)\n\n        b = b-1 \n\n        edges(i,1)=a \n\n        edges(i,2) = b \n\n    end do \n\nThen compute the degrees:\n\nThen create degree array (zero-based nodes):\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: degree \n\ndegree = 0 \n\ndo i=1, N-1 \n\n   a = edges(i,1)\n\n   b = edges(i,2)\n\n   degree(a) = degree(a)+1 \n\n   degree(b) = degree(b)+1 \n\nend do \n\nThen allocate the nodes array:\n\nallocate( nodes(0:N-1) )\n\nallocate the children arrays for each node:\n\ndo i=0,N-1 \n\n   allocate( nodes( i )%children(0:degree(i)-1 ) )\n\nend do \n\nReset degree to zero:\n\ndegree =0 \n\nFill in the children arrays:\n\ndo i=1, N-1 \n\n    a = edges(i,1)\n\n    b = edges(i,2)\n\n    nodes(a)%children(degree(a)) = b \n\n    degree(a) = degree(a)+1 \n\n    nodes(b)%children(degree(b)) = a \n\n    degree(b) = degree(b)+1 \n\nend do \n\nThis is the adjacency list setup.\n\nNow call the recursive_setParent:\n\ncall recursive_setParent(0 , -1, 0 , K )\n\nNow compute the patterns:\n\npatterns =1 \n\ndo i=0,N-1 \n\n    patterns = mod(patterns * nodes(i)%pattern, MOD )\n\nend do \n\nPRINT *, patterns \n\nNow the recursive subroutine must be in contained \n\nThus the code so far.\n\nNow the problematic parts:\n\nIn the recursive subroutine:\n\nNotice that the nodes array is in the main program, so in the subroutine, it is accessible. \n\nNow, the type of the node must have the children array of integers.\n\nWait the node_type's parent is an integer (same as in Java, except that in Fortran it can be -1 as in Java).\n\nLooking back at the node definition:\n\ntype node_type\n\n    integer(8) :: pattern =0\n\n    integer    :: parent = -1 \n\n    integer, allocatable :: children(:)\n\n    ! No need to have index, since the array is nodes(0), nodes(1), so the index is implicit as the array position.\n\nend type node_type \n\nWait the Java nodes have an 'index field', which is the name for their position. But since in Fortran the node is located at index 0,1,..., the node's index is sufficient. So the index field is redundant since it can be inferred from the position in the array. Thus perhaps remove the index field from the Fortran node since it's not required.\n\nThus the code proceeds.\n\nNow, the recursive subroutine's code:\n\nInside the subroutine recursive_setParent:\n\nrecursive subroutine recursive_setParent(node_index, parent, use_val, K)\n\ninteger, intent(in)            :: node_index, parent, use_val, K \n\ninteger                       :: count, current_children, degree, i\n\ninteger                       :: child\n\n! Set current node's pattern and parent.\n\nnodes( node_index )%pattern = K - use_val \n\nnodes( node_index )%parent = parent \n\ncount = 1 \n\nif ( parent /= -1 ) then \n\n    count = count + 1 \n\nend if \n\n! Get the children's array for this node.\n\ncurrent_children = nodes(node_index)%children \n\ndegree = size( current_children ) \n\n! Loop over all children and process each non-parent.\n\n do i = 0, degree -1 \n\n    child = current_children( i )\n\n    if( child == parent ) cycle \n\n    call recursive_setParent( child, node_index, count, K )\n\n    count = count+1 \n\n end do \n\nend subroutine \n\nWait wait: No, it is not the best way to loop. Need to loop through each child in the children array, check if it isn't the parent, then proceed.\n\nBut in Fortran, the children array is nodes( node_index )%children, which is of size 0 to degree-1 (since the children array for each node is allocated from 0 to (degree-1).\n\nHence yes.\n\nThus, the code is as above.\n\nBut need to make sure that current_children is the array.\n\nWait in code:\n\n current_children = nodes(node_index)%children --> but this is an allocatable integer array, which cannot be assigned like that. \n\nWait, no: In Fortran you can directly reference the children array.\n\nThe code should be:\n\ndo i = lower, upper:\n\n   child = nodes(node_index)%children( i )\n\n   if( child == parent) cycle \n\n   call recursive...\n\n   count +=1 \n\nYes. Thus, the correct code would remove current_children:\n\nthen the loop is:\n\ndo i=0, size(nodes(node_index)%children) -1 \n\n    child = nodes(node_index)%children(i)\n\n    if ( child == parent ) cycle \n\n    call \n\n    increment.\n\nTherefore, the subroutine code:\n\nrecursive subroutine recursive_setParent(node_index, parent_node, use_val, Kval)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: node_index, parent_node, use_val, Kval\n\ninteger :: child, i, count, K\n\n! K is passed as Kval, use_val is the 'use'\n\nnodes(node_index)%pattern = Kval - use_val\n\nnodes(node_index)%parent = parent_node\n\ncount = 1\n\nif ( parent_node /= -1 ) then \n\n    count = count +1 \n\nend if \n\n do i = 0, size( nodes(node_index)%children ) - 1 \n\n    child = nodes(node_index)%children( i )\n\n    if ( child == parent_node) cycle \n\n    call recursive_setParent( child, node_index, count, Kval )\n\n    count = count +1 \n\n end do \n\nend subroutine \n\nWait wait, but the parameters are given the K value. So in the problem's code, K is a constant (input variable), so passing K is necessary since each recursive call must know it.\n\nWait in Java, the K is the input's value for the entire function. \n\nIn the code, the setParent method's first parameter is the K, which is the input's K. So in the first call, it starts with the K value.\n\nBut in the subroutine's call, the fourth argument is Kval (input variable).\n\nWait in the main program:\n\n K is a variable read from the input. So when calling the initial call, the Kval is the current K variable.\n\nYes, that is correct.\n\nThus the code is okay.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about if N=1 (only a single node)?\n\nIn that case, since N-1 edges is 0 edges. The code reads edges array but N-1 is zero. \n\nThus we need to handle that. But in the code where the edges are read with a loop from i=1 to N-1, but if N-1=0, that loop will not execute. \n\nThus, in the code, the allocation for edges is to (1:N-1, 2). \n\nIf N=1, N-1 is zero, thus edges can't be allocated. So we have to handle this.\n\nAh, that's a problem.\n\nNeed to add a special case for N=1.\n\nIn the code, the edges are read N-1 times, which when N=1 would be zero loops, thus no edges, so the code would not do.\n\nThe node 0 would be the only node.\n\nThen, the code:\n\ncall recursive_setParent(0, -1, 0, K )\n\nNow, the children array for node 0 is allocated to degree(0) which is zero. So size(nodes(0)%children) is zero.\n\nThus in the routine:\n\nloop over i from 0 to -1 (since size=0: 0-1 =-1) so loop doesn't execute. \n\nThus the child loop won't run. \n\nThe pattern for node 0 is K - 0 (because use_val was 0), so pattern is K.\n\nThen the total patterns is 1 * K mod mod. So when N=1 and K is say 5, answer is 5, which is correct.\n\nBut how is the edges array handled.\n\nIf N=1, allocate edges as:\n\nallocate(edges(1:N-1,...) --> edges(0,:), which may have issues in Fortran. Because array lower bound is 1, N-1=0 can't be allocated. \n\nThus, must first handle this case when reading the edges:\n\nBefore allocating the edges:\n\nif (N == 1) then \n\n    ! there are no edges. So edges can remain unused. \n\n    allocate(edges(0,0) ) or any dummy allocation? Or edge reading skipped.\n\n    Else, when N>1:\n\n    allocate(...)\n\nThus need to do that.\n\nThus adding an if block:\n\nif ( N ==1 ) then \n\n    ! no edges. So edges array not needed. \n\n    edges is not needed, but perhaps how the code will handle?\n\nWait the edges are only used to compute the degrees and fill the adjacency lists. If N=1, then nodes(0) has no children (degree zero), which is handled in the existing code.\n\nThus the edges can be handled with: \n\nallocate edges only when N>1.\n\nElse for N=1:\n\n   allocate dummy edges array.\n\nAlternatively, handle N=1.\n\nThus:\n\nif ( N ==1 ) then \n\n    allocate( edges(0,2) )  \n\n    ! but edge loops will read nothing.\n\nBut in the loop over 1 to N-1 (0 loops) it will not execute.\n\nAlternatively, set N=1, and the edges are not read.\n\nThus, I will add a conditional:\n\nif ( N ==1 ) then \n\n    ! set edges with 0\n\n   else \n\n    allocate edges and read \n\nend if \n\nSo in code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC133_E\n\n    ...\n\n    read *, N, K \n\n    allocate( nodes(0:N-1) )\n\n    ... \n\n    allocate and read edges:\n\n    if ( N ==1 ) then \n\n       allocate( edges(0,2) ) \n\n    else \n\n       allocate(edges(1:N-1, 2) )\n\n       do i=1,N-1\n\n           ... \n\n       end do \n\n    end if \n\nBut in Fortran, allocatable arrays can have non-zero lower bounds, but it's more straightforward to set the edges to be allocated only when N>1. \n\nActually, in Fortran, the allocation can have lower bound but in code:\n\nAlternatively, just handle N=1 as a separate case.\n\nPerhaps better to handle N=1 before proceeding further. \n\nBefore entering the code for edges, check if N is 1:\n\nif ( N ==1 ) then \n\n   ! handle single node case.\n\n   ! nodes(0)%children is allocated with size 0.\n\n   ! compute pattern:\n\n   nodes(0)%pattern = K \n\n   patterns = K mod MOD \n\n   print *, patterns \n\n    return \n\nend if \n\nThis will avoid issues with edge allocation and processing for N=1. \n\nBecause the earlier steps would be needed only when N>1. \n\nThus, in the beginning:\n\nprogram ... \n\nafter reading N and K:\n\n   if (N ==1) then \n\n       nodes(0)%pattern = K \n\n       print *, K \n\n       return \n\n    end if \n\n    proceed with normal case.\n\nThis is better, avoids array allocation problems.\n\nThus, that is incorporated. \n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nNow, the code would:\n\n- Check N=1, return K\n\n- else read edges, build adjacency lists.\n\nWait but after N is read, the node array must still be allocated.\n\nThus:\n\n   allocate(nodes(0:N-1))\n\nis before handling N=1.\n\nWait:\n\nbetter structure:\n\nafter reading N and K:\n\n! Initialize nodes array \n\nallocate( nodes(0:N-1) )\n\nthen check if N==1: do all needed and return.\n\nNow with this steps.\n\nFinal steps:\n\nNow the full code would be:\n\nPutting it all together in Fortran. \n\nSome final points:\n\nThe product must be computed correctly. Since each node's pattern is an integer(8). \n\nBecause in the Java code the pattern is long (64-bit integer), so in Fortran, the patterns are declared as integer(8).\n\nThus, the product can be up to (some big value)^N but mod 1e9+7 which fits in 64 bits.\n\nThus, the code is almost there.\n\nSo, the full code would look something like this.\n\nTesting for example, let's imagine an input of N=2, K=2, edges 1-2. \n\nBut converted to zero-based: the edge is between a=0 and b=1. \n\nThe code would:\n\nnodes(0) has children array with size 1 (since degree(0)=1, degree(1)=1)\n\nThe first call is recursive_setParent(0, -1, 0, 2).\n\nThe node's pattern would be 2-0=2\n\nThe count is initialized to 1 (parent is -1).\n\nThe children array for node 0: [1]. \n\nLoop through index 0:\n\nchild is 1. \n\nSet:\n\ncalling recursive_setParent(1, 0, 1, 2). \n\nInside this:\n\nthe pattern is 2-1=1. \n\nthe parent is 0.\n\nThe count starts as 1 +1 (because parent is not -1).\n\n count =2 \n\nthe children array for node 1 is degree 1: the children[0] is 0, but parent was 0. \n\nThus, the loop over children for node 1:\n\n the children array is [0].\n\n but parent is 0. \n\n when checking if child ==0: yes, so skip. \n\n thus the count remains. \n\n no calls are made. \n\n thus node 1's pattern is 1. \n\ntotal product is 2*1 = 2 mod 1e9+7 =2.\n\nThus that is correct?\n\nThe problem might require that the first child's use_val is 1. In the case above, for node 0:\n\ncount starts at 1.\n\n the first child is node 1, so the parameter use_val to child (node1's set_parent() is count =1 (passed as third argument).\n\nYes. Thus, that's correct. \n\nThe final pattern is 2 * 1 = 2. \n\nWhich is correct per the code.\n\nThus I think the code is correct.\n\nFinal note:\n\nThe edges array is allocated even when N=2:\n\nYes.\n\nNow, recapping all steps, the code should be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC133_E\n\n    implicit none \n\n    integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\n    integer :: N, K, i, a, b \n\n    type node_type \n        integer(8)  :: pattern = 0 \n        integer     :: parent = -1 \n        integer, allocatable :: children(:)\n    end type node_type \n\n    type(node_type), dimension(:), allocatable :: nodes \n\n    integer, dimension(:, :), allocatable :: edges \n    integer(8) :: patterns = 1 \n\n    !

The mod function is applied each time to keep it within MOD:\n\nIn Fortran, modular arithmetic can be expressed with the MOD function, but need to ensure that the negative values are handled correctly. However in the code, since each node's pattern contribute to the product, but since the pattern is potentially K minus a non-negative number.\n\nWait, what is pattern set to? The Java code has pattern = K - use_val. \n\nBut in the code, when the K is less than use_val, then the node's pattern becomes negative, leading to a product mod 1e9+7 which would compute the proper modulo as K can't be less than the required value here?\n\nWait in the original problem statement (from atcoder problem ABC133 E), the problem must have constraints such that K is at least the required number to make the patterns non-negative. Otherwise, the problem probably specifies to return 0 when K is not sufficient.\n\nBut since the code here performs K use_val subtraction, the pattern could be zero or negative. If any node has pattern zero, the whole product becomes zero ( mod MOD). If any pattern is negative, it should be incorrect. \n\nHowever in the problem setting\uff0c the solution here must require that the answer would not have K < required minimum. \n\nAssume that the original problem's constraints ensure K is large enough that every node's required pattern is non-negative, so the code here doesn't need to handle that. \n\nThus, the code constraints are correct.\n\nIn the Fortran code, when multiplying the patterns mod MOD, negative values would result from negative patterns, but modulo a positive modulus (1e9+7) can resolve that by adding MOD until ++0 mod MOD.\n\nWait in Fortran's MOD function: MOD(a, b) is the remainder after division, and for negative a, it wraps around. \n\nTo prevent negative numbers, perhaps patterns can be as ( (a%mod) + mod ) % mod but perhaps in the code, patterns * nodes(i)%pattern can be negative? \n\nDue to the pattern being K -use_val, which can be negative. \n\nThus in this code, that could lead to a negative product. To fix that, the pattern should be MOD before multiplying? \n\nWait no. For example, if pattern is K - use_val must be non-negative. If in the problem's constraints K must be \u2265 the number required. \n\nThe problem must impose that K \u2265 the number of edges emitted from each node (or whatever). \n\nBecause in the original problem (assuming it's from an actual contest), all tests would satisfy this. \n\nHence, perhaps the code is okay.\n\nThus, conclusion: the provided Fortran code above is the correct translation."
