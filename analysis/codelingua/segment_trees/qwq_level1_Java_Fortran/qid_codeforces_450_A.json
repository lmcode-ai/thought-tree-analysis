    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. From what I see, the main function reads two integers, n and m. Then it initializes two queues, q1 and q2. The first loop adds n elements to q1 from user input and adds numbers from 1 to n to q2. \n\nThen there's a loop that continues until q1 is empty. In each iteration, if the front element of q1 is less than or equal to m, it removes both elements from q1 and q2, and stores the popped element from q2 into ans. If the front element is greater than m, it subtracts m from it and adds it back to q1, and moves the corresponding q2 element to the end as well.\n\nThe final answer is the value of ans when the loop ends, which is printed out. \n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Hmm, Fortran doesn't have built-in linked lists or queues like Java. I'll need to implement queues using arrays or some other structure. Wait, since Fortran 2003 allows derived types and modules for more complex structures, but maybe the user expects a straightforward array-based approach, possibly assuming Fortran 90 or similar.\n\nLet me think step by step. \n\nFirst, variables:\nIn Java, they use two queues. Let's represent these as arrays (since sizes are known up to n, which is read at the start). Since the queues can have elements being removed and added again (like when a task is added back after reduction), we might need dynamic arrays, but Fortran arrays are static. Wait, but n is given first, so the maximum possible size the queues would reach is n plus any added elements. Hmm, maybe n is sufficient? Let me check the logic.\n\nLooking at the code, the initial size of each queue is n elements. But when an element is larger than m, it's popped, subtract m, and pushed back. So each time it's pushed back, the total number remains n? Wait, because each time you remove one and add one, the size stays the same. So the queues always stay at size n? Or wait, maybe not? Let me think.\n\nWait, in the loop:\n\n- If the element is <=m, it is removed from both queues, so the queues shrink by 1 each.\n- Else, the element x is popped, subtract m, added back to q1, and the q2's element is also moved back. So the size remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the size of the queue decreases in each iteration only when the element is taken off. But the loop runs until q1 is empty. The idea is that the program keeps processing elements until it removes an element where x <=m. The last element processed before q1 is emptied is stored as ans.\n\nHmm, so the queues might decrease in size over time but eventually when q1 becomes empty, we output ans.\n\nWait, but how does the loop terminate? Let me think of an example. Suppose all elements are larger than m. Wait, that can't be because you can always subtract m each time until it's <=m. Wait, if m is zero, then this would be a problem, but the code probably expects m to be positive. But given the problem's context, perhaps it's okay. Let's assume valid inputs.\n\nSo, for the queues, since their size can vary but never exceeds n (since after each operation, the size remains the same if element is pushed back, or decreases by 1 when removed). So a fixed size array with size n should be enough, but we need to track the current elements. \n\nIn Fortran, queues can be implemented using arrays with indices to track the front and back. Since arrays can be cumbersome, perhaps we can use circular buffers. Alternatively, since queues are FIFO, perhaps using an array and a pointer for the head and tail.\n\nLet me plan the queues as arrays, with pointers to the head and tail. So, for each queue (q1 and q2):\n\nEach has an array of size n, head and tail indices. Initially, the head starts at 1 and tail at the initial size.\n\nWait actually, let's think about queue operations in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively maybe using linked lists, but that's complicated in Fortran.\n\nAnother way is to use two arrays, say q1_arr and q2_arr. Also have pointers to track the start and end. So, maybe the variables head and tail for each queue. Let's think of queues as arrays with enqueue and dequeue operations manually handled.\n\nSo first, variables needed:\n\n- n and m as integers.\n\n- For each queue, arrays q1_data (size n), q2_data (size n). Also variables for the head and tail pointers, maybe.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to represent the queues as arrays with an array index representing the elements in the queue in order, and a count of current elements. Since in Java, the queues can grow and shrink, but in our case, as discussed, their sizes can vary but never exceed n. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a circular buffer approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of queues implemented with arrays and a pointer for the next position. Let me think step by step:\n\nInitialize two arrays of size n, say queues for numbers and their indices. Since the maximum elements would be n, but during processing they can get dequeued and enqueued again.\n\nWait maybe for each queue, the elements are stored in an array, and we have another index to track the available spots. Hmm, this might be similar to an array-based queue with front and rear pointers.\n\nYes. Here's a plan for the data structures:\n\nEach queue (q1 and q2) can be implemented as an array of size n (since the maximum elements any queue will have is n; for q1, after initial load, it can't grow beyond that, since whenever you pop and push back, it stays the same, but only shrinks when element is taken).\n\nWait the second queue (q2) has to track the positions. So when you process an element of q1, the corresponding element in q2 is its position. So, the arrays for q1 and q2 must be in sync in elements. So each entry in q1 and q2 arrays must track an associated pair (the value and the position). \n\nBut in the Java code, each queue holds those elements. So for queue 1: the initial value from user input, queue2: the initial number 1..n.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nDefine two arrays, say q1 and pos (since the second queue is the position). Each has a current size. But since queues can be circular.\n\nAlternatively, use a structure for each queue.\n\nAlternatively, since the operations are FIFO, perhaps have arrays of size n, and variables front and back pointing to the next element positions. Since we won't know the exact count, but the maximum number of elements can't exceed n.\n\nWait, here's an approximate way:\n\nWe'll initialize q1 and q2 arrays of size N, since N is the maximum number of elements they can have at any time (since they start with N elements and only can get smaller or same.)\n\nLet me think of their operations:\n\nInitialization:\n\nfront1 and back1 are pointers for q1. Initially, after pushing all elements from 1 to n, front1 = 1, back1 = n. The array is filled, but for a queue, enqueuing would require incrementing back (mod n?), but since we canrew from front.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model the queues as a circular buffer but with separate head and tail pointers, and a count of elements. But in this case, since N is known, we can have a linear approach.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use a simpler structure. Let me see:\n\nLet me first handle the input phase. In Java code, for i from 1 to n, the next integer is added to q1 and i to q2.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nDim q_ar as array of integers with size n: read from 1 to n.\n\nWait but in the code, the queues are initially filled with these numbers and the positions. So, perhaps in Fortran, the arrays for q1 and q2 are 1-based arrays consisting of the initial values. Then, during processing, we rotate or process elements from the front.\n\nBut having queues implemented with arrays could be done by maintaining front and rear indices.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem can be modeled by processing elements in order with a pointer that increments, but once you come to the end, you loop back to the start.\n\nWait perhaps the easiest way is to use a variable to track the next element to process, and after processing, move to the next, but if an element is to be added back, we can append it to the end of the array. This might work with a dynamic queue approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me model the queue data as a simple array. Let's suppose we have two arrays for the values (numbers and positions) and a count.\n\nWhen the queue is initialized:\n\ncount is set to n. The front pointer is 1. For example, when you poll, you pop the first element (front=1), then advance front to 2, decrement count. When you need to add, append to the end (count +=1), set the element at count to new value. But in queues, adding is to the end, and removing from the front.\n\nSo here's a way:\n\nImplement a queue as an array with count (or something) pointing to the current front and the size.\n\nWait let's try:\n\nDefine arrays for the numbers (q1_vals) and the positions (q2_vals), each of size n.\n\nAlso have two variables front_q1 and size_q1, similarly for the others.\n\nWait maybe per queue, have front, rear pointers, and size.\n\nWait in Fortran, here's how I can code queues:\n\nLet me define for each queue (q1 and q2):\n\nFor q1:\n\n- An array val_q1 of size n.\n\n- Variables front_q1 and rear_q1, which are integers, indicating the front and rear positions. Also keep track of the current size.\n\nAlternatively, here is an approach with a singly linked list, but that's too complex.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues are used in a manner where elements can be removed from the front and added to the back, which is the case when the number is greater than m, we can model the queue as an array with a pointer indicating the current position, but since adding back would require inserting at the end?\n\nHmm, maybe it's manageable with circular buffers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way for simplicity is to use a list that we can manipulate by swapping elements. Let's think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, we can use integer arrays for q1 and q2 and track the front and the number of elements remaining. The queues are processed as follows:\n\nInitially, the elements are stored in the front part of the array. The 'front' is the index of the first element. When we poll, we take that element and then shift the array forward.\n\nBut shifting large arrays in loops can be time-consuming, but with small constraints (maybe n up to some limit like 1e5?), but for code submission, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's constraints might be small, or since it's CF problem (450A), which is likely to have n up to 1e3 or so, so this method is feasible.\n\nHmm, but the Java code uses a linked list (Linked List implementation of Queue is O(1) for all operations). In Fortran, perhaps shifting arrays each time could be O(n), but with n up to say 1e5, it might be slow. But maybe for code translation purposes, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, can we represent the queues using pointers (like indexes) and process them without shifting?\n\nLet me try to think again of front and rear pointers for each queue, with a variable for size.\n\nLet me proceed step by step:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read n numbers into an array, and initial position array 1..n.\n\n3. Initialize queues q1 and q2. Each queue is an array and has front, rear pointers, count, direction?\n\nHmm, here's a typical queue structure:\n\nQueue has:\n\n- An array of size N.\n\n- front element index (the next to be removed is at front)\n\n- rear element index (where the next element is added)\n\n- the count of total elements.\n\nWhen we add an element, we set array[rear] = value, then rear = next position.\n\nWhen removing, take array[front], then front = next.\n\nFor a circular queue, the positions are modulo array size, but this makes it possible to have rear catch up with front, but here since the array size is equal to initial n and can't exceed, maybe a non-circular is better since the maximum count is n.\n\nFor the first queue q1:\n\nInitialize front_q1 = 0, rear_q1 = n. Wait maybe initializing array elements from 1 to n, but that can be done during input.\n\nWait, code steps in Java:\n\nInitially, the queue starts with first element at 0 (or 1?) in start.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nfor i=1 to n:\n\n   q1.add(...) so the first element is at array[0], etc. but assuming arrays are 0-based in Java.\n\nWait Java's List uses 0-based, but in Fortran arrays start at 1 by default unless specified.\n\nWait maybe in Fortran, it's easier to use arrays from 1 to n.\n\nSo let me think of each queue's array is of size n, with:\n\nfront start at 1, rear at n. The initial elements are stored from 1 to n.\n\nWait, no. Let me first, when initializing, for i from 1 to n, read value v, then add it to the queue. So for the array, the first item to dequeue is at position1, and so on.\n\nSuppose the queues are implemented as arrays with front and rear pointers as follows:\n\nInitialize q1_val array with values from the input. For the first queue, the front is the beginning (1), and the next item to remove is first in.\n\nWait, I think the approach for queues implemented as arrays with front and rear pointers:\n\nInitialize the front (points to the next element to dequeue) and rear (points to the position to enqueue).\n\nInitially, after adding elements 1 to n, front is 1, rear is n+1? Not sure.\n\nWait, let me define for each queue:\n\n- An array of integers, size n.\n\n- front and rear integer variables, starting at 1 and 1 respectively. Initially, when we add the first element, set rear to increment.\n\nWait maybe a better way:\n\nVariables for q1:\n\narray_q1(1..n),\n\nfront_q1, rear_q1.\n\nInitially, first element is stored in position 1. To add next elements, move rear_q1 forward.\n\nWait let's see.\n\nInitialization steps for queues:\n\nAfter reading n and m, read the n integers into an array (say in values), and store the initial positions (1..n) in another array (positions).\n\nNow, the initial queues are these arrays, but as queues, their elements are the first element first, etc.\n\nSo for the Java version, when they use poll(), it removes the first element.\n\nThus in the Fortran version, the queue q1's front starts at 1 and when elements are popped, front is incremented. \n\nBut when elements are added back, such as in the else part (when q1's peek() > m), then we pop the first element (front=1), subtract m, and push back into the end of the queue.\n\nPushing back would mean adding at rear_q1+1? So for the queue data:\n\nfront_q1 starts at 1, and rear_q1 starts at n, but perhaps starts at 0?\n\nAlternatively:\n\nLet me think of the queue1 array as initially filled with the values, but front is 1, and the queue is full. So when we emit elements, front moves ahead.\n\nWait perhaps the mistake here is overcomplicating.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nUse two arrays for q1 and q2 (each holds the elements). The queues are first-in first-out, so when an element is retrieved (poll), it's removed from the front.\n\nBecause in Fortran arrays, I can't easily remove an element from the front, maybe instead model the queues as arrays and use a pointer to indicate the current front position. The rest of the array is considered available when we add back.\n\nWait here's a plan:\n\n- arrays q1 (size n) and pos (size n; corresponding to the second queue's elements).\n\nEach time we dequeue, just take the first element.\n\nWait, but when adding an element back to the end of the queue, we can append it at the end of the array, growing the queue length.\n\nWait no, but the maximum required is not larger than initial n.\n\nWait here's the idea:\n\nInitially, the queues have elements 1 -n in some arrays (q1 and pos_q2).\n\nThe queue length starts at n.\n\nAs long as queue length >0\n\nThen, in each step:\n\nFirst, the front element is the first element of the arrays (index 1).\n\nIf that element <= m:\n\n    - remove it (decrement the length, and shift the array elements left by one from index 2 to last?)\n\n    - same for pos_q2 array (or pos array containing the positions) \n\n    - store the pos array's element you took as ans.\n\nElse: \n\n    subtract m from the value, add that back to the end of the q1 array (shifting other elements?)\n\n    move the corresponding pos array element to the end.\n\nBut shiifiting elements every time would be tedious in a loop, especially for large n, but maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps track the current count of elements and the front. Let's see.\n\nWait, to help me think, perhaps the variables:\n\nq1(1:n) and q2(1:n) arrays.\n\ncurrent_length1 = n (coz initially n elements)\n\nfront_idx1 = 1 (the current first element is at q1(front_idx1))\n\nWhen we poll (the first case):\n\n     if q1(front_idx1) <=m:\n\n        we take it and the ans is q2(front_idx1)\n\n        then, we can just move the front index forward (front_idx1 +=1, and decrease current_length1 by 1)\n\n        but also need to decrement to remove it from pos array (q2 array). So:\n\n     else:\n\n            take the value, subtract m, and then append (or set) at the end of the queue.\n\n            To append:\n\n            because the length is current_length1:\n\n            we set index1 = q1(front_idx1) is popped (so subtract and new value is new_val)\n\n            new_val = q1(front_idx1) -m\n\n            then, the new_val is placed in the end (where?)\n\n            The current end is front_idx1 + current_length -1, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the arrays need to be kept in FIFO order, maybe use a deque approach with front and current_length variables:\n\nLet's track for each queue:\n\n- pointer to first element: front1\n\n- current_length of the queue.\n\nWhen we want to poll the first element:\n\ncurrent_val = q1(front1)\n\nif val <=m:\n\nthen, front1 +=1 \u2192 this removes the element (since now the next first element is at front1+1?)\n\nso current_length1 decreases by 1.\n\nthe answer is the q2(front1 -1) \u2192 because we just took q2(front1-1's element? or q2(front1).\n\nWait maybe need to track q2 as another array, which is being processed in the same order as q1's, so each element in q_pair(number,position) is mapped.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to keep the sample approach with two separate arrays: one for the numbers and one for their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, use a structure (within Fortran arrays) of two parallel arrays: number and pos.\n\nSo for the queues, the current elements are from front1 to front1 + current_length -1 ?\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to use array indices with front moving forward, treating the queue as a cyclic array.\n\nAlternatively, to model the queues as their elements are stored in the arrays between the front and last (front + current_length -1). When they reach the end of the array, circularly.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's keep with non-circular. Since the maximum number of elements in any queue is n, and the queues start at size n.\n\nWait, in the first case where an element is taken off (when it is <=m), the front index increases, so the current_length decreases but the rear is unattended.\n\nAlternatively, think that the queue has a front and a length.\n\nThen, when the front reaches n+1 - length, etc.\n\nPerhaps I need to write the steps for the queues.\n\nLet me try to outline the code steps in Fortran:\n\nFirst, the input:\n\nRead n, m. Then read n integers into an array called val (size n)\n\nRead n values into val(1), val(2), ..., val(n).\n\nThen, the second queue (q2 in Java) corresponds to the indices 1..n, which are initially stored as a separate array called pos.\n\nSo, for positions(pos(1)=1, pos(2)=2, ..., pos(n)=n)\n\nNow, in each iteration of the loop while the current_length (initially n) >0:\n\n- get the first element of q1 and pos. The first element is at front1 position.\n\nSo current_number = val(front1)\n\ncurrent_pos = pos(front1)\n\nIf current_number <=m:\n\n    ans = current_pos\n\n    Move the front1 to next (front1 +=1)\n\n    Reduce current_length by 1.\n\n    Once queue is emptied (current_length becomes 0), exit loop.\n\nElse:\n\n    new_value = current_number -m\n\n    //We have to remove current element (front1), and add new_value at end of queue q1\n\n    //Also, pos element (current_pos) has to move to the end of the pos array.\n\n    To add to end of the queues:\n\n    // Since the current queues are from front1 to front1 + current_length -1\n\n    // to add new_value to the end, that is the rear.\n\n    // but how?\n\n    // The current_length remains same.\n\n    So the new element's position in val array is rear = front1 + current_length -1 \n\n    (Wait, no, if current_length is N initially, and we are at front1 = 1, the current element is front1. The length is current_length (starting at n).\n\n Wait, perhaps the next thing to do is:\n\n Original front1 and pos are current values.\n\n We can remove front1, which is the first of q1.\n\n So after removing, the next items are now from front1+1, but also the new element is added at the end. So to do that without shifting the entire array, we need an open position at the end of the array where the added element can be placed.\n\n But with arrays, maybe we can keep track of the current_length, and after removing the front element, we can replace the front element with the new element, and move all elements except the first to the previous positions? Hmm, no, that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the queues are stored in the val and pos arrays, and the valid elements are between front and (front + current_length -1) modulo the array size? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach where each time you dequeue an element, its position is replaced with the last element and shrink the array. But this would require moving elements only for the dequeue cases. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cleanest approach even with O(n) shifts:\n\nEach time a front element is popped and needs to be pushed back, we can shift all elements left by one (excluding the first element?), and append the new value at the end.\n\nWait that sounds computationally heavy for large n. But perhaps for the problem requirements, it's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps with this method.\n\nWe'll have arrays val and pos of size n. The queue has front index (always 1) and a length.\n\nWait let's reset my thinking:\n\nLet me model the queues as follow:\n\nThe elements of q1 are stored in val(1), val(2), ..., val(k) where k is current_length.\n\nLikewise, pos(1) to pos(k) are their associated positions.\n\nIf we dequeue (poll), then the first element (val(1)) is removed. If it's a \"save\" (i.e., the condition where it's taken out to compute ans), then we shift all elements left (decrementing the array indices from 2 to k), to make val(1) = val(2), etc., and k decreases by 1.\n\nHowever, if we have to push it back, then we subtract m, then the first element is removed and the new value is appended to val at the end (k+1), then k remains the same (since we removed and added back one). The pos array is similar.\n\nTherefore, the process would be:\n\nMain loop:\n\nwhile current_length >0\n\n    c_num = val(1)\n\n    c_pos = pos(1)\n\n    if c_num <=m:\n\n        ans = c_pos\n\n        // remove this element from val and pos arrays:\n\n        // shift left for all elements except first.\n\n        current_length = current_length -1\n\n        DO i = 1, current_length\n\n            val(i) = val(i+1)\n\n            pos(i) = pos(i+1)\n\n        ENDDO\n\n    else:\n\n        new_val = c_num -m\n\n        // remove first element and push into the end.\n\n        // So we shift left except first (which is now gone)\n\n        current_length remains the same.\n\n        // shift elements 2 to k to 1 to k-1\n\n        // Then we need to append new_val at position k.\n\n        temp_val = new_val \n\n        temp_pos = c_pos\n\n        DO i = 2, current_length+1  \u2192 wait, not sure.\n\n        Hmm, maybe:\n\n        first, we can capture the values to push, then shift the elements.\n\n        // remove the first element, shift the rest to the left.\n\n        DO i = 1, current_length -1\n\n            val(i) = val(i+1)\n\n            pos(i) = pos(i+1)\n\n        ENDDO\n\n        // now val(1..k-1) are the old 2..k-1, and the last (position k) is empty?\n\n        Wait, the current_length is initially say N, after the shift, the current_length = N (same as before), so to add new_val, we can then:\n\n        val(current_length) = temp_val \n\n        pos(current_length) = c_pos\n\n        current_length stays the same.\n\n       // Wait initial current_length= say L. After the shift above, the val(1..L-1) are filled, and then to add temp to L, not?\n\n       Wait maybe:\n\n       temp_val = val(1) -m \n\n       // step to remove first element (val(1) and pos(1) is stored in temp_val and cpos?\n\n       // wait in else condition.\n\n       Yes. Let me reorganize the else part:\n\n       1. save the current first element (c_num = val(1), c_pos=pos(1))\n\n       2. new_val = c_num - m\n\n       3. then shift val elements to left from pos 1 to L-1 (overwriting the first element, but maybe that's okay since we'll add new_val to the end.\n\n       So:\n\n          ! shift left (losing the first element)\n\n          DO i = 1 to current_length-1:\n\n              val(i) =val(i+1)\n\n              pos(i) = pos(i+1)\n\n          END DO\n\n          ! then append new_val and c_pos to the end?\n\n          val(current_length) = new_val \n\n          pos(current_length)= c_pos \n\n    end if \n\nWait but when you shift left, the elements from 2 to L become elements 1 to L-1, then the new value is placed at position L?\n\nWhich would effectively push it to the end of the array which is the end of the queue. That way the queue is maintained in FIFO order.\n\nSo for example:\n\nOriginal queue [a,b,c,d] with length 4\n\nAfter doing else on a (since a> m):\n\nshift left becomes [b,c,d], then appending (a -m) to pos4 gives [b,c,d, (a- m)] \u2192 so the new first element is b, and the last is the (a-m).\n\nWait, yes, this way the element is removed from the front (a), processed, and places back at end.\n\nThus this would correctly handle the push.\n\nThe initial queue length is same (4 in this example), so after shift+append, length remains 4. Because:\n\nAfter shifting, the first elements are b,c,d, and then adding the new_val (d and new_val forming part of the new array).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ncurrent_length is initially 4,\n\nafter the shift loop (i from 1 to 3):\n\nelements become val(1)=b, val(2)=c, val(3)=d.\n\nthe 4th position (val(4)) is still whatever, but after that:\n\nval(4) = new_val.\n\nSo the final array is [b,c,d, (new_val)], and the current_length is still 4.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo that method would work for both operations.\n\nThe only downside is that each time you do an operation (whether condition case or else), when you have to shift the array elements, it takes O(current_length) steps.\n\nWhich could be O(n^2) if the else loop is repeated many times, but since each time you process a queue element, you subtract m from it and push it back, and the numbers are eventually reduced, the numbers will decrease until they are below m, so probably O(n*m) time? But maybe that's manageable given the constraints.\n\nBut perhaps in most problem cases, it would be ok.\n\nAnyway, this seems manageable. Now, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, declare the variables.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nWe need to read n and m first.\n\nThen read n integers into the val array.\n\nSimilarly, the pos array is 1 to n.\n\nInitial current_length is n.\n\nfront is not needed in this approach: the array elements are shifted, and the current_length tracks the number of elements.\n\nThen the loop while current_length >0.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nThe first element is val(1), pos(1).\n\nIf val(1) <= m:\n\nWe save pos(1) in ans, reduce current_length and shift the elements left.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute new_val, shift elements left, set the last element's value and pos to new_val and pos(1), then current_length remains same.\n\nRepeat until queue is empty (current_length becomes zero). Then print ans.\n\nWait but in the first scenario, after we process an element <= m, the current_length is reduced by one, so that's our answer?\n\nOnce the loop terminates, we have ans set, and print that.\n\nYes, because once that element is processed, we exit the loop.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop continues until q1 is empty, so in this Fortran approach when processing the case where the first element is taken (<=m):\n\nWe take it, record its position into ans, then the next iteraion of the while loop would check if current_length is>0. Since it was reduced to current_length-1 which is >=0 (since initial current_length is n?), so after that it will keep running.\n\nWait the loop ends only when current_length is zero. So when we process a value and take the 'ans', we need to let the loop continue until current_length is zero? Or in the following step we will have the ans yet. Wait in the Java code, the loop continues until the queue is empty. Once you process a 'good' element (<=m), you store ans and then continue the loop. The ans keeps overriting until the queue is empty, because in the cases when you have elements, you have to continue.\n\nWait the Java code's loop is:\n\nwhile (!q1.isEmpty()) {\n\n    if (q1.peek() <=m) {\n\n        q1.poll();\n\n        ans= q2.poll();\n\n    } else {\n\n        ... // process and adds back\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAfter processing each case, the queue sizes change. The ans is updated when you poll a \"good\" element. The loop runs until the queue is empty.\n\nThus, the last ans is the value taken from the last element that was removed with q1.poll() being <=m.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran version, when one element is taken (in the if branch), ans is updated. The loop continues even after that case.\n\nThe loop runs until q1 is empty (current_length reaches zero), and when that happens, then you print the last ans.\n\nThus, when the loop ends, the ans has the desired value.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, Declare variables:\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, current_length, i, ans, new_val\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: val, pos\n\nRead n, m.\n\nallocate (val(n), pos(n))\n\n!!! Read n integers into val(1) to val(n)\n\nread *, (val(i), i=1,n)\n\n!!!

Add back. \n\n q1 now becomes [1], and queue2 becomes [5].\n\nNow the queue has element 1. Then the loop continues. \n\nNext iteration: peek is1 which is \u22644 \u2192 ans is5 (second queue's entry for that).\n\nso ans would be overwritten to 5. But the sample expects 4.\n\nAh, this indicates a bug.\n\nWait so what's the correct answer for sample 1? The question's user might have presented a different version. Let me verify the problem.\n\nWait, problem's description may be as follows: \n\nThe problem is from Codeforces 450A. \n\nAccording to https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/450/A:\n\nProblem statement:\n\nThere are n students in the class numbered 1 through n. The number ai determines how many minutes the i-th student is going to spend lying on the floor and blocking the exit. When the fire alarm rings, all students are sitting at their desks. The first student can immediately start moving towards the exit. Each subsequent student can start moving towards the exit only after the student in front them has already started moving. So, the movement of the students takes place in the following order: first student 1 starts moving, then student 2, and so on.\n\nHowever, to exit the classroom each student needs some time. Let\u2019s describe the exit process more formally. Let\u2019s denote by t1, t2, ..., tn the times when students 1, 2, ..., n start moving towards the exit. Then:\n\nt1 = 0,\n\nt < image > = t < image > + a < image \u2013 1 >,\n\nbecause student i cannot start moving until student i\u22121 has started moving.\n\nEach student needs exactly a seconds to reach the exit after they start moving. So the student i exits the classroom at time t < image > + a < image >.\n\nThe only important thing now is the time when each student exits the classroom. All students are leaving the classroom until the first moment when m students have exited. More formally, let\u2019s denote by T the minimum time such that at least m students have exited the classroom by time T. You need to find the number of the student who exited last at time T. If there are multiple students exiting at exactly the time T, choose the one with the largest number.\n\nWait, wait no, the problem might have different conditions, but perhaps I need to check.\n\nWait no, the problem in question is CF problem 450A \"Vasya and the G\u6446\u95e8\".\n\nWait perhaps I got the problem wrong, but assuming the code provided is correct for that problem.\n\nWait the code provided in Java: \n\nThe code 'while (!q1.isEmpty())' and each iteration:\n\nif (q1.pop is element <=m \u2192 then take it as the new ans and then pop both queues.\n\nElse, subtract m and add back.\n\nTherefore after the loop ends, ans is stored, which is the last student whose task time was <=m at the moment it was checked.\n\nThe problem requires finding the student with the maximum number such that the cumulative exit time reaches at least m total? \n\nWait the code might actually be incorrect, but for the sample input 1:\n\nThe sample input 1:\n\nInput:\n\n5 4 (n=5, m=4)\n\n1 2 3 4 5 \u2192 the queue q1: [1,2,3,4,5].\n\nProcessing:\n\nLoop until queue is empty:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\n1<=4, so ans is 1 (q2's first element is 1).\n\nq1 now has [2,3,4,5], q2 [2,3,4,5].\n\nnext iteration first element is 2 which is <=4 \u2192 ans is 2.\n\nthen after 2 is removed: queue is [3,4,5]; ans is 2.\n\nNext, process 3 (<=4 \u2192 ans=3). queue becomes [4,5].\n\n4 is next, which is 4 \u2192 ans=4. q1 now [5].\n\nThen proccess 5>4 \u2192 subtract m=4 \u2192 becomes1, pushed back into q1.\n\nq1 [1]. q2 has [5]. \n\nNext iteration: \n\nelement is 1<=4,\n\nso ans is 5.\n\nThe loop continues until queue is empty.\n\nWhen that element is popped, it becomes empty, so loop ends. Thus ans is 5. But the sample expects 4.\n\nAh, so there's a problem in the code's logic. Probably my assumption about the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait this suggests that the code is incorrect for the problem, but perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nAlternatively perhaps the problem's actual question requires selecting the smallest possible ans?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but I miscalculated the sample.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in the sample's output.\n\nWait the sample input: \n\nSample input 1:\n\n5 4\n\n1 2 3 4 5 \u2192 the output is 4?\n\nBut according to the code, the code outputs 5?\n\nHmm that is a discrepancy.\n\nWait let's check the problem's original statement.\n\nThe problem says that when you have m students evacuated, but perhaps the code calculates a different answer.\n\nMaybe I am misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLooking at the problem 450A's correct solution:\n\nThe problem requires the minimum total time where at least m students exits.\n\nThe critical point is when m students have exited.\n\n The first m students to exit would have to have their exit times summed to determine when it takes.\n\n Wait the actual solution may be as follows:\n\nThe problem requires us to find the time T equal to the sum of the first k students' a_i, which must be <= m, and the next one exceeds.\n\nWait the problem's statement says each student needs a < image > minutes to exit after starting movement.\n\nWait I think the code may be computing the correct solution, but perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect.\n\nLet me go back to the Codeforces problem.\n\nThe problem's statement:\n\nThe problem is to compute the student who is the last one evacuated in the earliest time when m students have exited.\n\nThe time T is the exit time of the m-th student, or the exit time of students with exactly m students exited as of time T, choosing the largest student number.\n\nWait the exit time for student i is t_i +a_i, where t_i is the start time.\n\nThe earliest T such that at least m students have exited by T.\n\nThe student who exits last at time T is the answer.\n\nThe exit times are sequential.\n\n Student 1 takes A(1), exits at A[1]\n\nStudent 2: his exit is T = A[1]+A[2]\n\n\u2026 \n\nStudent k exits at A[1]+A[2]+\u2026+A[k]\n\nThus T needs to be the minimal T such that at least m students have exit time \u2264 T.\n\nSo the minimal T is the exit time of the m-th student, or the first student's where the sum reaches or exceeds m?\n\nNo, that's not correct. The T is the min time where at least m students have exited up to and including T.\n\nThe earliest T: Sum_{i=1}^m A[i].\n\nWait yes. To have m students, the total time is the sum of the first m A_i's.\n\nBut the problem asks to choose the largest numbered among students exiting at time T.\n\nThe sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 4 \u2192 so m=4.\n\n Their first 4's time is sum =1+2+3+4=10.\n\nThe fourth student's exit time is 10 (since each student's exit is cumulative sum up to their own a[i]).\n\nThe fifth's exit would be 15 (sum up to 5 terms). \n\nThus the students exiting at times: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15.\n\nThe first four are at 10, but the fourth student is student4. So the last among them is student4, thus output 4.\n\nBut the java code's logic in the given code:\n\nThe code's answer for that example would be the last element to be removed in the loop which is student5 (when the value becomes 1 after processing the5 ), but that's because in the code's logic whenever you take the current element and it is within m (the m here is the input m?), perhaps the java code is misreading the problem.\n\nWait perhaps the java code is solving the following problem:\n\nWe have students' a values. We need to choose the students to select m total time.\n\nWait perhaps the problem is different, but I think the code's logic is for a problem where the m is a cutoff for the a_i's.\n\nWait the problem in the code is likely the following\uff1a\n\nThe task is to select students in the order until the sum of their a_i is maximized but not exceeding m.\n\nNo, the code's,q1 is the a_i 's, each time you take the first element.\n\nIf its a[i] is \u2264m, subtract it from m and proceed.\n\nWait the code's logic:\n\nInitialize m.\n\n while queue not empty:\n\n        Peen the front.\n\n        if the value is \u2264 current m:\n\n            ans is its position.\n\n            remove it from queue and from the m.\n\n            m -= value.\n\n        else:\n\n            subtract current m from value, and reinsert the value -m into the queue.\n\n            m = wakes.\n\n thus, the while loop continues but the ans variable tracks the last student removed.\n\nThus\uff0c the code is for a different problem.\n\nNow I see <the problem's problem>is not the codeforces 450A. Because the code's behavior diverges from the sample's right answer.\n\nWait the code's java code for sample input 1:\n\nn=5, m=4: the code proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst elements are 1,2,3,4,5 in q1 and positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nq1 is 1, which is \u22644 \u2192 taken. ans is 1 \u2192 m becomes3 (4-1=3).\n\n Then q1 has [2,3,4,5].\n\n Next, q1's first is 2 \u22643 \u2192 ans is2 \u2192 m=1 (3-2=1).\n\n Now queue is [3,4,5].\n\n Next item 3>1 \u2192 can't\u3002 subtract m \uff1a3-1=2 \u2192 push back to q1 \u2192 new q1 is [4,5,2].\n\n m=1 again?\n\nWait, no, the code's logic for the else is:\n\nwhen element >m:\n\nthen, x = q1.poll();\n\nval =x -m \u2192 pushed into queue\u3002\n\nand m remains?\n\nNo, the code doesn't change m. The code's m is the input m.\n\nWait the code's answer is the last student's position that was taken because when the element \u2264m is taken, the code records ans as the corresponding position.\n\nBut in the first sample:\n\nThe code proceeds as:\n\nthe 'ans' variable is updated each time an element is taken when it is \u2264m.\n\nThe 'm' is a input parameter, not a variable.\n\nSo, the code for sample input:\n\nm=4.\n\n first 1<=4 \u2192 ans=1.\n\n next 2<=4 \u2192 ans=2.\n\n 3<=4 \u2192 ans=3.\n\n4<=4 \u2192 ans=4. \n\n then 5>4 \u2192 subtract 4 \u21921 \u2192 push into the end. The queue becomes [1].\n\n Since m is still4.\n\n Next iteration: the first element is1\uff0c which is<=4 \u2192 ans is updated to5 (pos of 5 is5?)\n\n Wait the initial q2 array was 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWhen 4 is taken, the q2 now has 5 as the next?\n\nWait the code\uff1a\n\nWhen you process the elements:\n\neach time when you take an element from \u6c341 and queue2's element taken is added to ans.\n\nWhen the element is taken (ile <=m):\n\n the ans is the q2's first element ( which was the position of that element) \u2192 so when processing the first5 elements:\n\n the first4 are taken:\n\n after removing each, the next positions are in the queue2.\n\n For example, the first iteration removes position1 (1) \u2192 the q2 becomes 2,3,4,5.\n\n then the second iteration removes position2 (ans is set to2). q2\u53d8\u6210\u4e863,4,5.\n\n third iteration \u2192 position3. then position4.\n\n Then the q2 array has [5?] \n\n then the fourth element is 4, pos4 is taken.\n\n Then the fifth student5 is processed: but it's>4 \u2192 subtract4 and add back.\n\n The queues after\uff1a\n\n after processing 5 has been added back to queue1 as1, queue2's\u76f8\u5e94 position is5.\n\n Then, when the\u961f\u5217 now has the first element1 in queue1 (which is the fifth student's Reduced value1), the queue2's first element is5.\n\n Thus, when this1 is taken since1<=4\uff1a\n\n the ans becomes5.\n\n  so the final answer would be5, but the sample's correct answer is4.\n\n Thus the code is incorrect for the stated problem (450A).\n\n This indicates that the java code provided is not for the question posred in the context of the problem.\n\n This means perhaps the user provided the Java code and wants its translation, not considering the correctness of the code for the problem.\n\n Thus, I should proceed to translate the code as is, without considering the problem's correctness.\n\n Thus proceed to write the Fortran translation with the given code's logic.\n\nBased on the previous analysis, the code's translation would be as b ek_written earlier.\n\nRegarding the discrepancy in the sample, that's beyond the current task of translation.\n\nSo, the Fortran\u4ee3\u7801 is as previously outlined.\n\n\u4f46 need to think about edge cases.\n\n\u6bd4\u5982\u5728\u5904\u7406el se case\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53 the current_length is1:\n\n\u6bd4\u5982 the value is 5, m=4.\n\n the else part would reduce it to1, which is stored.\n\n\u5982\u6b64 it's put back into the queue.\n\n then when the loop enters again and it is popped and ans becomes the position.\n\n Thus the code's behavior is to set ans to the last student taken when their a_i is less than or equal to m.\n\n the code increments ans\u6bcf\u6b21 such an occurrence, so the last such occurrence is the answer.\n\n thus the code's logic is to find the last student number whose a_i is among the numbers that can be subtracted from m\u9010\u6e10 until you have processed all possible steps until the queue is empty.\n\n thus, it's possible that the code is designed for a different problem.\n\nRegardless, the translation is needed.\n\nNow, the Fortran code I had earlier has a\u7f3a\u9677 in the else code's loop variable:\n\n\u5728 Fortran\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u8981\u521b\u5efa temporary variables c_pos is needed, which is done correctly.\n\n other variables:\n\n\u5728 the Fortran\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d, \u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\uff1a\n\n\u5728 else\u5757\u4e2d:\n\nnew_val = val(1) - m \n\n c_pos = pos(1) \n\n \u7136\u540e shift the others left.\n\n the loop \u7684i is from 1 to current_length -1 (since current_length was the original length)\n\n then set val(current_length) and pos,current_length = new_val and c_pos.\n\n thus, the Fortran code I wrote should be.\n\n Another note\u662f\uff0c\u5728 Fortran\u4e2d\uff0carrays are\u9ed8\u8ba41-based, so the loops are okay.\n\n \u6211\u7684 code:\n\n\u7a0b\u5e8f\n\nprogram codeforces_450_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, current_length, i, ans, new_val\n\ninteger, allocatable :: val(:), pos(:)\n\n!
