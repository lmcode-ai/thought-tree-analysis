So in the array, q[0], q[1], ..., q[n-1]\n\nThus in Fortran with 0-based arrays, the loop would be i = 1 to n-1 (the upper limit is n-1), so each term:\n\nq[i] = ( q[i-1] + modinv(i+1, mod) ) mod mod.\n\nWait yes. Then the ans loop in Java is for (int i=0; i <n; i++): so for each 0-based index i, compute the terms. So in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 0, n-1 Now, the logic of the code. But first: implementing modinv. Wait in the modinv function in Java, the parameters are a and m. Let's see.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what each part does. The Java code reads some integers from the input, computes some modular arithmetic involving permutations and inverses, and then outputs the result. \n\nFirst, the main parts to handle:\n\nThe main function reads n, then an array a of n integers. Then it calculates a permutation value p as n! mod 1e9+7. Then it computes an array q where each q[i] is the sum up to i of 1/(i+1)! mod mod. Wait, actually looking at the code: q[i] is built using modinv(i+1, mod). Wait, let me see:\n\nIn the q array loop:\n\nq[0] is initialized to 1. Then for each i from 1 to n-1, q[i] is (q[i-1] + modinv(i+1,mod)) mod mod. Hmm, so each element adds the inverse of (i+1) modulo mod. But why?\n\nThen the ans is computed by looping through each a[i], calculating val as the sum of q[i] and q[n-i-1] minus 1, multiplied by a[i], then multiplied by p mod mod. \n\nThe modinv function is the standard extended Euclidean method for modular inverses.\n\nSo, translating to Fortran:\n\nFirst, Fortran has different I/O and array handling. Let me structure this.\n\nFortran uses modules, but maybe the code can be done in a single program. The input part: in Java, BufferedReader is used. In Fortran, probably reading from stdin with Read(*,*) or using a formatted read.\n\nFirst step: Writing the modinv function in Fortran.\n\nThe modinv function in Java is static, so in Fortran I'll have to write a function. The parameters a and m. The function returns the modular inverse modulo m when a and m are coprime. The code uses the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nLooking at the modinv code in Java:\n\nThe variables a and b start with a input value and m (b is initialized to m). Then u and v start as 1 and 0, and so on. The loop continues while b>0.\n\nLet me translate the modinv function.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nFUNCTION modinv(a, m) RESULT(inverse)\n    INTEGER*8 :: a, m, inverse\n    INTEGER*8 :: b, u, v, t, tmp\n    b = m\n    u = 1\n    v = 0\n    DO WHILE (b > 0)\n        t = a / b\n        a = a - t*b ! As in Euclidean step.\n        tmp = a\n        a = b\n        b = tmp\n        u = u - t*v\n        tmp = u\n        u = v\n        v = tmp\n    END DO\n    u = MOD(u, m)\n    IF (u < 0) THEN\n        u = u + m\n    ENDIF\n    inverse = u\nEND FUNCTION\n\nWait, need to check variable types. The original uses long which is 64 bits, so in Fortran we can use INTEGER*8. But maybe mod can be an integer of 32 bits? Well, the modulus here is 1e9+7 which is 10^9+7, which is about 1e9, so a 32-bit integer is not enough (since 2^31 ~2e9). Wait no: 1e9+7 is less than 2^30 (since 2^30 is about 1e9). Wait 2^30 is 1,073,741,824 which is about 1.07e9, so 1e9+7 is bigger than that. Wait exact numbers: 2^30 is 1073741824. 1e9+7 is 1000000007 which is approximately 1e9. So, 30 bits? So a 32-bit integer would be okay, but when doing multiplication, in the permutation calculation, n! mod 1e9+7. The maximum n here might need to be considered. Let's see. The permutation p is n factorial mod mod. So the maximum n such that n! can exceed mod is up to, say 1e5 or so, but given that modinv is called with larger numbers, maybe using 64 bits for variables is safer. Let's proceed with INTEGER*8 for all variables except a and mod unless stated otherwise.\n\nWait, in Fortran, for integers, we have to be precise about the sizes.\n\nHmm. Let me clarify the variables in the code.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nmod is an int (32 bits), but 1e9+7 is within that.\n\nVariables p and q are long (64 bits). So in Fortran, to mirror, the variables p and q array need to be 64 bits. The mod is an integer, but in 32 bits might be okay.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nIn Fortran code structure:\n\nFirst, the program:\n\nProgram atcoder_agc028_b\n   Implicit None\n   Integer :: n, mod_\n   Integer(8), Dimension(:), Allocatable :: a, q\n   Integer(8) :: p, ans, val, i\n   ...\n\nBut I need to read the input. The first line is n, the second line is n numbers.\n\nWait, Steps to translate the Java code:\n\nRead n from input. Then read next line as strings, split into sa array, then convert to integers a[i].\n\nIn Fortran, the second line input is read as a string, then split into tokens, but Fortran does not split automatically. So perhaps read using a formatted read.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, when reading from stdin, the second read can read all the numbers in one line.\n\nLet's think:\n\nIn the main code:\n\nFirst, read n. Then read n integers into the array a.\n\nBut in the Java code, the second line is split with space. Maybe the input is given with all the numbers on the second line separated by spaces.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nRead(*,*) n\nRead(*,*) (a(i), i = 1, n)\n\nAssuming a is an allocated array first. Wait, but in Fortran arrays are declared with dimension when you can, but since the size is n, which is read first, we need to use an allocatable array.\n\nSo step by step:\n\nMain program outline:\n\nProgram atcoder_agc028_b\n    Implicit None\n    Integer :: i, n, mod_\n    Integer(8), Allocatable :: a(:), q(:)\n    Integer(8) :: p, ans, val\n\n    Read(*,*) n\n    Allocate(a(n))\n    Read(*,*) a(1:n)\n    mod_ = 1000000007\n    ! Compute p = n! mod mod_\n    p = 1\n    Do i = 2, n\n        p = Mod(p * i, mod_)\n    End Do\n\n    ! Compute q array\n    Allocate(q(n))\n    q(1) = 1  ! Wait, in Java, q[0] = 1. But in Fortran arrays are 1-based unless specified. So need to make sure whether to start at 1 or 0.\n\nWait a problem here: the Java code uses 0-based arrays. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but you can declare with different lower bounds.\n\nAh, so if in the Java code, the array a is 0-based, then in Fortran, I need to adjust indices, maybe using arrays starting from 0. Or shift indices.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the Java loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { a[i] = ... } \n\nSo the array in Java is from 0 to n-1.\n\nIn Fortran, since arrays are 1-based by default, perhaps better to make the Fortran arrays start at 0, but in Fortran, you can define them as:\n\nINTEGER(8), DIMENSION(n) :: a (0:n-1)\n\nWait, but allocation and dimensions?\n\nAlternatively, proceed with 1-based arrays and adjust indices:\n\nIn Java:\n\nq[0] = 1;\n\nIn Fortran, if we have the array as 1-based, then q(1) would be analogous to q[0] in Java. Therefore, in code:\n\nq(1) = 1\n\nthen, for i from 2 to n (Java's i from 1 to n-1, which in 0-based would be 1 corresponds to i=1 in Java, so maybe variables are shifted)\n\nWait, the loop in the Java code for q:\n\nfor(int i =1; i <n; i++) { q[i] = (q[i-1] + modinv(i+1, mod))%mod; }\n\nBecause in Java, the array q has n elements (indices 0 to n-1). Wait wait: the Java code declares:\n\nint[] a = new int[n]; // size n.\n\nlong q is of length n. So the q array has elements from 0 to n-1 (in Java, 0-based). \n\nThus, in Fortran, if using 1-based:\n\nThe q array has indices 1 to n. So the loop in Java for i from 1 to (n-1) in the for statement (since i <n corresponds to i max n-2 in for 0-based? Wait no. Let's see:\n\nWait the Java code's q loop runs from i=1 to i= n-1? Because it says for (int i =1; i <n; i++).\n\nHence in Java, the term for each i (from 1 to n-1), so for those elements, q[i] is computed as q[i-1] + modinv(i+1, mod). \n\nSo translating to Fortran with 1-based arrays:\n\nThe loop would be over i from 2 to n-1? Wait no: in Fortran's q array starting at 1:\n\nOriginal loop in Java:\n\ni starts at 1 (Java's q[i] where i=1). So Java's q[1] corresponds to Fortran's q(2). For example:\n\nJava index | Fortran assumed (since Fortran is 1-based but we need to make it 0-based? Maybe better to realign everything.) Alternatively, use dummy variables. Alternatively, adjust indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fortran arrays can be declared with 0-based indices by specifying:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(:), allocatable :: a => a(0:n-1)\n\nBut in Fortran 90 or higher, it's allowed with explicit lower bounds.\n\nWait maybe better to use 0-based indices here. Let me see:\n\nLet me think of the Fortran code variables. Let me redefine:\n\nLet's declare variables as:\n\nINTEGER, PARAMETER :: M = 1000000007\nINTEGER :: n\nINTEGER(8), ALLOCATABLE :: a(:), q(:)  ! 0-based arrays\nINTEGER(8) :: p, ans\n\nSo then, in Fortran, after reading n, allocate a(0:n-1), then the loop for the array:\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\nSimilarly for the q array, allocated as 0 :n-1.\n\nThis approach avoids index confusion.\n\nSo that's the first problem: how Fortran handles arrays. By using arrays with lower bound 0, the code will be more straightforward to translate from Java to Fortran.\n\nTo declare an array with a lower bound of 0, I can use:\n\nallocate(a(0:n-1))\n\nSame for q.\n\nHence the steps:\n\nRead n. Allocate a(0:n-1). Read the a array (with 0-based index) from the second line.\n\nThen compute p as the product from 2 up to n (so n! mod M). That's done similarly.\n\nThen for q, allocated as 0-based array of size n. Set q(0) =1.\n\nThen loop from i=1 to n-1 (since in java, i starts from 1 up to n-1 in the loop for q's loop (because the original condition is i < n), meaning i runs from 1 up to n-1. Therefore in Fortran's 0-based, the same indices would apply, so the loop is from 1 to n-1.\n\nWait:\n\nThe q loop for the second step in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++){\n\nso the indices for i in Java go 1,2,..., n-1 (since i starts at 1, the upper limit is less than n). So in the array, q[0], q[1], ..., q[n-1]\n\nThus in Fortran with 0-based arrays, the loop would be i = 1 to n-1 (the upper limit is n-1), so each term:\n\nq[i] = ( q[i-1] + modinv(i+1, mod) ) mod mod.\n\nWait yes.\n\nThen the ans loop in Java is for (int i=0; i <n; i++):\n\nso for each 0-based index i, compute the terms. So in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 0, n-1\n\nNow, the logic of the code.\n\nBut first: implementing modinv.\n\nWait in the modinv function in Java, the parameters are a and m. Let's see. The function modinv in java receives long a and int m, returns long. \n\nIn Fortran, the function will need to take integers. Since mod_ is an integer here:\n\nBut parameters must be passed properly. Let's see. The function modinv should take a and m as integers. But since m is mod_ (which is 1e9+7), and a is a number which during calculation could be up to n for modinv? For example, in the q array loop, when calculating modinv(i+1, mod), since i ranges to n-1, so i+1 goes up to n. For modulus mod, which is a prime (since 1e9+7 is a known prime), the inverse exists as long as a is not zero mod. Well, modinv is called with some a up to n, which is good.\n\nWait, the parameters in code in the q array loop:\n\nIn q's case, the modinv is called with (i+1, mod). So i is up to n-1, so i+1 can be up to n. So modinv is called with i+1 (which could be up to n) and mod (1e9+7). Since mod is prime and i+1 < mod (assuming n is up to say 1e6), so the inverse exists. So the parameters are okay.\n\nThus, the modinv function in Fortran will take two integers (or integers(8)), but in Fortran the modulus (M) is 1e9+7. The function returns an integer.\n\nWait the modinv function in the Java code returns a value u between 0 and mod. The function in Fortran should take an 'a' and 'm' (mod value). Let's see:\n\nFUNCTION modinv(a, m) RESULT (res)\n   INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a, m\n   INTEGER(8) :: res, b, u, v, t, tmp\n   b = m\n   u = 1\n   v = 0\n   DO WHILE (b > 0)\n      t = a / b\n      a = a - t*b\n      tmp = a\n      a = b\n      b = tmp\n      u = u - t*v\n      tmp = u\n      u = v\n      v = tmp\n   END DO\n   u = MOD(u, m)\n   IF (u < 0) u = u + m\n   res = u\nEND FUNCTION modinv\n\nWait the variables here are all integers, with *8 or not? Let me see the variables in each step.\n\nIn Java's code, a (the input parameter) is a long, so 64 bits. mod is passed in as an integer, but in the code, in Fortran, the m is integer (already 4 bytes?), but if we use mod as an INTEGER*8 variable, perhaps better to make all parameters integers(8).\n\nWait maybe to avoid overflow.\n\nLet me re-examine the variables in the function:\n\nThe function modinv parameters a and m are both integers. The algorithm does divisions (a /b, etc). So the variables u and v can become large: their values can be up to m's size. Since 1e9+7 is manageable with an integer (unless it's an overflow during processing).\n\nAlternatively, in For thought: use 64-bit integers for all variables involved in modinv to prevent overflow. The maximum modulus is about 1e9, so even in 32 bits, it's okay as variables are stored mod modulus each step perhaps not?\n\nWait in modinv, during the operations, a and b are being manipulated. Initially, a and b are in the hundreds of millions. So the divisions and multiplications might need to be done without intermediate overflow, so integers of 64 bits would be better.\n\nHence, in the modinv function, all variables (a, b, u, v, etc.) are declared as 64-bit integers (integer(8)).\n\nTherefore, the function should have parameters and variables of 8 bytes.\n\nSo, the function:\n\nFUNCTION modinv(a, m) RESULT(inverse)\n    INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a, m\n    INTEGER(8) :: inverse, b, u, v, t, tmp\n    ! Implementation as above.\n    ...\nEND FUNCTION\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThen, in the main program:\n\nRead n, then the array a (0-based). \n\nNow, calculate p = factorial(n) mod mod.\n\nThen the q array:\n\nq is an array of integers(8), 0-based size n. \n\nq(0) =1.\n\nLoop from i=1 to n-1:\n\nq[i] = (q(i-1) + modinv( i+1, mod )) mod mod.\n\nWait wait: for each q[i], in the Java code, adding in the modinv of (i+1, mod). \n\nYes. \n\nThen the ans is computed by looping over each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nval = q[i] + q (n -i -1) -1 \n\nWait, let's analyze:\n\nThe Java code has for each a[i], the value of val is set as follows:\n\nval = q[i] + q[ n -i -1 ] -1 \n\nWait in Java, when you have q[n-i-1], since in the Java code arrays run 0-based up to (n-1), the term n -i -1 gives an index such that when i is 0, the term is q[n-1], when i is at the middle, etc.\n\nIn the Fortran code with 0-based arrays, that directly maps.\n\nThen, val multiplied by a[i]. Then multiplied by p mod mod. So the code:\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n   val = ( q(i) + q(n -i -1) -1 ) \n   val = mod( val * a(i), mod_ ) \n   val = mod( val * p, mod_ )\n   ans = mod( ans + val, mod_)\nend do\n\nWait but handling the modular arithmetic steps correctly:\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nval starts as q[i] + q[n-i-1] -1, then multiplied by a[i], then mod mod, then multiplied by p, mod mod, then added to ans, mod mod.\n\nIn Fortran code, each step should be:\n\nval = (q(i) + q(n - i - 1) - 1)\nval = mod( val * a(i), mod_ )\nval = mod( val * p, mod_ )\nans = mod( ans + val, mod_ )\n\nAll steps done step by step. Since in Fortran, mod is an intrinsic function.\n\nSo that's the logic.\n\nNow putting all pieces together:\n\nNow, the modinv function has to be placed either before the program or inside a module. Since Fortran requires function declarations before use, let me put the function modinv in the same program unit, using a contains clause.\n\nWait in Fortran, the program must contain the function via a contains block.\n\nSo structure:\n\nProgram AtCoder_AGC028_B\n    Implicit None\n    Integer(8), Parameter :: MOD_ = 1000000007\n    Integer :: n, i\n    Integer(8), Allocatable :: a(:), q(:)\n    Integer(8) :: p, ans, val\n\n    Read(*,*) n\n    Allocate( a(0:n-1), q(0:n-1) )\n    Read(*,*) a(:)\n\n    ! compute p = n! mod MOD_\n    p = 1\n    Do i = 2, n\n        p = mod( p * i, MOD_ )\n    End Do\n\n    ! compute q array\n    q(0) = 1\n    Do i = 1, n-1\n        q(i) = mod( q(i-1) + modinv( int(i+1,8), MOD_ ), MOD_ )\n    End Do\n\n    ! compute ans\n    ans = 0\n    Do i = 0, n-1\n        val = ( q(i) + q(n -i -1 ) - 1 )\n        val = mod( val * a(i), MOD_ )\n        val = mod( val * p, MOD_ )\n        ans = mod( ans + val, MOD_ )\n    End Do\n\n    Write(*,*) ans\nContains\n    Integer(8) Function modinv(a, m)\n        Integer(8), Intent(In) :: a, m\n        Integer(8) :: b, u, v, t, tmp\n        b = m\n        u = 1\n        v = 0\n        Do while (b > 0)\n            t = a / b\n            tmp = a - t*b\n            a = b\n            b = tmp\n            \n            tmp = u - t*v\n            u = v\n            v = tmp\n        End Do\n        ! correction: the algorithm in Java loops and swaps a and b each time. \n        ! Oh wait, I think I might have messed up the steps here.\n\n        Wait looking back to modinv code in Java:\n\n        long t = a / b;\n        a -= t * b; --> a = a - t * b\n        tmp = a (this a after subtraction is original a minus t*b)\n        a = b\n        b = tmp\n\nSo perhaps my modinv loop is missing some steps here.\n\nLet's re-transcribe the modinv function precisely.\n\nOriginal Java modinv:\n\nstatic long modinv(long a, int m) { \n    long b = m; \n    long u = 1, v = 0; \n    long tmp =0; \n    while(b>0){\n\n        long t = a/b; // quotient\n        a -= t*b; // a is a mod b now?\n        tmp = a; \n        a = b; \n        b = tmp; // swap a and b: now a becomes b, and b is the previous a-t*b (temporary?)\n\n        u -= t*v; // compute new u\n        tmp =u; \n        u = v; \n        v = tmp; \n    }\n\nWait perhaps better to step through with an example:\n\nBut in any case, to code that, let me re-express:\n\nThe code in the Java modinv function is a standard extended Euclidean step.\n\nVariables:\n\nInitialize b with m (that's the modulus value input as second parameter m).\n\nThe loop steps through the Euclidean algorithm, keeping track of coefficients.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n while (b > 0):\n\n    t = a divided by b (floor division)\n\n    a and b swap places as follows:\n\n    a = a - t*b (equals the remainder from division: a mod b )\n\n    but then, the next a is b and the next b is the remainder (a mod b)\n\n    the variables a and b are swapped in such a way.\n\n    The code sets:\n\n    tmp = a - t*b --> because a is decremented by t*b before the swap (?)\n\nWait in code step after t = a / b:\n\na -= t*b => new a is a mod b.\n\nThen, they set tmp = a (thus tmp holds the remainder)\n\nThen set a = b (so the previous b becomes a)\n\nSet b = tmp (the remainder).\n\nThus after each loop, a and b have a decreased in roles.\n\nAs per Euclidean steps, but with a and b swapped into positions of gcd, perhaps.\n\nWhile doing this, variables u and v are updated to hold the coefficients such that GCD = (new a)*u + ... ?\n\nAlternatively, the iteration maintains the equation:\n\na * u + b * v = prev ... \n\nThis is getting complex. The correct codes must mirror exactly.\n\nLet me try re-coding the modinv function in Fortran correctly, step by step.\n\nThe steps inside the loop body:\n\nIn the Java code inside the while (b > 0) loop:\n\ntemp variables:\n\n1. compute t = a / b.\n\n2. subtract t*b from a: a = a - t*b. So a now holds the remainder, but actually this is a mod b?\n\nWait, but then the next steps:\n\nThen:\n\ntmp = a (original's now remainder) \n\nswap a and b: set a = b, b = tmp \n\nThen the next loop iteration uses new a and b.\n\nWait in code:\n\na = b \n\nb = tmp (which is the remainder)\n\nSo this is the standard Euclidean step, the remainder becomes the next 'b' (after swapping).\n\nTherefore the loop continues until b becomes 0.\n\nNow in code variables in Java:\n\nThe variables u and v are the Bezout coefficients.\n\nThe steps after the division are:\n\nu -= t * v:\n\nthen:\n\ntmp =u, then u = v, v = tmp.\n\nWait in code:\n\nu -= t*v \n\nthen, tmp =u \n\nthen, u =v \n\nv = tmp. \n\nWait that's swapping? \n\nWait the sequence:\n\nFor u and v:\n\nThe current u is for a, v for b?\n\nNot sure about the coefficients, but in code:\n\nThe code performs:\n\nu = u - t*v\n\nthen:\n\ntmp = u \n\nu = v \n\nv = tmp \n\nSo effectively, after adding the t*v term?\n\nHmm this is quite complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can translate the code step by step.\n\nThe modinv code in Java is:\n\ntemp variables (translation to Fortran):\n\nVariables:\n\na and b (parameters and variables as in the function)\n\nu, v, t, tmp.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nt = a divided by b (integer division)\n\na = a minus t*b.\n\ntmp = a (which is the new a - t*b)\n\na is set to b (old b's value)\n\nb is set to tmp (the new remainder).\n\nThen for u and v:\n\nu = u - t * v\n\ntemp = u \n\nu = v \n\nv = temp \n\nWait, after that, the coefficients?\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose a starts as the number whose inverse is desired (e.g., 3, mod 7)\n\nLet m =7, so b starts at 7.\n\nu starts at 1, v at 0 (as in Java function).\n\nInitial values:\n\na =3, b=7, u=1, v=0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nt = 3/7 = 0. So no change.\n\na = 3 -0 *7 =3.\n\nSo we set tmp = 3, then:\n\na (original b's value) is 7 \u2192 stored in a.\n\nThe new b becomes tmp (3). \n\nThen the u update: u was 1, subtract t*v is 0 \u2192 u remains 1.\n\ntmp2 =u (1). u is assigned v (0) \u2192 u becomes 0. v becomes 1.\n\nNow the variables are:\n\na =7, b=3. u=0, v=1.\n\nLoop again:\n\nt = 7/3 = 2 (since 2*3=6 <7)\n\na new is 7 -2*3=1\n\ntmp =1.\n\nNew a becomes 3 (previous b)\n\nnew b is tmp =1\n\nFor u:\n\nu (0) - t *v (2 *1) \u2192 0-2*1 =-2\n\ntmp is -2 \u2192 stored into tmp variable, then u becomes v's 1, then v gets -2.\n\nSo after this step:\n\na=3, b=1, u=1, v=-2.\n\nNext iteration: b is now 1>0 \u2192 loop continues:\n\nt =3/1 =3.\n\na new = 3 -3*1 =0 \u2192 since 3 mod 1 is 0.\n\nSet a to 1, b to 0 \u2192 next loop ends.\n\nSo at this point, since we're leaving the loop:\n\nGCD is 1, the iteration leaves.\n\nThe u at exit is 1 (the value of u from previous steps?), and need to compute u mod m. \n\nWait, after loop terminates, when b is 0, the u is stored as ?\n\nWait in the step before the loop exits, let's see:\n\nback to this example:\n\nLoop after the above steps:\n\nstate is a=3, b=1, u=1, v= -2.\n\nIn loop:\n\nt =3//1 =3.\n\na=3 -3*1=0 \n\ntmp =0 \u2192 a is now set to previous b (1) \u2192 a=1.\n\nNew b is 0 (tmp was 0). So now, in next loop, b is 0 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nThus, variables after the loop:\n\na is 1, b=0, u is 0? Or what?\n\nWait let's walk through next steps in the next iteration.\n\nAt this iteration, a is 3, b=1.\n\nt = a / b \u2192 3/1=3. \n\na =3 - 3*1 =0 \u2192 then tmp =0. \n\nSet a = previous b (1).\n\nSet b to tmp (0).\n\nThen, handling u and v:\n\nu = 1 (original u before this loop) minus t*v (3*(-2)) \u2192 1 - (3*(-2)) = 1 +6=7 \u2192 So u becomes 7? Wait, no, sorry:\n\nIn code, previous variables were u and v before entering this iteration.\n\nIn the current iteration (a=3, b=1):\n\nBefore processing this iteration, the u and v were 1 and -2.\n\nSo:\n\nu := u - t * v \u2192 which is 1 - 3*( -2 ) \u2192 1 +6 =7.\n\nThen, tmp = u =7 \n\nthen u = v (-2)\n\nv = tmp (7)\n\n so after the step, u is -2 and v is7.\n\nAfter the a and b values are set to 1 and 0:\n\nNow the loop continues with b=0 which ends.\n\nThus, exiting loop, the current u is -2 (since the u was set to v (v's previous value is now 7 ??? Wait perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait in code, the steps for u and v in the loop iteration:\n\nStarting before the loop iteration (for the a=3, b=1 case):\n\nu was 1, v was -2.\n\nCompute t=3.\n\nThen:\n\nu = u - t*v \u2192 1 - 3*(-2) \u2192 1 +6=7. \n\nThen, tmp stores u's value (7)\n\nthen:\n\nu =v \u2192 u becomes the old v (-2)\n\nv = tmp (7)\n\nSo after this iteration's calculations, the u and v are now:\n\nnew u: previous v, which was -2,\n\n new v: 7 (tmp which was 7).\n\n Thus, after processing variables:\n\n a is now 1 (was b's old value, which was 1)\n\n b is now 0 (tmp was 0).\n\nThus, after this loop iteration, the loop checks while (b >0), which 0 is, so we exit.\n\nFinally, after the loo\n\nThe u is -2 here.\n\nSo then:\n\nu = -2 mod 7 \u2192 modulus 7, so -2 \u2192 5 mod7 is 5.\n\nSo inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, which is correct (3 *5 =15 mod7 is 1).\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nTherefore, the code's modinv function produces the correct result.\n\nNow, returning to code transcription:\n\nThe steps in modinv must be exactly copied in Fortran.\n\nSo here's the correct modinv function:\n\nFUNCTION modinv(a_input, m) RESULT (res)\n    INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a_input, m\n    INTEGER(8) :: a, b, u, v, t, tmp, res\n    a = a_input  ! make a a local mutable variable\n    b = m        ! m is the parameter input for mod value.\n    u = 1\n    v = 0\n    tmp =0\n    DO WHILE (b > 0)\n        t = a / b ! integer division\n        tmp = a - t*b\n        a = b      ! a becomes the old b\n        b = tmp    ! b is now remainder (old a - t*b)\n        tmp = u - t*v\n        u = v\n        v = tmp\n    END DO\n    tmp = u\n    tmp = MOD(tmp, m)\n    IF (tmp <0) tmp = tmp + m  \n    res = tmp\nEND FUNCTION modinv\n\nWait wait, I think I missed the variables.\n\nWait in the code steps, after swapping a and b (in terms of a and b variables)?\n\nWait no, the variables:\n\nWait the first steps:\n\nIn each loop iteration, the code must compute:\n\n t = a_old / b_old \n\n a_new = b_old \n\nb_new = a_old - t * b_old \n\nThat's correct.\n\nThen, handling u and v:\n\nthe new u is u_old - t*v_old \n\n then, swap u and v ?\n\nWait, the code in the Java had:\n\nu = u - t*v \n\nthen, swap u and v's values using tmp?\n\nWait in code:\n\nIn the Java code inside the loop after a and b are updated (swap):\n\nu = u - t*v \n\nthen:\n\ntmp =u (the new u value?)\n\nthen set u = v,\n\nv = tmp (the previous u's updated value).\n\nHence, the update steps for u and v are:\n\n temp_u = u - t*v \n\nthen:\n\nu becomes v \n\nv becomes temp_u \n\nWait not exactly. Let me map:\n\nThe sequence in Java:\n\n    u -= t * v; // compute new u (u = u - t*v )\n\n    tmp = u; // temp_u is now stored in tmp\n\n    u = v; // now u is set to old v \n\n    v = tmp; // v is set to the new_u (u after subtraction)\n\nHence yes, the net effect is:\n\nnew u is old v\n\nnew v is old u - t*v \n\nTherefore in code Fortran, the steps are:\n\n original variables u and v.\n\n t = floor(a/b)\n\n tmp is the remainder.\n\n a and b are updated.\n\n then:\n\n oldu = u \n\n oldv = v \n\n temp = oldu - t*oldv \n\n u becomes oldv \n\n v becomes temp \n\n thus, after this step, u = oldv \n\n v = oldu - t oldv \n\nWhich is the standard extended euclidean coefficients.\n\nSo in code, the variables:\n\n within the loop:\n\n after computing t, then the swap of a and b (except) as above, the steps:\n\n Before moving variables:\n\n first the a and b are updated:\n\ntmp = a -t*b \u2192 remainder \n\nthen:\n\ntempa = a (the old a)\n\na = b \n\nb = tmp \n\n then, the coefficients:\n\nu becomes previous u - t*v \u2192 so the temp variable:\n\ntmp = u - t*v \n\nthen, u is assigned v \n\nv is assigned tmp \n\n hence, in Fortran, the sequence is:\n\ntmp_uv = u - t*v \n\nthen \n\ntmp_u = u \n\ntmp_v = v \n\nu = v \n\nv = tmp_uv \n\nWhich is implemented as:\n\ntmp = u - t * v \n\nu = v \n\n Then v = tmp \n\nWait, but in code:\n\nTo avoid overwriting during calculation:\n\n temp_u = u - t*v \n\n so, the code steps in Fortran:\n\n \n\n tmp = u - t * v \n\n then:\n\n save current value of u and v, then set new values?\n\nAlternatively, directly:\n\n we can write:\n\n temp = u \n\n u = v \n\n v = temp - t*v \n\n wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nThe correct steps:\n\nThe correct equation:\n\n after the division step, new u and v are:\n\nu_new = v_old \n\nv_new = u_old - t *v_old \n\nYes, because the update steps are:\n\nu = u - t*v \n\nthen, u takes the value of v.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSuppose in the loop step:\n\nOld variables: u_old and v_old \n\nFirst compute u_new_candidate (before the swapping) as u_old - t*v_old \n\n then:\n\n u becomes v_old \n\n v becomes u_new_candidate \n\nYes, exactly.\n\nThus the steps in code must be:\n\n temp_u = u \n\n u = v \n\n v = temp_u - t*v \n\n \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nt = a / b \n\ntmp_b = a - t*b \n\na_old = a \n\na = b \n\nb = tmp_b \n\n \n\n Now, update u and v:\n\ntemp_u = u - t*v \n\n \n\nu = v \n\nv = temp_u \n\n \n\n Thus, the variables can be updated as:\n\n \n\n So in code inside the loop body:\n\n t = a / b \n\ntmp_b = a - t*b \n\n \n\n temp_u = u - t*v \n\n \n\n u = v \n\n v = temp_u \n\n \n\n a = b \n\n b = tmp_b \n\nHmm but the order must be that a is set next, so a and b are updated only after.\n\nSo steps:\n\n first compute t.\n\n compute tmp_b = a -t*b \u2192 this is for b's next value.\n\n \n\n then, the u and v get updated based on temp_u.\n\n then, set a to previous b \n\n set b to tmp_b \n\n Thus, in code:\n\n \n\n Now in the loop in Fortran modinv function:\n\n Do while (b>0)\n\n t = a / b \n\n tmp_b = a - t*b \n\n temp_u = u - t*v \n\n u = v \n\n v = temp_u \n\n a_val = a \n\n a = b \n\n b = tmp_b \n\n \n\nEnd do \n\nWait but in code variables, a and b must be variables that can be modified.\n\nAlternatively, substituting:\n\n code:\n\n \n\n inside the loop:\n\n \n\n t = a / b \n\n delta = a -t*b \n\n \n\n temp_u = u - t*v \n\n \n\n u = v \n\n v = temp_u \n\n \n\n a, b = b, delta \n\n so a and b swap and get delta as new b's value.\n\nThus, this needs to be coded step by step.\n\nTherefore, the function's interior becomes:\n\nFUNCTION modinv(a_input, m) RESULT (res)\n    INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a_input, m\n    INTEGER(8) :: a, b, u, v, t, delta_u, temp_u, temp_v\n    a = a_input\n    b = m\n    u = 1\n    v = 0\n    DO while (b >0)\n        t = a / b\n        delta = a - t*b\n\n        temp_u = u - t * v\n        ! update u and v \n\n        temp_v = v \n\n        !
