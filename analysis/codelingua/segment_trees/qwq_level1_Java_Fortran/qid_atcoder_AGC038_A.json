    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what the code does first. The Java program reads four integers H, W, A, B. Then it checks if W is less than 2*A or H less than 2*B, in which case it prints -1. Otherwise, it loops through rows and columns, and for each cell, prints 0 or 1 based on the conditions (i < B...). Then outputs all rows with newlines.\n\nHmm. So, let's start with the basics. The Fortran code should read from standard input and write to standard output. For Java's Scanner, in Fortran I can use read(*,*) for inputs. The BufferedWriter in Java is for writing outputs efficiently, but in Fortran, just using write statements with * as the unit should be okay, maybe with newlines.\n\nFirst, variables: the Java code uses integers H, W, A, B. In Fortran, we can declare them as integers. The condition is the same: if W < 2*A or H < 2*B, output -1.\n\nWait the condition is written as 'if (W < 2 * A || H < 2 * B) { ... }', so in Fortran, that's 'if (W .lt. 2*A .or. H .lt. 2*B) then...'.\n\nNow the loops: the Java code has two loops for i from 0 to H-1 and j from 0 to W-1. But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless specified otherwise. Wait, but the loops start at 0 in Java. So in Fortran's loops, perhaps we'll have i starting at 0? Although in Fortran, the loop variable can be set to start at 0. Alternatively, maybe just adjust the indices appropriately.\n\nWait, in Java, the for loops are:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < H; i++)... That is, H rows, starting at 0 up to H-1.\n\nSame with j. So in Fortran, to replicate the same indices (starting at 0), we can do something like:\n\ndo i = 0, H -1\n   do j=0, W-1\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop indices can start at 0 if declared properly. So variables are declared with appropriate integer types.\n\nThe main condition inside the loops is checking whether (i < B and j <A) OR (i >= B AND j >= A). In Java's case, in that case, write 0 else 1. Then, after each row, a new line is written.\n\nWait the Java condition is written as:\n\nif ((i < B && j < A) || (i >= B) && (j >= A)) then write 0, else 1.\n\nWait the second part: (i >= B) && (j >= A). So the condition is ( (i < B and j < A) ) OR (i >= B and j >= A ), so then 0, else 1. That essentially splits the grid into four quadrants. The area in the lower left (upper left?) quadrant less than B rows and A columns would be 0; the opposite quadrant (third quadrant) is also 0, and the rest 1. Wait maybe I should think visually. \n\nSuppose B divides the rows. And A divides columns. So imagine a cross. The first part is the top left (0 to B-1 rows and 0 to A-1 columns) and bottom right (from B rows to H-1, and from A columns to W-1) are 0. The bands in between are 1.\n\nHmm, that's the pattern. So the Fortran code must replicate that.\n\nNow writing that condition in Fortran:\n\nIf ( (i < B .and. j < A ) .or. (i >= B .and. j >= A) ) then: write 0 else 1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif ( ( i < B .and. j < A ) .or. ( i >= B .and. j >= A ) ) then \n    write(unt,fmt) '0'\nelse\n    write(unt,fmt) '1'\n\nBut the printing must be done in a single line for each row. Since in Java, they write each character immediately, and then a newline. So in Fortran, perhaps for each row, we build a string, then write a line.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, write all the characters first, then a new line. The problem is how to do it.\n\nIn Fortran program, the following approach: create a character array for each row, then write the row with a format without spaces?\n\nAlternatively, write the char for each position, but to prevent new line after each character, using an appropriate format.\n\nHmm, in Fortran, the write statement can have multiple elements. For each row:\n\ndo i...\n   do j...\n      if condition then char = '0' else '1'\n   then after j loop, write the entire row as a string.\n\nAlternatively, the row is built character by character.\n\nHmm, perhaps the Fortran code can loop over each row, then loop over each column, building a string for the row, then printing it once per row.\n\nFor example, inside the i loop, have a string of length W, then write that string followed by a new line.\n\nAlternatively, directly write each character, but in a single write statement for the entire line. The problem is, without knowing the width, perhaps the best way is to simply write each character as a single character, but formatted such that each is printed without space, then after reaching the end of the row, a new line.\n\nWait in Java, they use 'bw.write(\"0\")' for each character, and then after each row, 'bw.newLine()' So in Fortran, perhaps we can do a loop over each column, and write the character, then after the loop, advance no, and advance yes. Wait, let me think.\n\nIn Fortran, when writing, each write statement normally goes to a new line unless specified. To write all the characters in one line, perhaps using a format that suppresses the new line.\n\nAlternatively, here's the approach:\n\nWithin the row (i loop):\n\nDefine a character array or string to build the row.\n\nInside the j loop, for each j, append '0' or '1' to a character array.\n\nThen once the row is built, write that array as a single string.\n\nAlternatively, writing each character with an asterisk format to append.\n\nWait:\n\nLet me think step by step for the Fortran code structure:\n\nProgram code:\n\nprogram main\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: H, W, A, B, i, j\n   character(len=1) :: c\n   character(len=:), allocatable :: line\n\n   read(*,*) H, W, A, B\n\n   if ( ( W < 2*A ) .or. ( H < 2*B ) ) then\n      write(*,*) -1\n      stop\n   end if\n\n   do i = 0, H -1\n\n      line = ''\n      do j =0, W-1\n         if ( (i < B .and. j < A ) .or. (i >= B .and. j >= A ) ) then\n             c = '0'\n         else\n             c = '1'\n         end if\n         ! append c to line, but building string dynamically in Fortran is tricky.\n         ! perhaps we have to have a fixed length array.\n\n      end do\n      write(*,\"(A)\") trim(line)\n\n   end do\nend program.\n\nWait but building the line as a string is complicated in Fortran. Because Fortran strings are a bit limited. Instead of dynamic strings, perhaps the correct approach is to preallocate an array of characters of length W for each line, fill that, then write the array.\n\nAlternatively, in each row, for each j from 0 to W-1, compute the character, and write it with a format that doesn't advance to new line.\n\nLike:\n\nInside the i loop:\n\n   write statement for the entire line.\n\nWait, let's try to structure the code:\n\nMaybe using a character array with length W:\n\ndo i=0,H-1\n\n   character(len=W) :: s\n   s = ' '  ! Initialize all to blanks? Not really, need '0's and '1's.\n\n   do j =0, W-1\n\n      if (condition) then\n         char = '0'\n      else\n         char = '1'\n      endif\n\n      s(j+1:j+1) = char   ! Because in Fortran arrays are 1-based.\n\n   end do\n\n   write(*, \"(A)\") trim(s)  ! but s is supposed to be exactly W characters.\n\nend do\n\nWait yes, because in s, which is length W, each character is set properly. Then writing it with a format that can read W characters.\n\nWait perhaps:\n\n   write(*,\"(A)\") s(1:W)\n\nWait, because s is already length W, so the A format should handle it.\n\nWait in Fortran, when writing a character variable of length W with (A), it should output all characters.\n\nWait in this case, s will be exactly W characters long. So trim is unnecessary? Well no. Because if s is declared as length W, then the entire string is written. So trimming wouldn't help. Hmm.\n\nWait the code to set each s(j+1:j+1) = char: since in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default. So for the first character when j is 0, we do s(1:1) = char. So that's correct.\n\nWait let me verify:\n\nj =0 => j+1 =1.\n\nj= W-1 => j+1 = W. So yes.\n\nSo yes, a character array of length W, initialized (maybe filled with blanks, but then all positions are assigned) would be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can create a character array and loop through each position.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: H, W, A, B, i, j\ncharacter(len=1) :: c\ncharacter(len= :), allocatable :: row\n\nread(*, *) H,W,A,B\n\nif (W < 2*A .or. H < 2*B) then\n    write(*,*) -1\n    stop\nend if\n\ndo i =0, H-1\n    row = ''\n    do j = 0, W-1\n        if ( (i < B .and. j < A) .or. (i >= B .and. j >= A)) then\n            c = '0'\n        else\n            c = '1'\n        end if\n        ! append c to row\n        row = trim(row) // c ! but this requires allocation?\n    end do\n    write(*, \"(A)\") trim(row)\nend do\nend program main\n\nWait, but this may have an issue with the allocation of the row. Because in Fortran prior to 2003, you can't freely have reallocatable strings unless you do it with ALLOCATE. Since the user might be expecting standard Fortran 90 or similar, perhaps using a preallocated character array is better.\n\nAlternatively, for simplicity, using a fixed length array.\n\nSo let's go back to the first approach with a character array for each row:\n\nWithin the i loop, declare a character array of length W.\n\nInside the j loop, assign each character.\n\nThen write the array.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: H, W, A, B, i, j\ncharacter(len = W) :: row\n\nread(*,*) H, W, A, B\n\nif (W < 2*A .or. H < 2*B) then\n    print*, -1\n    stop\nend if\n\ndo i =0, H-1\n    row = ' '  ! Initialize all characters to something, but then overwrite each position.\n    do j =0, W-1\n        if ( (i < B .and. j < A) .or. (i >= B .and. j >= A) ) then\n            row(j+1:j+1) = '0'  ! since Fortran characters are 1-based\n        else\n            row(j+1:j+1) = '1'\n        end if\n    end do\n    write(*,fmt='(A)') trim(row)\nend do\n\nend program main\n\nWait but the initial 'row = ' ' ' command would set all characters to space. But then we overwrite every position, so it's okay. Alternatively, we could set it to '1's first, but then set to '0's where needed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, just set each position:\n\nAlternatively, doing that.\n\nWait, in the code, for each j, the if sets to '0' or '1', so initializing doesn't matter since all are overwritten.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nrow is initialized to spaces (but then for each j, replaced with 0 or 1). The initial setting to space is irrelevant since all characters will be written over.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps leave it unassigned, but that can cause undefined values. It's safer to initialize to something first.\n\nBut in practice, the loops will overwrite all elements.\n\nWait in Fortran, if you declare a character array as character(len=W) row, then assigning to each element would overwrite. So the initial 'row = ' ' ' is not necessary, but safer.\n\nWait no. If you just declare, the memory may contain undefined chars, but when setting each character via row(j+1:j+1) = ... then that's okay. So perhaps can even omit the initialization. But to avoid possibly leftover garbage, initializing is better.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nBut the write statement. The row is exactly length W. The format '(A)' will print the entire string (assuming row has W characters). But since we are using row(j+1:j+1), the characters are set correctly.\n\nWait, but the Fortran write statement with '(A)' will write the entire string, including trailing spaces? Because the variables are of length W, and we have set all characters, no.\n\nWait since for all positions we set each character to '0' or '1', then row(1:w) has all characters correctly, so trim is not needed. So write(*,*) row(1:w).\n\nAlternatively, write(*,'(a)') row.\n\nWait yes, since row is exactly of length W. So row will have exactly the correct length.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nWithin the i loop:\n\nrow = ' ' (but not necessary if we're setting all elements) \n\nWait let me considering:\n\nSuppose W is 3. Then row is a character of length 3. For j = 0 to 2.\n\nEach loop:\n\nWhen j=0: row(1:1) = '0' or '1'\n\nj=1 : row(2:2), etc. \n\nSo at the end, all elements are written.\n\nThus, the write is okay.\n\nThe other part is the Fortran main loop and variable declarations.\n\nWait the output would be correct?\n\nNow, the loops in Fortran start at 0, so the indices are correct as in Java.\n\nLet me check the condition again. The Java code's condition is:\n\nif (i < B && j < A) or (i >= B) && (j >= A) \u2192 then '0'.\n\nWait in code: (i < B and j < A) OR (i >= B and j >= A).\n\nYes, the condition is captured in the Fortran code: the if-then condition matches.\n\nNow another point: In Fortran, the loop 'do i=0, H-1' requires that H is at least 1. But in the problem statement's condition, if H is small enough (H < 2B), then the printing is done early, but if not, then the code proceeds. So in the loop, if H is okay, then H is at least 2B (since the check was already done), so H can be safely taken.\n\nAnother point: the original code in Java loops from 0-based indices, so that's same as the Fortran loops.\n\nTesting edge cases. Let's see, if H=2, B=1. Then for i from 0 to 1:\n\nB is 1. So i < B is for i=0 (0<1 \u2192 yes). i >= B (1 is 1, so >= B is equal.\n\nSo the condition is okay.\n\nNow, what about for H=1? H must be at least 2*B, so if B is 1, then H must be at least 2. So the input would be invalid.\n\nThe code will handle that.\n\nAnother case: W=2*A exactly. Then A is such that, e.g. W=2*A \u2192 e.g. W=4, A=2. So that's okay.\n\nNow the only remaining part is the allocate of the row array. Since the length W is read from input, we can't have a fixed-length array. Wait, in the current code, row is declared as 'character(len=W) :: row', but in Fortran 90, variable length can be problematic here. Wait no:\n\nWait, in the code as I wrote it above (previous version):\n\nThe variables H, W, A, B are declared as integers. So, in declarations, row is declared with a length of W.\n\nBut W is not known at compile time, so that would cause an error because you can't have a character of length equal to a variable in declarations.\n\nAh, right! Oh, right, that's a mistake.\n\nOops, I made a mistake there. The array declaration has to have a fixed length or be allocatable.\n\nBecause in declarations, the length must be a constant known at compile time. So if we want the length to be W (a variable), we have to use an allocatable array.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nUse a character array where the length is set dynamically. So, perhaps using an allocatable character array.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nWithin the loop over i, allocate a row of length W before, but need to know W before.\n\nWait, but W is known after reading it. The problem is that the array declarations must have a declared length, unless they're allocatable.\n\nSo the correct way is to make row an allocatable array.\n\nInside the do i loop, but better to allocate once.\n\nWait, better approach:\n\nAfter reading W, allocate the row array.\n\nLike:\n\nStart code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: H, W, A, B, i, j\ncharacter(len=1) :: c\ncharacter(len = :), allocatable :: row\n\nread(*,*) H, W, A, B\n\nif (W < 2*A .or. H < 2*B) then\n    write(*,*) -1\n    stop\nend if\n\nallocate(row(W))  ! making row an array of length W characters\n\ndo i=0, H-1\n   row = ' '    ! Initialize all to space, but then set each position\n   do j =0, W-1\n       if ( (i < B .and. j < A) .or. (i >= B .and. j >= A )) then\n           row(j+1) = '0'  ! since array is 1-based\n       else\n           row(j+1) = '1'\n       end if\n   end do\n   write(*,*) row   ! write the array? Need check. Alternatively, trim?\n\n   ! Alternatively, write *, trim(row(1:W))\nend do\n\ndeallocate( row)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, using allocatable arrays with length W is correct here.\n\nWait the code above:\n\nrow is declared as allocatable, and allocated to W characters long. So when we assign row(j+1) = ... that works.\n\nWait also, the assignment can be done directly:\n\nrow(j+1) = '0' or '1' because row is a character array with length W.\n\nWait in that case, '0' and '1' are single characters, so assigning to a single character (row(j+1)) is okay.\n\nBut then when writing the entire row: using write(*,*) row will print the entire array?\n\nWait no, when you do write(*,*) row, it would interpret the entire array as a character string. Since it is an allocatable character array of length W, the output should be the concatenated characters.\n\nWait let me test with an example. Suppose W=3, row(1) = '1', row(2)= '0', row(3) = '1', then 'write(*,*) row' should write '101'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an explicit format:\n\nwrite(*,'(a)') row(1:W)\n\nAlternatively, using a loop on the row. But the simplest way is perhaps write(*,*) row.\n\nWait in Fortran, when you write an array of characters, it might print them all connected, but let me see:\n\nYes, in Fortran, a character array can be treated as a string if it's a 1D array with characters of length 1, or a single character with length equal to the array's length? Hmm no, perhaps better to use row as a allocatable string.\n\nWait the declaration of 'character(len=:)... allocatable' can represent a single string of length W.\n\nWait let me think again:\n\nThe better approach is to have row as a 1D allocatable character array where each element is length 1. But more likely:\n\nThe allocatable declaration can be either a scalar (with variable length) or arrays, but better to do:\n\nrow is declared as character(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable. \n\nWait perhaps let me adjust the code.\n\nAlternatively, using a scalar character variable with an allocated length. \n\nWait let me correct the code:\n\nOption 1:\n\nUse a character*(*) array, but in fortran 90, it's better to use allocatable.\n\nLet me try:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: H, W, A, B\ninteger :: i, j\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: row  ! allocate to W elements, each a character of length1.\n\nread(*,*) H, W, A, B\n\nif (W < 2*A .or. H < 2*B) then\n    print*, -1\n    stop\nend if\n\nallocate(row(W))\n\ndo i =0, H-1\n\n   do j =1, W  ! wait confusion between 0 and 1\n      row( j ) = ' 'c\n   end do \n\n   do j =0, W-1\n       if ( (i < B .and. j < A) .or. (i >= B .and. j >=A) ) then\n           row(j+1) = achar(48)   ! '0'\n       else \n           row(j+1) = achar(49)   ! '1' \n       end if\n   end do\n\n   write(*,'(A)') row \n\nend do\n\ndeallocate( row )\n\nend program.\n\nWait here:\n\nWait the row indexes from 1 to W. The loop for j in the inner loop is from 0 to W-1 (as per Java), so j+1 maps to the row indices correctly.\n\nWait code points:\n\nThe row(j+1) is set based on j from 0 to W-1 \u2192 j+1 from 1 to W. That's correct.\n\nThen writing row as '(A)' \u2014 will the format write all characters in the array correctly?\n\nAlternatively, Using:\n\nThe array row is length W, so write *, (row(j), j=1,W) ?\n\nWait the format to write the row to a single line without space could be achieved using:\n\nwrite(*,fmt='(a)') row\n\nBut perhaps trying to use write(*,*) row will automatically output characters correctly.\n\nIn any case, testing would be needed. Alternatively, using write statement with the length and format:\n\nwrite(*,\"(a1)\") (row(j), j=1,W) \n\nBut that would write each character with an a1 format, each a single character, but the comma might separate by spaces, or, in some cases, line.\n\nAlternatively, using the format (a) to suppress that.\n\nWait perhaps the best is to use the following code.\n\nI think the key mistake earlier was the sizing of row. Let's use row as an array of size W.\n\nWait:\n\nDeclare:\n\nallocate(row(W)), but row is a 1-D array with elements of length 1.\n\nWait preferably, use:\n\ncharacter(len=1,kind=1) :: row(W)\n\nBut making it allocatable:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an array of characters each of length 1, but it's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, using a scalar character variable with length W, then building the string in a way.\n\nIn Fortran, a character variable of length W can be used:\n\nrow is a character variable of length W. Then, each position is set via row( j+1 : j+1 ) = '0' etc.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: H, W, A, B, i, j\ncharacter(len= : ), allocatable :: row\n\nread(*,*) H, W, A, B\n\nif ( W < 2*A .or. H < 2*B ) then\n    write(*,*) -1\n    stop\nend if\n\nallocate( character(len=W) :: row )\n\n do i =0, H-1\n    row = repeat(' ', W)  ! Initialize all spaces\n    do j=0, W-1\n        if ( (i < B .and. j < A) .or. (i >= B .and. j >=A) ) then\n            row(j+1:j+1) = '0' ! since 1-based, j+1 is the position.\n        else\n            row(j+1:j+1) = '1'\n        end if\n    end do\n    write(*, '(A)') row\n end do\n\ndeallocate(row)\n\nend program\n\nThis should work.\n\nWait in this case, row is a single string of length W. The line row(j+1:j+1) is a substring starting at j+1 and length1, so assigning the single character.\n\nYes, this approach is okay.\n\nAll right. Now, the 'repeat(' ', W)' is to fill the string with spaces (spaces can be overwritten), but since 'j' runs over all positions, all characters will be set to '0' or '1' anyway.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps even initializing to '1's first then changing to '0's.\n\nBut it's unnecessary, as the code correctly sets each character.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow the repeat function may not be available in some fortran versions. Alternatively, the code can write loop:\n\nBut for the initialization, an alternative is setting each element.\n\nBut repeat is convenient if available.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nrow = '1' // '1' ... etc. But perhaps in some Fortran versions it's better to use loop for initialization. But since it's not necessary (the condition will set all characters anyway), the initialization can be to any value.\n\nSo the current code works.\n\nNow testing the syntax:\n\n'row(j+1:j+1) = '0' \u2014 yes, in fortran this is correct.\n\nThe allocate statement is correct.\n\nThe deallocate after the loop.\n\nSo the final Fortran code should look like:\n\nAs above.\n\nSo the complete code would be as follows.\n\nWait let me also check the loops.\n\nThe loops are 0-based, which is correct.\n\nNow, the only thing left is to confirm the newlines. In the Java code, after each row the code does bw.newLine(), which adds a newline. In Fortran's write statement, the default for ' * ' in the format includes a trailing blank, but using the '(A)' format should suppress that. Or the default write(*,*) will end with a newline anyway.\n\nYes, each write(*, '(A)' ) row writes the entire row as a single line, and then a new line.\n\nHmm, the '(A)' control will treat the whole string as the character variable. The output would write the line, and newline is handled automatically.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final Fortran code should be this."
