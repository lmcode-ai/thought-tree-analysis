Wait the product n*m could be large, so we need to compute LCM as (n * m)/gcd_val, but since in JVM, integers are 32 bits unless using long. But in the Java code, the final line uses long for LCM. So likely, the LCM can be up to n*m which may need 64-bit integers. Thus, in Fortran, LCM should be stored as an 8-byte integer (integer(kind=8) or integer*8). Thus, the code:\n\nlcm_val = (n * m) / gcd_val But in Fortran, integer divisions may have issues if the division isn't exact. However, in our case, since n is divisible by gcd(n,m), so (n/gcd_val) is integer, so (n*m)/gcd = (n/gcd)*(m/gcd)*gcd_val, which is integer. So no issue. So now, putting all together.

Similarly for t's indices:\n\nfor k=0 \u2192 m/2*0 \u2192 0 \u2192 t(1) \n\nk=1 \u2192 6/2 *1 =3 \u2192 t(4). Suppose s is \"abcd\", t is \"a_xd\", then at the position 0:\n\ns(1)= 'a', t(1)= 'a' \u2192 okay.\n\nfor k=1, the s[3] is c, t(4) is 'd' \u2192 if s's third character is c and t's fourth is d, then okay if 'c' == 'd'?",

Alternatively, because LCM_val is of kind=8, so n and m are multiplied first, and then stored into an 8-byte variable. But if n*m overflows the default integer, then casting is necessary. Thus, to be safe, cast each to int(kind=8). Wait in code as written, perhaps the division is also an issue, but if gcd_val is multiply into the denominator, since (n*m) is an integer, but cast to 8-byte. Wait perhaps this is better: lcm_val = ( (n * m) / gcd_val ) But only if n*m can be computed as default integer without overflow, else use integer*8. so in code: lcm_val = (n * m) / gcd_val But if n and m are too big, then that's bad.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what this Java code does. Hmm, the problem seems to be checking whether two strings s and t can be merged without conflict when overlapped according to their GCD. Or maybe not exactly, but the core part is calculating the GCD of n and m, then checking each position in the overlapping part. If any characters at the corresponding positions differ, output -1; else, output the LCM of n and m. \n\nAlright, first, translating the main logic. Let's see the structure. The Java code uses the GCD to determine the number of overlapping points to check. For each k from 0 to gcd-1, they check if the characters at positions (k * n/gcd) in s and (k * m/gcd) in t are the same. If any of these are different, output -1. Otherwise, output LCM(n,m). \n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. Compute GCD of n and m. \n2. Compute LCM(n,m) which is (n*m)/gcd.\n3. Check for all k from 0 to gcd-1 if s[k*n/gcd] == t[k*m/gcd]. If any are not equal, return -1 else LCM.\n\nNow, how to do this in Fortran?\n\nFirst, handling input. Java uses a scanner, so in Fortran we'd read from the standard input, probably using READ(*,*) to get n, m. Then read s and t using something like READ(*, '(A)') s and same for t.\n\nNext, computing the GCD. Fortran has an intrinsic function for GCD? Wait, GCD is available from Fortran 2008, but maybe I should implement it explicitly to ensure compatibility if needed. Alternatively, use the INTER\u7684\u5b9e\u9645 function. Wait, checking Fortran's intrinsics: GCD(X,Y) is available as an intrinsic function starting from F2008. Let me confirm. Yes, GCD is an elemental function in Fortran 2008 which returns the greatest common divisor of |x| and |y|. So, if compiling with F2008 support, that's straightforward. Since the problem likely expects the absolute GCD, and since n and m in the problem are input as integers (presumably positive?), so we can just use the GCD function.\n\nWait, the Java code uses BigInteger.gcd, which for positive integers would give the standard GCD, so that's straightforward. So gcd can be computed as gcd = GCD(n,m).\n\nThen compute LCM: lcm = (n * m) / gcd. Since in Java, they use big integers, but in Fortran, with integers, but likely the n and m here are not too big (as per the problem constraints of the original problem, which I'm not sure, but in any case double math would be okay if necessary). The output can be a positive integer.\n\nNow, the main checking loop: For each k from 0 to gcd-1, check the characters:\n\nWait the indices in Java are zero-based. So in Fortran, strings are arrays with starting at 1, right? So need to be careful here. \n\nIn the Java code:\n\ns.charAt(k * n / gcd) \n\nWait, the positions are computed as (k * n / gcd). Since the loop runs from 0 to gcd-1, this gives positions that step through (n/gcd) every time. So n/gcd and m/gcd must be integers. Because when you divide n by gcd(n,m), you get the co-prime part of n, and same for m. \n\nSo in Fortran, for k from 0 to gcd-1, we need to check s( (k*(n/gcd)) + 1 ), but wait, strings in Fortran are indices starting at 1, so when k is 0, the first index is 0*(...) which is 0, which is invalid. Wait wait no, wait. Let's recheck:\n\nThe Java code uses s.charAt(index), where the index is calculated as (k * n/gcd). Because in Java, indices start at 0. So in Java, the first character is 0, so if the string s has length n, then s.length() = n? Wait in the code, n is the first input, but then s is the next input, maybe the problem expects that s is exactly length n and t is length m?\n\nIn the problem (though I don't see the problem, but given the code), the code reads s and t, so we can assume that the lengths are n and m, respectively. So s has length n, so indexes 0 to n-1, and t has m indexes 0 to m-1. \n\nBut in Fortran, strings are arrays where characters are from 1 to len. So when converting:\n\nIn the Java code, for position in s: k * n / gcd. Since the s's first character is s(0) in Java, which is the first character, but in Fortran s starts at 1, so the first character corresponds to Java's 0. So if in the code:\n\njava index: k*n/gcd corresponds to (Fortran index of) (k*n/gcd)+1.\n\nSo to get the same position, need to adjust by +1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose k is 0:\n\nJava s.charAt(0) is the first character.\n\nFortran s(1) is the first character.\n\nSo when translating the index: java index 0 is FORTRAN index 1. So to convert a Java index j into FORTRAN's, it's j + 1.\n\nThus, in Fortran code, when we have the character at position (k * n / gcd) in Java, which would be j = that value. In Fortran, it is converted to j+1.\n\nWait, so the character in s is s( (k * n/gcd) + 1 ), and similarly for t. \n\nWait but also, the loop runs up to gcd. Well, in Java: \n\nfor the loop \"IntStream.range(0, gcd)\" gives 0 to gcd-1. Because in Java, the second argument is exclusive, so in Fortran, k will run from 0 to gcd-1, inclusive. \n\nTherefore, in the loop, for each k from 0 to gcd-1:\n\ns_char = s( (k * n/gcd) + 1 )\n\nt_char = t( (k * m/gcd) +1 )\n\nWait, but for that, the terms (k * n/gcd) must be integers. Let's see:\n\nn divided by gcd(n,m) is n/(d) where d is gcd, so yes, because n is divisible by d.\n\nSimilarly m/gcd is integer. So for each k, multiplying by (n/gcd) gives an integer. So those indices are valid.\n\nSo the loop in Fortran would need to cycle through each k, compute the indices, check the characters. \n\nThe approach in Java is using an IntStream, which is a functional way, filtering those k where the characters differ. If any exists, then the findAny on the mapToLong(-1) gives -1. Else the LCM.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps the easiest way is to loop over k from 0 to gcd-1 (inclusive):\n\ndo k = 0, gcd-1\n\n   compute index in s: s_pos = (k * n / gcd) +1 \n\n   index in t: t_pos = (k * m / gcd) +1\n\n   if (s(s_pos) .ne. t(t_pos)) then\n\n      result = -1\n\n      exit loop\n\n   end if\n\nend do \n\nthen, if the loop completes without exit (i.e., all passed), output LCM, else -1.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFirst the declaration:\n\nprogram agc028_a \n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, gcd_val \n\ninteger :: k \n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s, t \n\ninteger :: lcm_val \n\nlogical :: possible = .true.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read s and t. The GCD is computed as gcd_val = gcd(n,m).\n\nWait but in Fortran, variables for GCD must be integers, and the GCD function is available as gcd in F2008. Let me check, yes: in Fortran 2008, GCD(I,J) returns the greatest common divisor. But assuming the compiler supports that. Otherwise, must write a helper function, but for now, perhaps just proceed with GCD.\n\nThen the code:\n\nread(*,*) n, m \n\ngcd_val = gcd(n, m) \n\n! Now read s and t, ensuring they are of length n and m respectively. Since in fortran, reading a string reads until the next whitespace, but the input must have the next two entries as exactly the strings. Wait need to read them using something like:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s \n\nread(*, '(a)') t \n\nWait but character variables need to be allocatable here. Alternatively:\n\nWe can use character(n) :: s and character(m) :: t, but then we have to know n and m first. Since in Fortran, variables are declared before their use. So perhaps use allocatable arrays. \n\nSo let me declare s and t as allocatable, with lengths n and m:\n\nBut in standard Fortran, you can do:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s, t \n\nbut then to allocate them:\n\nAfter reading n and m:\n\nallocate( character(n) :: s, character(m) :: t )\n\nWait no: first, need to read n and m. So perhaps better to read n and m first, then read the strings.\n\nWait steps in code:\n\nRead n, m from input (using read statement). \n\nCompute gcd(n,m). \n\nThen read s and t. So for reading the strings:\n\nBut in Fortran, when you want to read strings with variable lengths (since n and m can be up to ? whatever the problem specifies?), but the problem requires that s has exactly n characters and t has exactly m. So we can read with a format for s that reads exactly n characters, and same for t.\n\nWait using:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s \nBut this would read until the end of the line, but perhaps the actual input to the java code was scanner.next(), which reads the next token. So the code in Java uses scanner.next() which takes the next token. Wait, so the s is the next token (which is a string of length n?), but perhaps not. For example, possibly the next token (after scanning n and m) is s, and t is after that. \n\nWait the Java code:\n\nn = scanner.nextInt();\n\nm = scanner.nextInt();\n\ngcd = ... \n\ns = scanner.next()\n\nt = scanner.next()\n\nso, the code expects that after the two integers, the next two inputs are s and t, each as separate tokens (meaning separated by whitespace, but possibly not containing spaces).\n\nThus, in Fortran, the s and t can be read as:\n\nread(*,'(a)') s_line \n\nbut then extracting s and t from that? Wait no. Maybe better to read two lines, but probably, the Java code expects the entire next tokens. But in any case, in code translation, the same logic applies: after reading n and m, then read s, then read t, each as the next token. \n\nIn Fortran, how can we read the entire remaining input for a string? Alternatively, since the problem may have s and t on separate lines?\n\nWait in code, Java reads using scanner.next() twice, so each reads the next token, separated by whitespace. So, for example:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\nabc def\n\nThen s would be \"abc\", t \"def\".\n\nAlternatively, inputs can be given like 3 2 abcdef, then s= \"abc\", t=\"def\".\n\nThus, to read each string as the next token, perhaps using list-directed read, which in Fortran would be read(*, *) , where the strings may be read according to the format.\n\nWait in Fortran list-directed input, if you have:\n\nread (*,*) avariable \n\nFor a string variable, it would read a single token (delimited by whitespace). But the problem is that when reading into a string's array, how to handle the length.\n\nAlternatively, using a character array and reading with a read statement that reads the next token into it.\n\nSo, here's a better approach:\n\nDeclare s as a character(n) array, t as character(m) array. Since their lengths are n and m, respectively.\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger :: n, m\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s, t \n\nWait, but declarations have to be before any executable statements like read.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nFirst, read n and m, but then the variables s and t need to have length defined at compile time? No, because n and m are variables. Thus, probably use allocatable.\n\nHere's outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m\n\ninteger :: gcd_val, lcm_val\n\nlogical :: conflict\n\nread (*, *, iostat=) n, m \n\ngcd_val = gcd(n, m)\n\nallocate( character(len = n)::s, &\n\n          character(len = m)::t )\n\nread (*, '(a)') s \n\nread (*, '(a)') t \n\nBut wait, using this, for s and t to be read as the next two lines?\n\nWait, if the user input is as tokens on a single line, for example after the first line (n and m), the next line has 'abc def', then s would be 'abc' and t 'def'\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the read statements after reading n and m should use list-directed input:\n\nRead (*,*) s, t\n\nBut list-directed in Fortran reads tokens, but for character variables, each will read until next whitespace, and truncate or not? Well, perhaps setting the character arrays to proper length.\n\nThis might be more reliable. Let me think:\n\nAfter reading n and m, the code can allocate s as length n, t as m, then read in the next two tokens:\n\nSo:\n\nallocate( s(n) )\n\nallocate( t(m) )\n\nread (*, *) s, t \n\nWait but list-directed reads will supply each token to each variable. However, if the data runs over lines, it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, read first s:\n\nread (*, '(a)') s\n\nread (*, '(a)') t \n\nBut the '(a)' format reads the entire line, but maybe for the first read captures the entire line (including possible spaces), which might not be desired.\n\nAlternatively, using read (*, '(a)') s would read s as the entire remaining input up to the new line, so maybe better.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to read the rest of the line for s:\n\nWait but in the Java code, after the two ints, it's next() (so the s is the first token, then next() is t) So in Fortran, using list-directed read where s is the next token, t is the next.\n\nThus, when using the * format, it will read tokens in sequence, so:\n\nAfter reading n and m, the code can read s and t as non-allocated characters (since we can allocate after knowing n and m).\n\nWait, let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, variables must be declared. Let's try this:\n\nprogram agc028a\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m \n\ninteger :: gcd_val \n\ninteger *8 :: lcm_val \n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s, t \n\n! Read n and m first \n\nread (*,*) n, m \n\ngcd_val = gcd(n,m) \n\n! Allocate s and t \n\nallocate( character(n) :: s, character(m) :: t )\n\n! Read s and t \n\nread (*,*) s \n\nread (*,*) t \n\nThen, check the strings. Wait but after reading n and m, the next two reads for s and t may require that the next line after the initial is the strings.\n\nWait, the first read reads n and m from the first line, assuming inputs are given as such. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inputs n and m are followed by s and t as the two next inputs on the same or next lines. Using list-directed form, this should be okay. For example, if input is:\n\n3 2\n\nabc \n\ndef \n\nThen s gets 'abc', t gets 'def'.\n\nIf input is:\n\n3 2 abc def \n\nthen s is 'abc', t is 'def' (since the initial (n=3 and m=2) have been read, and the rest are read in sequence.\n\nBut since scanner.next() in Java would take token after token separated by whitespace, the Fortran code should read them as such. \n\nSo that approach could work. \n\nNow, once s and t are read, loop over each k from 0 to gcd_val -1:\n\ninitialize a flag, possible = .true.\n\nthen loop over k from 0 to gcd_val-1:\n\ncompute index_in_s = (k * n) / gcd_val \n\nsince n and gcd_val are integers, so their division gives an integer here.\n\nindex_in_s is the zero-based in Java, so in Fortran's s, the position is index_in_s +1.\n\nSame for index_in_t:\n\nindex_in_t = (k * m)/ gcd_val \n\nthen the character in s at (k*n / gcd_val + 1), check against t at (k * m / gcd_val +1). \n\nIf any of these are different, set possible to .false. and break.\n\nIn Fortran loop:\n\npossible = .true.\n\ndo k = 0, gcd_val-1\n\n    s_char_at_k = s( (k * n)/gcd_val + 1 )\n\n    t_char_at_k = t( (k * m)/gcd_val + 1 )\n\n    if (s_char_at_k /= t_char_at_k ) then \n\n        possible = .false.\n\n        exit \n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\nthen, if possible is true, compute lcm and output it, else output -1.\n\nThe LCM can be computed as LCM = (n * m) / gcd_val \n\nBut note that in Java, they use big integers which can handle large values. However, in Fortran, the n and m could be up to what? Since the problem likely has constraints like n and m up to, say, 1e18, but since in Fortran variables need to be at least 8 bytes (if using integers*8 or real). Wait the product n*m could be large, so we need to compute LCM as (n * m)/gcd_val, but since in JVM, integers are 32 bits unless using long. But in the Java code, the final line uses long for LCM. So likely, the LCM can be up to n*m which may need 64-bit integers. \n\nThus, in Fortran, LCM should be stored as an 8-byte integer (integer(kind=8) or integer*8). \n\nThus, the code:\n\nlcm_val = (n * m) / gcd_val \n\nBut in Fortran, integer divisions may have issues if the division isn't exact. However, in our case, since n is divisible by gcd(n,m), so (n/gcd_val) is integer, so (n*m)/gcd = (n/gcd)*(m/gcd)*gcd_val, which is integer. So no issue.\n\nSo now, putting all together.\n\nThe variables:\n\nAt the start:\n\ninteger :: n, m, gcd_val \n\nlogical :: possible \n\ninteger(kind=8) :: lc \n\nAlso, the final output is to print either -1 or the LCM.\n\nThus, code outline:\n\nprogram agc028A \n\nimplicit none \n\ninteger :: n, m \n\ninteger :: gcd_val \n\nlogical :: possible \n\ninteger(kind=8) :: lcm_val \n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s, t \n\nread *, n, m \n\ngcd_val = gcd(n,m) \n\nallocate( character(n) :: s, character(m) :: t ) \n\nread(*,*) s \n\nread(*,*) t \n\npossible = .true. \n\ndo k =0, gcd_val-1 \n\n    s_idx = (k * n)/gcd_val +1 \n\n    t_idx = (k * m)/gcd_val +1 \n\n    if ( s(s_idx) /= t(t_idx) ) then \n\n        possible = .false.\n\n        exit \n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\nif (possible) then \n\n    lcm_val = (n*m)/gcd_val \n\n    write(*,*) lcm_val \n\nelse \n\n    write(*,*) -1 \n\nend if \n\ndeallocate(s,t) \n\nend program \n\nWait but in Fortran, when using reallocated variables, but here, the s and t are allocatable and allocated before being read into. Also, the variables:\n\nWait s and t have to be exactly length n and m? Because otherwise, if the input strings are longer than that, an error would occur. But according to the problem statement, perhaps s has exactly length n and t has exactly length m, so if not, invalid input, but here presumably we can assume that the inputs are correct. \n\nNow, note that in Fortran, when you read a string into a character array, the excess characters are truncated or padded? \n\nWhen using read(*,*) for character variables, trailing spaces and such might be an issue, but in list-directed input, trailing blanks are discarded. But if the string is exactly n characters long, then it should fit.\n\nPossible problem: The strings may contain leading or trailing spaces, but the problem expects they don't. Assuming the test cases are correct.\n\nNow, test case consideration:\n\nSuppose n=3, m=2, s = 'aab', t='aba'\n\nWait the GCD of 3 and 2 is 1. So gcd_val=1. \n\nThus, loop runs from 0 to 0 (since gcd-1=0). Check k=0:\n\nn/gcd = 3/1 = 3. So for s, the index_in_s is (0*3 /1 ) --> 0, plus 1 becomes 1. \n\nSimilarly, m/gcd is 2, so index_in_t is 0*2/1=0, plus 1, so position 1 in t.\n\nSo s at position 1 is 'a'\n\nt at position1 is 'a'. so okay. \n\nThen possible remains true, so LCM is (3*2)/1 =6.\n\nThus output 6.\n\nAnother case where a conflict occurs. Suppose n=2, m=2, GCD(2,2)=2, so checking k=0 and 1.\n\nSuppose s is 'ab', and t is 'ba'.\n\nThen for k=0:\n\nindex_in_s is 0*(2/2) =0 \u2192 1st character 'a'.\n\nindex_in_t is 0*(2/2) \u21920, position 1. t(1)='b'.\n\nSo they are different \u2192 possible becomes false and exit\n\nSo output -1.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=4, m=6. GCD is 2. So check k=0 and 1.\n\nSuppose s has 4 chars: let the positions we need to check at steps:\n\nfor k=0: (0 * 4/2) =0 \u2192 s[1]\n\nk=1: 4/2 *1 =2 \u2192 s(3).\n\nSimilarly for t's indices:\n\nfor k=0 \u2192 m/2*0 \u2192 0 \u2192 t(1) \n\nk=1 \u2192 6/2 *1 =3 \u2192 t(4).\n\nSuppose s is \"abcd\", t is \"a_xd\", then at the position 0:\n\ns(1)= 'a', t(1)= 'a' \u2192 okay.\n\nfor k=1, the s[3] is c, t(4) is 'd' \u2192 if s's third character is c and t's fourth is d, then okay if 'c' == 'd'?\n\nWait, depends on what is the actual strings. Imagine the problem where the strings are 'abcd' and 'abba' for m=6? Not sure. Anyway the code should handle that.\n\nPotential edge cases: gcd=1, so only check the first characters.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, other edge cases:\n\nWhat when n=0 or m=0? Probably not, as per problem constraints.\n\nSo, in terms of Fortran code.\n\nWait also, Fortran uses .eqv. instead of ==? No, in Fortran for characters, comparing with /= is okay.\n\nWait variables s and t are character arrays, so s(s_index) is the character. Comparing them with the .ne. operator is correct.\n\nAnother point: the GCD function in Fortran is for integers. So variables n and m are integers, so yes.\n\nWait, in the code, possible is initialized as .true. and the loop proceeds. Also, the loop must run through all k from 0 to gcd-1.\n\nThe code would loop even after finding a conflict, but when it finds a conflict, it sets possible to false and exits. So the loop breaks. \n\nNow, for space allocation. \n\nWait, in allocatable variables, we must allocate them with the lengths, so after n and m are read. \n\nYes, the code as is does that.\n\nSo the Fortran code:\n\nNow, the code also needs to compute LCM as n*m / gcd. But integers might overflow. \n\nIn Fortran, variables must be of proper kind to store large integers. The variables n and m are of default integer kind (probably 4 bytes). But if their product is large, need to ensure that when calculating n*m, it doesn't overflow a 4-byte integer. \n\nBut in the code, the lcm_val is of kind=8 (so 64-bit), and when calculating (n*m) must also be done in 64 bit to avoid overflow.\n\nHow to do that in Fortran. \n\nAssuming that n and m are integers of 4-byte, but their product can be larger than 2^31 (if n and m are up to 1e9 each, then product is 1e18, which needs 64-bit).\n\nThus, to ensure that when multiplying n and m, the product is computed in 64 bits, we must cast them to the larger type.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nlcm_val = ( int(n, kind=8) * int(m, kind=8) ) / gcd_val \n\nBecause then n and m are converted to 8-byte integers first, so their product is 8-byte integer, which is divided by gcd_val (integer) via integer division.\n\nAlternatively, in the Fortran code, maybe just compute the product as (n*m). However, if n and m are as big as 1e9 each, then their product is 1e18, which requires a 64-bit integer. \n\nIn Fortran, if the default integer is 4 bytes, then 2^31 -1 is about 2e9. 1e9 * 1e9 is 1e18 which exceeds that, hence must use a double-length var. \n\nHence, in the LCM computation:\n\nlcm_val = ( n * m ) / gcd_val \n\nwould overflow if n and m are too big. \n\nHence, the correct approach is to cast to integer(kind=8):\n\nlcm_val = ( int(n, 8) * int(m,8) ) / gcd_val \n\nBecause then their product is in 8-byte, preventing overflow.\n\nThus, in the code, the line:\n\nlcm_val = (n*m)/gcd_val \n\nbecomes \n\nlcm_val = ( int(n, kind=8) * int(m, kind=8) ) / gcd_val \n\nBecause that way n and m are promoted to 8-byte integers before multiplying.\n\nAlternatively, because LCM_val is of kind=8, so n and m are multiplied first, and then stored into an 8-byte variable. But if n*m overflows the default integer, then casting is necessary.\n\nThus, to be safe, cast each to int(kind=8).\n\nWait in code as written, perhaps the division is also an issue, but if gcd_val is multiply into the denominator, since (n*m) is an integer, but cast to 8-byte.\n\nWait perhaps this is better:\n\nlcm_val = ( (n * m) / gcd_val ) \n\nBut only if n*m can be computed as default integer without overflow, else use integer*8.\n\nso in code:\n\nlcm_val = (n * m) / gcd_val \n\nBut if n and m are too big, then that's bad. \n\nTherefore, the correct code would cast the values to integer(8) first.\n\nThus, say:\n\nlcm_val = (int(n, 8) * int(m,8)) / gcd_val \n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus changing that part.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nFull code:\n\n    \nprogram agc028a\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, m, gcd_val\n  integer(kind=8) :: lcm_val\n  logical :: possible\n  character(len=:), allocatable :: s, t\n\n  read *, n, m\n  gcd_val = gcd(n, m)\n  allocate (character(n) :: s, character(m) :: t)\n  read(*,*) s\n  read(*,*) t\n\n  possible = .true.\n  integer :: k\n  do k = 0, gcd_val -1\n    integer :: s_idx = (k*n)/gcd_val + 1\n    integer :: t_idx = (k*m)/gcd_val +1\n    if (s(s_idx) /= t(t_idx)) then\n      possible = .false.\n      exit\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  if (possible) then\n    lcm_val = (int(n, kind=8) * int(m, kind=8)) / int(gcd_val, kind=8)\n    write(*,*) lcm_val\n  else\n    write(*,*) '-1'\n  end if\n\n  deallocate(s, t)\nend program agc028a\n\nWait a few things to fix here. \n\nFirst, the declaration of variables inside the do loop? No, in Fortran you can't. Wait in the loop, the 's_idx' and 't_idx' need to be declared before the loop.\n\nWait the code as written above has variables declared inside the do loop, but that's a syntax error in Fortran.\n\nThus, the corrected code would:\n\nNeed to declare s_idx and t_idx as integer variables before the loop.\n\nLet me rewrite.\n\nFull code:\n\nprogram agc028a\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, m, gcd_val\n  integer(kind=8) :: lcm_val\n  logical :: possible\n  integer :: k, s_idx, t_idx  ! declaring them before the loop\n  character(len=:), allocatable :: s, t\n\n  read *, n, m\n  gcd_val = gcd(n, m)\n  allocate (character(n) :: s, character(m) :: t)\n  read(*,*) s\n  read(*,*) t\n\n  possible = .true.\n  do k = 0, gcd_val -1\n    s_idx = (k * n)/gcd_val + 1\n    t_idx = (k * m)/gcd_val +1\n    if (s(s_idx) /= t(t_idx)) then\n      possible = .false.\n      exit\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  if (possible) then\n    lcm_val = (int(n, 8) * int(m,8)) / gcd_val  ! wait, but gcd_val is integer, but denominator...\n    ! To ensure all are 8-byte:\n    lcm_val = ( int(n,8)*int(m,8) ) / int(gcd_val,8)  \n    ! because gcd_val is an integer, converting to 8-byte\n  \n    write(*,*) lcm_val\n  else\n    write(*,*) -1\n  end if\n\n  deallocate(s, t)\nend program agc028a\n\nWait, but when computing the gcd_val, the integer division is okay as variables s and t's indices must be exact.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the double quotion marks around -1? The output can be written with just write(*, *) -1, like:\n\nwrite(*,*) -1\n\nYes, no need for quotes.\n\nWait the write statement for -1:\n\nThe output is a number, not a string, so the code can be:\n\nwrite(*, *) -1 \n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code now compiles.\n\nTesting possible errors:\n\nWait, the indices:\n\nExample when k is 0, (0 *n)/gcd_val =0 \u2192 s_idx=1. So correct.\n\nThe calculation (k*n/gcd_val) would be an integer?\n\nYes because n is divisible by gcd_val, so when divided, gives an integer.\n\nSame for (k*m)/gcd_val:\n\nsince m is divisible by gcd_val. So no problem.\n\nSo all indices are correct.\n\nWhat about if gcd_val is 1, then only k=0 is looped. \n\nThus, code should be okay.\n\nThus this is the final code."
