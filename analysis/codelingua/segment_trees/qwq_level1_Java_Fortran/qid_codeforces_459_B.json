The format can be written as: If min_val == max_val:\n\nWRITE(*, '(I0,1X,I0)') (max_val - min_val), INT(mins*(mins-1)/2, 8)\n\nBut since mins is already 8-byte, the product and division will also be 8, but to make sure the division is integer, we need to use integer division. Wait in the case where mins is 5, for example, 5*4/2 = 10. Wait the formula is mins * (mins-1)/2. Since mins is an integer(kind=8), this calculation must be done correctly.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe problem seems to involve reading an array of integers, sorting them, then calculating the minimum and maximum values. Then it counts how many times the min and max occur. Depending on whether min and max are the same, it calculates different results. The output is the difference between max and min, followed by either the product of their counts (if they're different) or a combination when they are the same.\n\nFirst, let me look at the Java code step by step.\n\nThe main function starts by reading N, then the array of integers. It sorts the array, so the first element is min and last is max. Then it counts the occurrences of min and max. If min equals max, the second number in the output is mins*(mins-1)/2, otherwise it's mins * maxs.\n\nNow translating this into Fortran. \n\nFortran is different in several ways. Let's see:\n\nVariables in Fortran are declared with types, and arrays are a bit different. Java uses 0-based arrays, but Fortran can be 1-based by default unless specified otherwise. The code uses arrays starting at index 0 in Java, but in Fortran, the first index is 1. So need to adjust that when handling the min and max.\n\nFirst step: Read N. In Java, the Scanner reads input. In Fortran, perhaps using read(*,*) to get input from stdin. \n\nWe need to read N first, then an array of size N integers.\n\nSorting the array: In Java, it's done with Arrays.sort(). In Fortran, we can use the MSort routine, or perhaps a built-in sort. Wait, Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort like that in standard syntax. Hmm. Alternatively, we can use the ISORT function in Fortran? Or write a subroutine to sort the array.\n\nWait, maybe the simplest way here is to use the built-in sort provided by some module, or perhaps just use the radix sort or something else. Hmm. Maybe better to use a shell sort or bubble sort, but that might be inefficient. Alternatively, the code can use the SELECTED_REAL_KIND function? Wait, no. For an array of integers, I can use the Mergesort or some other method. Alternatively, let me think: in Fortran 90 or later, perhaps there is an intrinsic sort function.\n\nLooking up: Fortran has the built-in function \"SORT\". Wait, yes, in Fortran 95 and later, there is the \"SORT\" function available in the ISO standard, but it applies to intrinsic types. Let me confirm: the function is called ISORT or ?SORT for integers. Wait, the sort function is available via specific intrinsic functions. For an array of integers, you can use the function ISORT? Or maybe the array has a sort method. Wait, maybe the procedure is to do something like CALL M_SORT(a), but I might have to look up the correct syntax.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the 'SORT' subroutine. Maybe like:\n\nCALL QSORT(a) but that's not standard. Hmm. Alternatively, in Fortran, real(8) array can be sorted using the qsort intrinsic? I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look up: How to sort an array in Fortran 90.\n\nAh right. From what I remember, in Fortran 90, you can use the Fortran intrinsic subroutine 'SORT' via the 'SORT' function. Wait, actually, the generic name, such as:\n\nIn Fortran, there are elemental functions but for sorting an entire array, perhaps the easiest way is to use the built-in function. Let me check:\n\n Yes, for an integer array, you can do:\n\nCALL QSort(A, A) but that might not be the standard way.\n\nWait perhaps the correct way is to use the inquiry function via ISO standards, but maybe the safest way here is to implement a simple sort, but in the context of code submission, perhaps the code should use the sort function provided in a specific way. Alternatively, the array can be passed to the internal sort. Wait, maybe in some repositories, but perhaps a better way.\n\nAlternatively, here's the easiest way. Let me see:\n\nIn Fortran, to sort an array, use the SELECTED_INT_KIND and then perhaps use the BUBBLE SORT. For the problem, since the code must read and sort an array of integers, perhaps it's easier to implement a sorting algorithm here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code expects that in Fortran, there's an inbuilt sort. Wait, in Fortran 95 and beyond, we can use the \"SORT\" intrinsic function.\n\nWait, let me recall: The description from the Fortran documentation states that the 'SORT' intrinsic function on an array will return a new array sorted in ascending order. But, in order to do that, you can do:\n\nA = SORT(A)\n\nWait, if that's the case. For integer arrays, the function ISORT is used. Let me check.\n\nActually, if you have an array:\n\ninteger, dimension(5) :: a = [3,1,4,2,5]\n\nthen a_sorted = sort(a) \n\nwould give [1,2,3,4,5]. So that would be for a 64-bit integer or something? Wait, but actually, Fortran has sort as an intrinsic for certain kinds. The sort function is generic and works with different types. \n\nYes, in Fortran, from F95 onward, the intrinsic function SORT is available. So that's great. So the code can sort A using A = SORT(A). Well, but in Fortran arrays are passed by reference, so perhaps you have to make a copy? Maybe I need to test. Wait, the syntax is:\n\narray = sort(array)\n\nYes, this will sort the array, returning a new array which is then assigned back. \n\nSo in the code, after reading the array, we can sort it with:\n\nA = sort(A)\n\nWhich would sort the integers in ascending order.\n\nThat simplifies things a lot. So, the first step is to read N, then the array A, then sort A.\n\nNext step: the first element of the sorted array is A(1) (since in Fortran arrays are 1-based unless specified otherwise). The last element is A(N). \n\nThen initialize min and max as A(1) and A(N). \n\nThen count how many times the min occurs (mins) and how many times the max occurs (maxs). \n\nLoop through all elements of A and increment counters when the value equals min or max. \n\nThen, if min == max, then output (max - min) followed by (mins choose 2) since all elements are the same. The formula is n(n-1)/2. \n\nElse, the second number is mins*maxs, as the product of their counts. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran code. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, Declare variables.\n\nThe program can be written as a main program (no classes in Fortran, so no need for class codeforces_459_B).\n\nStart with PROGRAM codeforces_459_B. Then variables:\n\n- N is an integer.\n\n- A is an array of integers, with size N. However, in Fortran, arrays can be dynamic using allocatable. So perhaps read N first, then allocate A.\n\nFortran doesn't have dynamic arrays in older versions, but in Fortran 90+, you can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nRead N.\n\nAllocate an integer array A of size N.\n\nRead N integers into A.\n\nSort A via A = sort(A).\n\nCompute min and max as A(1) and A(N).\n\nThen, count mins and maxs:\n\nInitialize mins and maxs to 0.\n\nLoop over all elements:\n\n   if (A(i) == min) mins = mins +1\n\n   if (A(i) == max) maxs = maxs +1\n\nThen determine the output.\n\nNow, the output has two numbers separated by a space.\n\nIn Fortran, use the write statement.\n\nAlso note that in Fortran, integers can be declared with optional kind parameters, but the problem likely requires default integers. Java uses int which is 32 bits. The code's variables for min, max, mins, maxs can all be 32-bit. In Fortran, integer(kind=4) maybe.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps declare them as default integers (kind=4 should be okay).\n\nFortran source:\n\nNow the code.\n\nFirst, the basic outline:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_459_B\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  INTEGER :: N, i\n  INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: A(:)\n  INTEGER :: min_val, max_val\n  INTEGER :: mins, maxs\n  ! Read N\n  READ(*,*) N\n  ! Allocate array\n  IF (N <=0) THEN\n    ! but assuming N is given correctly as per problem's description\n    ! Probably code can proceed without error checking\n    STOP\n  ENDIF\n  ALLOCATE(A(N))\n  ! Read the array elements\n  READ(*,*) (A(i), i = 1,N)\n  ! Sort the array\n  A = SORT(A)\n  ! Compute min and max\n  min_val = A(1)\n  max_val = A(N)\n  ! Initialize counters\n  mins = 0\n  maxs = 0\n  ! Loop and count\n  DO i = 1, N\n     IF (A(i) == min_val) THEN\n        mins = mins +1\n     ENDIF\n     IF (A(i) == max_val) THEN\n        maxs = maxs +1\n     ENDIF\n  ENDDO\n  ! Determine the case and output\n  IF (min_val == max_val) THEN\n    ! All elements are the same\n    WRITE(*,*) (max_val - min_val), \" \", mins*(mins-1)/2\n    ! Or better: using format\n    WRITE(*, '(I0,1X,I0)') (max_val - min_val), mins*(mins-1)/2\n  ELSE\n    WRITE(*, '(I0,1X,I0)') (max_val - min_val), mins * maxs\n  ENDIF\n  ! Deallocate array\n  DEALLOCATE(A)\nEND PROGRAM codeforces_459_B\n\nWait, but Fortran's sort function might return in a different way? For instance, in some cases, but according to the standard, it should sort the elements in ascending order.\n\nA note: The function sort() returns an array sorted in ascending order. So A = sort(A) is correct.\n\nNow, some details:\n\n- The input for the array: the code uses READ(*,*) (A(i), i=1,N). The READ statement here should read all elements in one line, assuming that the input is space-separated. In Java, the Scanner reads all in one line.\n\nBut in Fortran, the READ statement with list-directed input (the * format) should handle that. The (A(i), ... ) construct reads each element in sequence.\n\n- The compute min and max: since the array is sorted, A(1) is min and A(N) is max.\n\n- The counters: initialize to zero before the loop.\n\n- The output: need to write two integers separated by space. The WRITE with a format Using '(I0,1X,I0)' is suitable. The I0 format is a variable width. Alternatively, one could use * for free format.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"Print\" in Java with a space. In Fortran's free-format output.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, integers can be default kind. The variables N, mins, maxs etc can be integer unless the numbers are too big. But given the problem's constraints, probably okay.\n\nWait, but the counts (mins and maxs) could be up to N, which can be large, but in Java, using int is okay, and in Fortran, integer is generally 32-bit, but with a problem where N could be up to 1e5 or similar? But let's assume the code is okay.\n\nWait, in this code, the problem isn't stated but given the original Java code, probably N can be up to 1e5 but with constraints not given here. Using 32-bit integers (default in Fortran) should be okay.\n\nIn Fortran, if the calculation mins * maxs is potentially large, the product could exceed 32 bits, but in Java it's done as a long (64 bit). Since the output requires that number, we need to handle possible 64-bit integers for the second term.\n\nWait the original Java code uses long for mins and maxs. So mins and maxs are of type long. Because, for example, if N is 1e5 and mins is 1e5, min*max would be 1e10, which is under 2e9 (but over if it's a bigger N, but assuming the problem allows it. So in Fortran, since mins and maxs are integers (default 4 bytes) but the product can be up to (1e5)^2 =1e10, which is more than 2^31 (~2e9), so 32 bit integers won't hold that. Oh! That's a problem.\n\nWait so the original code uses Java's long, but in Fortran, we have to use a wider integer. Let me see.\n\nIn the Java code, mins and maxs are declared as integers, but the product is stored in a 'long' variable? Wait the counts are stored in mins (int) and maxs (int). But when calculating mins * maxs, the result could be up to N*N. For N up to, say, 2e5, that's 4e10, which can fit into a 32-bit signed integer? No, because 2^31 is ~2e9, so 4e10 is way bigger. Wait 2^32 is about 4e9? 2e9 is 2^31, so 4e10 exceeds that. So in the original Java code, the result is stored in a long, which is 64 bits and okay.\n\nThus in Fortran, we need to ensure that mins and maxs are of a type that can hold their multiplicatoin. So using kind=8 (64 bits) integers for the variables involved in multiplication.\n\nWait, the code variables:\n\nIn Java the variables mins and maxs are of type int, but their product can be very large. So the code in Java stores the count variables as int, but when calculating mins*maxs (to compute the product) requires long.\n\nThus in Fortran, to avoid overflow, we need the variables mins and maxs to be of a 64-bit integer.\n\nWait, but the counts can be up to N (if all elements are min and/or max). So for N up to let's say 1e5, the product is 1e10, which is about 2^33.5. So for 32 bits, the product will overflow. So to prevent that, we must use INTEGER*8 (8-byte integers) in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran we can declare mins and maxs as 8-byte integers.\n\nSo changing variable declarations:\n\nmins and maxs can be declared as INTEGER*8 (or in Fortran terms, using kind=8) to store up to 2e18 or so. Because 1e5 * 1e5 is okay, but if N is up to 2e5, that's 4e10 which is 2^35, so 64 bits needed.\n\nThus, in Fortran code:\n\nVariables mins and maxs would have to be 64-bit integers. \n\nSimilarly, the variables for the result terms.\n\nTherefore adjusting the code:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_459_B\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  INTEGER :: N, i\n  INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: A(:)\n  INTEGER :: min_val, max_val\n  INTEGER(kind=8) :: mins, maxs\n  ! ... the rest remains same, except:\n\nWait initializing mins and maxs to 0, but with 8-byte integers. \n\nAlso, the write statement needs to print the result as integers. Because the Java code outputs the difference in the first number as (max - min) which is also integer (so fits in 32 bits, assuming array elements are 32-bit integers).\n\nSo, in the output:\n\nThe first value is (max_val - min_val), which is a 4-byte integer. The second value is mins * maxs, which is 8-byte. So how do we print both?\n\nBecause when using \"I0\" format in Fortran, it should auto-format, but need to ensure that the calculation of mins*maxs is an integer(kind=8).\n\nSo in the code, mins and maxs are integers(8), so their product is also 8 bytes.\n\nThus the write statement should output numbers as integers.\n\nThe format can be written as:\n\nIf min_val == max_val:\n\nWRITE(*, '(I0,1X,I0)') (max_val - min_val), INT(mins*(mins-1)/2, 8)\n\nBut since mins is already 8-byte, the product and division will also be 8, but to make sure the division is integer, we need to use integer division. Wait in the case where mins is 5, for example, 5*4/2 = 10.\n\nWait the formula is mins * (mins-1)/2. Since mins is an integer(kind=8), this calculation must be done correctly. Because for example, mins*(mins-1) may be even or odd? Since for any integer n, n*(n-1) is even (one of them is even).\n\nThus, the division is exact. However, in Fortran, when dividing integers, it uses integer division if both operands are integer. \n\nSo the expression mins*(mins-1)/2 would be correct as integer(8).\n\nSimilarly, mins * maxs is integer(8).\n\nSo the write statements can be:\n\nWRITE(*, '(I0,1X,I0)') max_val - min_val, mins*(mins-1)/2\n\nand\n\nWRITE(*, '(I0,1X,I0)') max_val - min_val, mins * maxs\n\nSince the first term is an integer, the second term is kind=8, but the WRITE statement can handle them. Alternatively, converting the first term to integer(8), but since it's small, it's not needed.\n\nPutting all together, the correct declarations are needed for mins and maxs.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nThe variables for mins and maxs must be declared as kind=8.\n\nThus:\n\nINTEGER :: N, i\n\nINTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: A(:)\n\nINTEGER ::min_val, max_val\n\nINTEGER(kind=8) :: mins, maxs\n\nThen initializing them to zero:\n\nmins = 0_8\n\nmaxs = 0_8\n\nWait in Fortran, when initializing to zero:\n\nWell, since they're declared as kind=8, initializing via 0 (default 4) will be okay since 0 is converted. Alternatively, using 0_8.\n\nBut perhaps safe practice to set them as integers of the correct kind.\n\nThus:\n\nmins = 0\n\nmaxs = 0 \n\nis also okay since 0 is promoted.\n\nWait in Fortran, when you assign an integer literal to a kind=8 variable, it will use the value.\n\nSo the code:\n\nIn the DO loop:\n\neach time:\n\nif A(i) is equal to min_val, add 1 to mins. (so increasing the count)\n\nSimilarly for max_val and maxs.\n\nThe loop:\n\nDO i = 1, N\n\n   IF (A(i) == min_val) THEN\n\n      mins = mins +1\n\n   ENDIF\n\n   IF (A(i) == max_val) THEN\n\n      maxs = maxs +1\n\n   ENDIF\n\nENDDO\n\nWait, but note that the same element can be both min_val and max_val (when all elements are same), so in that case, the ifs are both true. Not a problem.\n\nThen, the output lines:\n\nWhen min_val == max_val:\n\nThe formula is mins*(mins-1)/2, which for integers is okay.\n\nIn Fortran, the expression is evaluated as:\n\nmins = kind(8) variable. So (mins-1) is 8-bit, the division by 2 is integer division, as required.\n\nElse:\n\nmins * maxs (both 8-bit)\n\nThus, the code will correctly compute the required values.\n\nNow writing the Fortran code:\n\nPutting all together:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_459_B\nIMPLICIT NONE\nINTEGER :: N, i\nINTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: A(:)\nINTEGER :: min_val, max_val\nINTEGER(kind=8) :: mins, maxs\n\n! Read N\nREAD(*,*) N\n\nALLOCATE(A(N))\nREAD(*,*) (A(i), i = 1, N)\n\n! Sort the array\nA = Sort(A)\n\nmin_val = A(1)\nmax_val = A(N)\n\nmins = 0_8\nmaxs = 0_8\n\nDO i = 1, N\n   IF (A(i) == min_val) THEN\n      mins = mins + 1_8\n   ENDIF\n   IF (A(i) == max_val) THEN\n      maxs = maxs + 1_8\n   ENDIF\nENDDO\n\nIF (min_val == max_val) THEN\n   WRITE(*, '(I0,1X,I0)') (max_val - min_val), (mins * (mins - 1_8) / 2_8)\nELSE\n   WRITE(*, '(I0,1X,I0)') (max_val - min_val), (mins * maxs)\nENDIF\n\nDEALLOCATE(A)\nEND PROGRAM codeforces_459_B\n\nWait, some notes here. The constants added as _8 because the variables are kind=8. So for 1 it is necessary? \n\nIn the calculation of (mins -1), if mins is integer(8), then 1 can be treated as integer default. But better to cast as 1_8?\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, when you add an integer(kind=8) variable and an integer (default kind), the latter is promoted to the same kind as the variable. \n\nFor example, variable mins is integer(8), so mins +1 (1 is integer default) will result in an integer(8) computation. So the 1 can be represented as 1 kind=8 but it's not necessary.\n\nSo, in code, it can be written as:\n\nmins = mins + 1 (as integer default 0 is okay. Since mins is integer(kind=8), adding 1 (as 4-byte but promoted to 8) will be okay.\n\nHowever, I explicitly put _8 to ensure. Not necessary, but it's an option.\n\nAlternatively, let's write as:\n\nmins = mins + 1_8\n\nto make it explicit. Or leave it as is? The compiler would have no problem.\n\nNow, for division 6: when min and max are the same, it's (mins-1)*mins/2. Since the product of two integers of kind 8 will be divided by 2 (integer literal, default is 4, but again, the division is okay as long as the number is even.\n\nBut to make clear that the division is integer division, it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\n( mins * (mins-1) ) / 2\n\nSo the Fortran code above should work.\n\nTesting some cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSample input let's say N=3, [5,5,5]\n\nAfter sorting [5,5,5]\n\nmin =5, max=5.\n\nmins =3, maxs=3. \n\nOutput should be (0) followed by 3*2/2 = 3* (so 0 3). \n\nThe code should compute that: 5-5=0, and 3*(3-1)/2= 3*2/2 = 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nN=3, values [1,3,3]\n\nmin is 1, max 3.\n\ncounts: mins =1, maxs=2.\n\nsince min != max, output (3-1)=2, and 1*2=2 \u2192 so 2 2.\n\nThus output is \"2 2\".\n\nAnother test case: N=2, [1,2]. (difference 1, counts 1 each, so product 1*1=1 \u2192 1 1.\n\nYes.\n\nPossible error points in code:\n\n- The array initialization. The READ statement for the array may need to be in a free format. The code in Fortran:\n\nREAD(*,*) (A(i), i=1,N)\n\nThis is correct because in list directed I/O, the rest of the line after N is read into the array elements.\n\nAnother possible error: the sort function may be case sensitive. The function is sort(A), and if not found. Wait, is the sort function intrinsic?\n\nI think in Fortran, the sort function is available in F95 and up, but perhaps it's in the intrinsic module*. Or is it in some module?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken about the sort being an intrinsic function. Then, this could be a problem. If the Fortran compiler does not have the sort function, then the code won't work. \n\nOh wait, this might be a big mistake here.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the intrinsic function for sorting arrays is actually not available until a certain standard. Let me check again.\n\nAccording to the Fortran 2003 and later standards, the \"SORT\" function is available. But in some compilers, perhaps it's not enabled by default. For example, in GNU Fortran (gfortran), the INTRINSIC sort may not exist.\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nLooking up the gfortran documentation: \n\nThe function 'SORT' is indeed available in Fortran 2003, and is intrinsic. The man page of gfortran says that it can sort arrays. \n\nYes, the function:\n\nThe `SORT` function returns an array of the same kind and rank of array, with elements in ascending order. The `RANK` function is related but not needed here.\n\nThus, using A = sort(A) should work in gfortran.\n\nWait, let me check the Fortran 2003 specs.\n\nYes, the generic function named `SORT` is part of the intrinsic function, which can be used on arrays of integer, real, and other types. So yes, the code using A = sort(A) is correct.\n\nThus the code should work with a modern Fortran compiler (assuming F95 or later, and that it supports the sort intrinsic).\n\nAnother point is that in some compilers, the sort may be considered a module, but I believe the function is standard.\n\nAnother check: the array allocation. If N is zero, but according to the problem's constraints, N is given (like in Codeforces problems, usually N is positive).\n\nSo no code is needed for that here.\n\nThus, the above code should work. Therefore this is the Fortran translation."
