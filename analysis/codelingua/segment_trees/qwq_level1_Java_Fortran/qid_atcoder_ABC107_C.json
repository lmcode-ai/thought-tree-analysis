Wait in the first case inside the if statement of the loop:\n\ntemp = min( (2*(-min_val) + max_val), ( (-min_val)+2*max_val) ) Wait but in Fortran, the MIN function takes two integers here. Yes. So that can be written as temp = min( (2*(-min_val)+max_val), ( -min_val + 2*max_val ) ) Wait but parentheses might be important here. So to compute both expressions, and then take their minimum. Wait in the code the expressions are:\n\nFirst term: 2*(-min_val) + max_val\n\nSecond term: (-min_val) + 2*max_val \n\nYes. So in that case:\n\ntemp = min( 2*(-min_val) + max_val ,  (-min_val) + 2*max_val )\n\nWait need to make sure the terms are calculated before passed to MIN. So that part is okay. Wait in Fortran, the MIN function can be intrinsic. So Fortran's MIN is okay for that.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this Java to Fortran translation. Hmm, the code is for a problem from AtCoder ABC107, problem C. I need to make sure I understand what the code does before translating it, because sometimes direct translation can miss the logic if the structures are different.\n\nFirst, looking at the Java code structure. The main function reads N and K from input, then an array S of N integers. Then there's some processing depending on K being 1, N-K not zero, or else (probably when N equals K). \n\nThe first case where K==1: It's looping through each element in S, calculating the absolute value of each S[i], and keeping the minimum of all those absolute values. Then print it. That's straightforward.\n\nThe second case is when N-K is not zero (so K is less than N). For each i from 0 to N-K (so that the window of K elements is within the array?), they take the min (at position i) and max (i+K-1?) but wait, the code assumes that the array is sorted? Wait, wait, looking at S[i], and S[i + K -1]. Wait, in Java code's S array, the elements are read from input in order. Are they supposed to be sorted? The problem might involve choosing K elements from the array such that the values are consecutive or something, but I might not need to figure out the problem logic; I just need to translate the code accurately.\n\nWait the code is taking the first and last element of a group of K elements. Wait, perhaps the array is already sorted? Because otherwise, taking the first and last element as min and max would only make sense if the array is sorted. So maybe the problem expects S to be already sorted, so that in each window of K elements (since the code uses i as a starting point and considers i to i+k-1), the min and max can be the first and last elements of that window. So assuming that the code's input is S sorted in some order, like in the problem statement, maybe the input is given as numbers in a sorted list. \n\nThe problem probably requires finding the minimum possible value of some calculation over all possible consecutive K-length segments of the sorted array. The code's logic for each window (assuming sorted array) computes either between min and max, based on their signs.\n\nSo the translation steps would be replicating the same logic in Fortran.\n\nNow, translating the Java code structure into Fortran:\n\nJava uses Scanner, so in Fortran we need to read N and K from standard input, then the array S. \n\nIn Fortran, arrays are indexed starting from 1 by default, but can be set. But Java uses 0-based. So need to be careful here.\n\nWait Java code: the S array is 0-based. For example, in the K==1 loop, the indices go from 0 to N-1, so S has size N. Then in the N-K case: for i from 0 to N-K. So in Fortran, to replicate the indices correctly, perhaps the array in Fortran will be 1-based, so we can have N elements from 1 to N.\n\nVariables in the Java code:\n\n- temp initialized to 0, but in the loops, it's reassigned. The ans starts with a big value (1e9). The Fortran equivalent should be initializing ans to a large number, like 1e9 or something.\n\nNow, code translation steps:\n\nFirst, the input part. In Fortran:\n\nYou can open standard input as unit 5, but sometimes programs can just read from 'read *, variables'.\n\nBut in the main block:\n\nThe Java main function reads N and K, then S array. So in Fortran, maybe a program like this:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC107_C\n   implicit none\n   integer :: N, K, i, j, temp, ans\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: S\n   ...   \n   ! Read N and K\n   read(*,*) N, K\n   allocate( S(N) ) \n   read(*,*) (S(i), i=1,N)\n\nBut since Java's S is 0-based, but in fortran it starts at 1, so the indices are 1..N, so the loop in 'K=1' case:\n\nJava's for(int i=0; i < N; i++) corresponds to fortran i=1,N.\n\nNow the first case when K ==1:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++)\n    temp = S[i]\n    ans = min( abs(temp), ans )\n\nIn fortran:\n\ndo i=1, N\n   temp = S(i)\n   ans = min( abs(temp), ans )\nend do\n\nBut first we need to set ans to a large value, like ans= 1e9. Wait in Fortran, how to represent 1e9? It's an integer. 10**9 is 1000000000. So initializing ans as 1000000000.\n\nWait in Java, the 'ans' is initialized to 1000000000. So in Fortran:\n\nans = 1000000000\n\nIf K is 1 then compute that.\n\nThe second case is when N-K !=0, i.e., when N > K, I think. Because else branch is N-K ==0? Because else, it's probably when K=N.\n\nWait the code in the original is \"if (K == 1)\" then ... else if (N-K !=0). Else says when K !=1 and N-K ==0.\n\nWhich would mean when N = K and K !=1.\n\nSo the code for when N-K is not zero (i.e., the else if block) is when K is not 1 and N is more than K.\n\nWait in Java's else if (N - K !=0) : but if K is 1 and N-K = N-1. Then the first condition would have triggered. So this else if is for when K is greater than 1 and N-K is not zero. So N >=K?\n\nWait, but if N=K, then N-K=0, so it would go into the else clause. So the else clause is when N=K and K is not 1 (since K=1 would have been handled).\n\nIn the else if block (when N-K !=0), the loop runs from i=0 to (N - K) inclusive? Because in Java, for (int i = 0; i <= N-K; i++) ?\n\nWait N-K is the upper limit? So, in terms of number of iterations, that's (N - K +1) times, because inclusive.\n\nIn Java, the start is 0, end is N-K. So in Fortran, since the array S is indexed from 1 to N, the loop would need to be from 1 to (N-K + something?), wait let me see:\n\nJava code for the else if loop:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= N-K; i++) ... \n\nIn Java, S[i] and S[i + K -1]\n\nBut in fortran, the array is 1-based. So for the i in Java starts at 0:\n\nIn Fortran, to get the same starting point, when i=0 (Java) corresponds to the first element (since that was S[0]), in Fortran's 1-based that is i=1? Not quite.\n\nWait perhaps it's best to adjust variables so that the loop in Fortran is from the appropriate starting point.\n\nHmm, to make sure that the indices correspond correctly, perhaps:\n\nIn the else if clause (N-K !=0):\n\nIn Fortran's fortran, the loop's i should go from 1 to (N - K +1), because in Java's terms, that's from 0 to N-K. (N-K+1 terms?)\n\nWait Java's loop variable varies from 0 to (N-K) inclusive, which is N-K+1 times. The maximum is N - K. So in fortran, to do the same, but the array indices starting at 1, perhaps the loop is from 1 to (N-K+1) ?\n\nWait, let me think with numbers:\n\nSuppose in Java N=5 and K=2. Then N-K is 3. The loop i from 0 to 3 (4 terms: 0,1,2,3). So the starting index of the window is i, ending at i+1 (since K=2 terms, so the elements S[i] and S[i+1]).\n\nIn fortran, the indices are 1-based. So to have i in fortran from 1 to (N-K+1). In this example, N-K+1 would be 5-2 +1=4. The loop runs i=1,2,3,4. Then the first element is S(i) (1-based) and the second S(i+1). So that corresponds exactly to the original Java's S[i], S[i+1].\n\nSo in the Fortran loop, for the else if (N-K !=0) case, the loop would be i from 1 to (N-K+1). That would cover all possible windows of K elements.\n\nWait let me verify:\n\nJava's i starts at 0, increments up to N-K (which when N-K = (5-2) =3). So the last i is 3: window starts at 3*1? Wait indices in Java are 0-based. So with N=5, K=2, window starting at 3 (Java's index 3 is the fourth element), and the window is elements at 3 and 4 in java's array, i.e., the fourth and fifth elements. Which in a fortran array 1-based would be positions 4 and 5. \n\nIn fortran's loop, when i=4 (fortran loops to 4 when N-K+1=4), then S(i) and S(i+1) is fortran indices 4 and5, which matches.\n\nYes, that works. So the loop in Fortran for that case would be do i = 1, N-K+1, loop.\n\nNow the variables in each iteration:\n\nmin and max variables? In the Java code, min and max are set to S[i] and S[i+K-1], but since the array is assumed to be sorted, the first element is the smallest in the window and the last is the largest. So in Fortran, for each window starting at i, the first element is S(i), the K elements are up to S(i+K-1). Hence min = S(i), max = S(i+k-1).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nmin_val = S(i)\n\nmax_val = S(i + K -1)\n\nThen proceed as in Java's code. \n\nThen the conditional: if min_val <0 and max_val >0, compute some specific calculation, else take max of absolute values.\n\nIn Fortran, Math.abs() is ABS(), min and max can be done with the MIN and MAX functions. The condition \"min <0\" is min_val <0.\n\nThe computations in the first case (if min <0 and max_val>0) are:\n\ntemp = min( 2*(-min_val) + max_val, (-min_val) +2*max_val )\n\nWait, note that in Java, they are using Math.min. In Fortran, we have to compute those two values and then take the minimum of the two.\n\nThe code:\n\nIf the condition holds, then temp is the minimum of (2*(-min_val)+max_val) and (-min_val + 2*max_val). The other case else temp is maximum( abs(min_val), abs(max_val) ).\n\nThe else refers to the cases where either both min and max are negative, or both non-negative, or only one is zero. \n\nOnce temp is computed, ans is set to the minimum between ans and temp.\n\nThe rest of the code in else if block.\n\nOnce the loop is done, print ans.\n\nThe else part (when N ==K and K !=1):\n\nIn that case, the code takes min_val as S(1) (since i=0 would be first element of Java's zero-based, but in Fortran, the first element S(1)), the max_val as S(N) (since for N-K when N= K, it's N-K=0, but in else clause, which is for N-K=0, when K equals N, so then the window is entire array. So the min is S(1) and max is S(K), but since N=K, S(K)=S(N). \n\nThen the same computation for min and max as before. \n\nSo in Fortran, when the else is triggered (N-K==0 and K>1):\n\nmin_val = S(1)\n\nmax_val = S(N)\n\nThen condition as before and print the appropriate calculation.\n\nNow let me structure the program step by step.\n\nVariables:\n\n- N, K integers\n\n- S array of length N, integers\n\n- temp, ans, but temp can be a temporary. Since in each loop iteration, temp is computed fresh each time.\n\nSo in Fortran code, variables:\n\ninteger::N, K, i, ans, temp, min_val, max_val\n\nWait but maybe min_val and max_val can be temporary variables inside each loop step.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you have to declare all variables before statements. So need to declare variables first.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nStart with the program:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC107_C\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, K, i, j, temp, ans, min_val, max_val\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: S\n    real(kind=8) :: a_val, b_val ! Not needed? Wait the variables in the Java code are integers, so probably all operations are integer. So the temporary calculations for min_val and max_val will be integers.\n\nWait 2*(-min_val) + max_val must be integer. So yes.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst, read N and K:\n\nread(*,*) N, K\n\nAllocate S:\n\nallocate( S(N) )\n\nThen read the array:\n\nread(*,*) (S(i), i=1,N)\n\nThen:\n\nInitialization of ans = 1e9 (but in integer). So, in Fortran, 1e9 is 1000000000. \n\nans = 1000000000\n\nNow, proceed with the conditions.\n\nFirst, K ==1?\n\nif (K == 1) then\n\n    do i=1,N\n        temp = S(i)\n        ! here, the absolute value is ABS(temp)\n        ans = min( ans, ABS(temp) )\n    end do\n    print *, ans\n\nelse if ( (N - K) /= 0 ) then  ! i.e., when K is not 1, and N-K is not zero, meaning N > K\n\n    do i=1, N-K+1   ! since N - K+1 steps correspond to i from 1 to N-K+1?\n\n        min_val = S(i) \n        max_val = S( i + K -1 )\n\n        if ( min_val < 0 .and. max_val >0 ) then\n            temp = minval( 2*(-min_val)+max_val, (-min_val) + 2*max_val )\n        else\n            temp = max( ABS(min_val), ABS(max_val) )\n        end if\n\n        ans = min( ans, temp )\n\n    end do\n\n    print *, ans\n\nelse ! else case is when N == K (since N-K ==0) and K /=1\n\n    min_val = S(1) \n    max_val = S(N)  ! since entire array is taken as the window\n\n    if ( min_val < 0 .and. max_val >0 ) then\n        temp = min( 2*(-min_val) +max_val, (-min_val)+ 2*max_val )\n    else\n        temp = max( ABS(min_val), ABS(max_val) )\n    end if\n\n    print *, temp\n\nend if\n\nend program atcoder_ABC107_C\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the min between two integers is done with the MIN function. So in the if case when ... then compute both values and then take the minimum.\n\nWait in the first case inside the if statement of the loop:\n\ntemp = min( (2*(-min_val) + max_val), ( (-min_val)+2*max_val) )\n\nWait but in Fortran, the MIN function takes two integers here.\n\nYes. So that can be written as temp = min( (2*(-min_val)+max_val), ( -min_val + 2*max_val ) )\n\nWait but parentheses might be important here. So to compute both expressions, and then take their minimum.\n\nWait in the code the expressions are:\n\nFirst term: 2*(-min_val) + max_val\n\nSecond term: (-min_val) + 2*max_val \n\nYes.\n\nSo in that case:\n\ntemp = min( 2*(-min_val) + max_val ,  (-min_val) + 2*max_val )\n\nWait need to make sure the terms are calculated before passed to MIN.\n\nSo that part is okay.\n\nWait in Fortran, the MIN function can be intrinsic. So Fortran's MIN is okay for that.\n\nTesting a possible mistake: For example, in the loop when initializing variables:\n\nInside the else if loop (for N-K !=0):\n\nInside the loop, min_val and max_val are computed for each i. Need to recompute each time, so variables declared outside the loop? Since those are temporary, variables min_val and max_val are declared as separate variables before the loop?\n\nWait in the code as written in the Fortran code above:\n\nThe variables min_val and max_val are declared in the main variable declarations. So they can be overwritten in loops.\n\nYes. That's okay.\n\nNow let me check for the other part when N ==K. The else clause.\n\nIn that case, after computing min and max, the temp is computed, then printed.\n\nWait, the variable 'ans' is initialized but not used in this case. Because in that else clause, after else, there is no loop, so the temp is directly computed and printed, not using ans. But in the elif and first branches, ans is initialized to 1e9 and then updated. But here, directly assigning temp to the variable that will be output.\n\nWait but in Java code's else clause (when N = K and K is not 1), they compute temp as either the min between the two terms, or the max of the absolute values. Then print that value directly, no looping, no ans variable. \n\nWait in the code I wrote above in else clause (else branch):\n\nCompute temp and then print temp, which is correct. The variable 'ans' is not used here. Which is okay, because the ans variable was only used in the loops where we needed to track the minimum over all iterations. \n\nSo the Fortran code should be okay here.\n\nNow, what about the first part: in K=1 case.\n\nLoop over all elements, temp is set to each S(i). Then ans is updated to the minimum between ans and the absolute value. Then after the loop, print ans, which works.\n\nNow, in the else if clause, after the loop, print(ans). Also correct.\n\nIn the else block, compute temp and directly print that.\n\nNow, check variable declarations. The variables S must be allocated. \n\nWait in Fortran, allocation and variables.\n\nAlso, the code after the first test case (K=1) uses the ans variable which is initialized to 1e9.\n\nAnother thing: in Java, in the K !=1 case:\n\n    for (int i = 0; i <= N - K; i++)\n\nthe next element is S[i+K-1]. So for i from 0 to N-K, for Java's 0-based array. In the Fortran code, in the loop, (i) ranges from 1 to (N \u2212 K +1). That way, the indices are correct. For example, when i reaches N-K+1:\n\ni + K -1 = (N-K+1)+(K-1) = N - K +1 + K-1 = N. So the max index is N, which is okay because in fortran the array is size N, up to N.\n\nOther checks:\n\nWhat about when N = K and K !=1?\n\nYes, then min_val is first element, max_val is S(N), which corresponds to Java's when N=K, the window is from start to end. Correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is types. Since the problem says S[i] can be up to probably 1e9, but since all computations are done on integers, if the intermediate values can overflow?\n\nBut in Fortran, integers by default are 4 bytes (4 bytes for 32-bit, but perhaps in newer Fortran it's 4 or 8?), which can hold up to 2^31-1 which is ~2e9, so even with N=1e5, but in this problem, the K is such that K up to... hmm, but perhaps in the problem constraints, the values are within 32-bit. The code is written in Java with integers. So the Fortran code should be using integers of appropriate size, but assuming they are standard integers.\n\nNow, the 'ans' variable in the else if-clause loop:\n\nInitially, ans is 1e9, then each temp is computed, and ans is updated to min(ans, temp). So that's correct.\n\nFinal step, in Fortran, the output formatting:\n\nIn Java, they print the answer with System.out.println(...), which just prints the number followed by a new line. So in Fortran, using print *, ans would do.\n\nNow testing a possible error in Fortran's 0-based vs 1-based arrays, but the translations handle that correctly as per steps above.\n\nNow code:\n\nThe variables need to be properly declared. Let me write the full code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC107_C\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, K, i, ans, temp, min_val, max_val\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: S\n\n    ! Read N and K\n    read(*,*) N, K\n\n    ! Allocate the array\n    allocate(S(N))\n\n    ! Read the S array elements\n    read(*,*) (S(i), i =1,N)\n\n    ans = 1000000000\n\n    if (K ==1) then\n        do i = 1, N\n            temp = S(i)\n            ans = min(ans, abs(temp))\n        end do\n        print *, ans\n    else if ((N - K) /=0) then\n        do i=1, N-K+1\n            min_val = S(i)\n            max_val = S(i + K -1)\n            if (min_val <0 .and. max_val >0) then\n                temp = min( 2*(-min_val) + max_val, (-min_val) + 2*max_val )\n            else\n                temp = max( abs(min_val), abs(max_val) )\n            end if\n\n            ans = min(ans, temp)\n        end do\n        print *, ans\n    else\n        min_val = S(1)\n        max_val = S(N)\n        if (min_val <0 .and. max_val >0 ) then\n            temp = min( 2*(-min_val) + max_val, (-min_val) + 2*max_val )\n        else\n            temp = max( abs(min_val), abs(max_val) )\n        end if\n        print *, temp\n    end if\n\n    ! Deallocate array?\n    deallocate(S)\nend program atcoder_ABC107_C\n\nWait the deallocate(S) is optional, but good practice. The code has it.\n\nAnother possible oversight: when K=1, after the loop ans is printed. Else if clause also after loop ans. Else case directly prints temp, which is okay since there's no loop variable for that case. The 'ans' variable is initialized but not used there, which is fine.\n\nWait the variables min_val and max_val are used inside all the condition. They should be declared in the right place.\n\nYes, all variables including min_val, max_val, temp are in the declared variables in the program.\n\nPotential mistakes:\n\nWait in the fortran code's else if case, the loop is for i from 1 to N-K+1. Let's test with N=5 and K=2:\n\nN - K +1 =5-2+1=4, so i=1,2,3,4.\n\nEach i's window has K elements: from i to i+K-1 (i+1). That is, for i=4: K elements would be 4 and 5, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible check: when N=2, K=2 (N-K is zero). Else clause: then the else part will execute. So min_val S(1), max S(2), and proceed correctly.\n\nAnother thing: when N-K is 0, but N-K could also mean N-K is 0 when K=N, so yes.\n\nNow I think that's correct."
