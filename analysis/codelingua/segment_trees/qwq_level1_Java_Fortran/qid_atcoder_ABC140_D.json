    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the code is doing. \n\nThe Java program seems to handle some string processing. Let's parse through it step by step.\n\nLooking at the code, there's a main method which reads two integers N and K, then a string S. The string is converted to character arrays c1 and c3. Then there are loops modifying these arrays based on certain conditions involving flags and counts. Then after processing the arrays, there are parts where the sums (sum1 and sum3) are being computed based on consecutive characters. The max of the two sums is printed.\n\nFirst, translating input. In Fortran, input can be read using, say, read(*,*) for integers, and for the string we can read a character array. Since strings in Fortran are fixed length, but the input here is probably a single line, but in the Java code, sc.next() is used which reads the next token. However, since the problem is related to a problem from AtCoder, maybe the input is N K followed by the string S. So the input order would be: first N, K, then S as a single string. So in Fortran, first read N and K:\n\ninteger, parameter :: n=... but wait, perhaps better to read them as variables.\n\nWait, variables in Fortran are declared in the beginning. So perhaps:\n\nprogram atcoder\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, k\n  character(len=...) :: s\n  read(*,*) n, k\n  read(*, '(A)') s\n\nWait, but in Java the string S is given via sc.next(). Wait, in the problem ABC140 D, probably the string S is read as a single word. So the inputs would be: first line is N K, then the second line is the string.\n\nHmm, perhaps the input has two lines, but the code uses sc.next() which reads first N, then K, then the string. Because sc is like scanning tokens. Wait, in Java code:\n\nThey do:\n\nint N = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());\nint K = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());\nString S = sc.next();\n\nSo the next() is the next token. So the inputs would be, for example, something like:\n\n5 1\nRLRLR\n\nThen sc.next() first reads '5', then next() gives '1', then next() gives 'RLRLR'.\n\nSo in the input, the string S is provided as a single token. So even if it's given on one line with everything, the third sc.next() would pick the string correctly. So in Fortran, perhaps we'll need to read after the N and K, then read the string in a line. But in Fortran, the way to do that would be to read everything until end of line. Let's see, in that case:\n\nPerhaps the code can be structured as:\n\nRead N and K from first line, then read the next line's entire content as a string S. But how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, can read the entire first line (including N,K and possible the string if they are on the same line?) but that might complicate. Probably better to split into two reads.\n\nFirst line: Read N, K. But in Fortran, if the first line is like \"5 1\", then:\n\nread(*,*) n, k\n\nSo that works. Second line: the string S.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s  ! Assuming N is at most like 1e3, given AtCoder's problem constraints (since ABC140 D probably N is up to 1e5? Wait, but in Fortran array subscripts are 1-based. Wait, may need to declare the maximum length, etc., which complicates things a bit. Well, perhaps proceeding step by step.\n\nAlso, arrays in Fortran are 1-based. The loops in Java start from i=0. So we have to adjust indices accordingly.\n\nLooking back at the code:\n\nThe Java code starts with N as the number of characters in S, so the length of S is N.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to read the string S with length exactly N. Hmmm. Since Fortran strings can be explicitly sized variables. Let's see, perhaps:\n\nRead N, K from first line.\n\nThen read the second line into S, which must be exactly N characters. So, after determining N, we can declare S as character(len=N). But variables used in parameter statements have to be compile-time constants. Therefore, that's not allowed here. So dynamic array. Well, perhaps declaring a sufficiently large array and then using only the N characters. Alternatively, in Fortran 2003, maybe variables can be used in array declarations with ALLOCATE. But to keep it simple, maybe use a fixed size. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s  ! assuming N can be up to 1e5 perhaps\n\nAlternatively, for the problem's constraints, but since I don't know the constraints, but this translate with the existing parameters. Well, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, variable declarations.\n\nThen the code creates two character arrays c1 and c3 from S. In Java, the .toCharArray() makes a new array yes? So, in Fortran, since S is a string, it can be converted to an array of characters. But in Fortran, to make c1 and c3, perhaps we can have two arrays c1 and c3 of length N.\n\nIn the main code:\n\nFirst part:\n\nProcessing the first case, modifying c1:\n\nFor the first loop over i from 0 to N-1 (since in for(int i=0; i < N; i++)) in Java's arrays (0-based). The Fortran array will be 1-based, so need to adjust index i from 1 to N.\n\nWait, in the loop code:\n\nThey have variables flag and count initialized. The code processes each character and applies modifications based on whether it's a L or R.\n\nLet me see the Java code's first loop:\n\nThe first loop for c1:\n\nInitialize flag=false, count=0\n\nLoop from i=0 (Java) to N-1:\n\nif flag is true and c1[i] is 'R', then set flag to false and increment count. Break if count matches K.\n\nThen, if the current character (a[i] is 'L'), then set flag to true, change c1's character to 'R', and continue.\n\nWait, the code:\n\n            if (flag && c1[i] == 'R') {\n                flag = false;\n                count++;\n            }\n            if (count == K) {\n                break;\n            }\n            if (c1[i] == 'L') {\n                flag = true;\n                c1[i] = 'R';\n            }\n\nSo the order matters here. The flag check comes first, then the count check, then the check for c1[i] being L.\n\nThe logic is:\n\nFor each character in the array c1 (which starts as S.toCharArray):\n\nWe are to look for sequences where we have an L followed by something, but perhaps the flags track when a L is found, then if next R is encountered (after), then we count? Not sure exactly, but the code is processing the string to replace K L's with R, starting from the left? Or does it overwrite L to R when certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this part is trying to flip some L's to R's in a way that each such flip can give a count. Not sure, but the code's logic must be preserved in translation.\n\nSo in the first part of the code for c1:\n\nThe code is performing operations on each character, tracking a flag when an L is found, and when a following R is encountered (while the flag is true), then it counts an occurrence and resets the flag. After finding K such occurrences, it stops and breaks out of the loop early. \n\nAlso, in the 3rd part, for c3, a similar loop but flipped (R vs L?).\n\nIn any case, the Fortran code would need to replicate the same steps. The key is to translate the loops and conditions correctly, adjusting for 1-based vs 0-based indices.\n\nFirst, let's restructure the variables needed in Fortran:\n\nWe have variables:\n\ninteger :: N, K, count, i\nlogical :: flag\ncharacter(len=1000), dimension(N) :: c1, c3\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s ! possibly size N, but let's use a sufficiently long array.\n\nWait, the S is input as a string. Then, the arrays need to be either equivalent to the S's characters. Alternatively, in Fortran, s is an array of characters. Since in Fortran, a single-character strings can be accessed by s(1:1), s(2:2), etc.\n\nWait, alternatively, when declaring:\n\nAssume that s is a character string of length N, so s is of length N. Then each character can be referred by s( i ) where i is from 1 to N. But to copy this into c1 and c3 arrays:\n\nWait, but in Fortran, if s is a string, then s can be referenced as an array:\n\ncharacter(len=N) :: s\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(N) :: cr! perhaps better to have arrays of characters. Wait, maybe a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, to make it easier, perhaps use variables c1 and c3 as arrays of characters, where c1 is initialized as the characters of S.\n\nWait, in Java c1 is a char array initialized from S's toCharArray, so in Fortran:\n\nAfter initializing, perhaps:\n\nc1 = [( s(i:i), i = 1, N )]\n\nSimilarly for c3.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nc1(1:N) = s(1:N)\n\nYes, because in Fortran, if c1 and s are both arrays of length N, then c1 = s(1:N) would work.\n\nAlternatively, yes, in Fortran strings can be assigned directly as well, but for arrays, perhaps we need to loop or use array assignments.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nprogram atcoder\n  integer :: n, k, i\n  character(len=100000) :: s = ' '  ! Probably N is up to 1e5, so declaring len=1e5?\n  character(len=1) :: c1(100000), c3(100000)\n\nBut that's getting ahead. Let me proceed:\n\nFirst, declarations.\n\nThe code requires S to be read, so in Fortran code:\n\nRead first line: N and K.\n\nThen read next line: S (the string) \n\nSo:\n\nprogram atcoder_ab140_d\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, k, i, j\n  logical :: flag\n  integer :: sum1, sum2, count_internal, current_count\n  character(len=1) :: temp_char\n  ! Declare arrays for characters. Let\u2019s assume maximum possible size for the problem\n\n  ! assuming N up to 1e5 (But the original problem may have different. But since this is a code translation assuming the input is within reason)\n\n  integer, parameter :: max_n = 100000\n  character(len=1), dimension (max_n) :: c1, c3, s_char\n  ! We can read the string S into a character array:\n  character(len=max_n) :: s\n\n  ! Read input:\n  read(*,*) n, k\n  read(*, '(A)') s\n  ! Now assign each character in s to s_char array:\n  do i = 1, n\n     s_char(i) = s(i:i)\n  end do\n  \n  \n  ! Then copy to c1 and c3 arrays\n\n  ! Initialize c1 and c3 as copies of s_char:\n  c1 = s_char\n  c3 = s_char  \n\n  ! Now, process first loop for c1\n\n  flag = .false.\n  count = 0\n\n  do i = 1, n\n     if ( flag ) then\n        if ( c1(i) == 'R') then\n           flag = .false.\n           count = count +1\n           if ( count == k ) exit   ! break the loop\n        end if\n     end if\n     if (count == k ) exit\n     if ( c1(i) ==  'L' ) then\n        flag = .true.\n        c1(i) = 'R'   ! change L to R\n     end if\n  end do\n\nWait, but let me see the code again. In Java, the first loop's inner steps are:\n\nFirst, check if flag is true and c1[i] is 'R', then set flag to false, count up. \n\nThen check if count has reached K, and break (so the next lines would have an exit if so here).\n\nThen, check if current character is L. If yes, turn it into R and set flag to true.\n\nSo the condition order may matter.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the order is: first, check if (flag && c[i] is R). Then, if that is true, they set flag to false and increment count. Then immediately, after the (if flag...) block, the next check is if count is K, break, so the code says:\n\n    if (flag && c1[i] == 'R') {\n        flag = false;\n        count++;\n    }\n    if (count == K)\n        break;\n    if (c1[i] == 'L') {\n        flag = true;\n        c1[i] = 'R';\n    }\n\nThus in Fortran, the code must be structured similarly. The count is checked after the first block and before the second check.\n\nSo the code in Fortran must be:\n\n    do i=1 to N:\n\n       % check the flag and R\n       if ( flag and (c1(i) == 'R') ) then\n           flag = .false.\n           count = count +1\n       end if\n\n       % Check if count == K: if so, break loop\n       if (count == K) then\n          exit\n       end if\n       \n       % Then check what character\n       if (c1(i) == 'L') then\n          flag =.true.\n          c1(i) = 'R'\n       end if\n\n    end do\n\nYes, this order is important so that changing the c1(i) to 'R' doesn't interfere with the previous check (because after the initial check).\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the sequence must be:\n\nProcess the flag and R check first. Also after that, check count. Then do the L check and modify.\n\nThus, that loop should be written as above.\n\nProceeding with translation.\n\nNow after the first loop for c1, the code performs another similar loop for c3, but with L and R swapped.\n\nThe second loop in Java code (for c3):\n\n            flag = false;\n            count = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                if (flag && c3[i] == 'L') {\n                    flag = false;\n                    count++;\n                }\n                if (count == K) {\n                    break;\n                }\n                if (c3[i] == 'R') {\n                    flag = true;\n                    c3[i] = 'L';\n                }\n            }\n\nIn Fortran, this is similar but L and R are swapped. The flag is triggered when finding R, then when followed by an L?\n\nWait, the logic here is:\n\nThe loop starts with flag false, count 0.\n\nFor each i from 1 to N (in Fortran):\n\nFirst, check if flag is true and current is 'L', then set flag to false, count up. Then check count. \n\nIf the current character is R, then set it to L ('R' becomes 'L'), set flag to true.\n\nSo:\n\n    flag = .false.\n    count =0\n    do i =1, n\n       if ( flag ) then\n          if ( c3(i) == 'L') then\n             flag = .false.\n             count = count +1\n             if ( count == K ) then\n                exit\n             end if\n          end if\n       end if\n       if ( count == K ) exit\n       if ( c3(i) == 'R' ) then\n          flag = .true.\n          c3(i) = 'L'\n       end if\n    end do\n\nWait, the Java code in that loop is:\n\n            if (flag && c3[i] == 'L') { // set flag, increment if \n\n                flag = false;\n                count++;\n            }\n            if (count == K) {\n                break;\n            }\n            if (c3[i] == 'R') {\n                flag = true;\n                c3[i] = 'L';\n            }\n\nSo the Java code after checking the flag and L, then checks count and breaks, then does the R to L conversion and flag.\n\nThus, rearranged:\n\n- After checking for 'L' (with flag), then check if count reaches K (so exit loop). \n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\nSo after the first block (flag and L check), increment count, then move to check whether count is K. That need to exit.\n\nThus, code outline in Fortran:\n\nloop:\n\nif (flag and current == L then ... \n\nthen after that, check if count equals K. exit.\n\nthen check current R.\n\nThus:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n   if ( flag ) then\n      if ( c3(i) == 'L' ) then\n         flag = .false.\n         count = count +1\n         if ( count == K ) exit\n      end if\n   end if\n\n   if ( count == K ) then\n      exit\n   end if\n\n   if ( c3(i) == 'R' ) then \n      flag = .true.\n      c3(i) = 'L'\n   end if\nend do\n\nYes, that seems right. So this part is handled.\n\nAfter modifying the arrays c1 and c3, the sum part comes.\n\nNext steps: calculating sum1 and sum3 by counting the consecutive duplicates.\n\nThe Java code for sum1 loops over S1 (which is c1 as String), and counts how many adjacent duplicates exist. For example, a run of three 'R's would contribute 2 (since two adjacent pairs).\n\nThe code for sum1 is as follows:\n\n        count =1\n        sum1 =0\n        bef = S1.charAt(0);\n        for (i=1; i < N; i++) {\n            if (S1.charAt(i) == bef) {\n                count++;\n            } else {\n                sum1 += count -1;\n                bef = S1.charAt(i);\n                count =1;\n            }\n            // then, after incrementing count: \n            // if at last character, append the count-1\n        }\n        // after the loop ends, check if we need to add the last count-1 ?\n\nWait in the original Java code:\n\nThe loop:\n\nThe code for sum1 is:\n\n        count =1\n        sum1 =0\n        bef = S1[0];\n        for (int i =1; i<N; i++) {\n            if (S1[i] == bef) {\n                count++;\n                if (i == N-1) {\n                    sum1 += count-1;\n                }\n            } else {\n                sum1 += count -1;\n                bef = S1[i];\n                count =1;\n            }\n        }\n\nSo the logic here is that whenever the next character is the same as before, count goes up, but when it's different, sum += count -1 (the length of the previous run minus 1?), and reset count and bef.\n\nAt the end of the loop, if the last characters were part of a run, they would have been accounted for only if it was triggered by an end? Because in the case where the character is same, the final check (i==N-1) would trigger adding.\n\nBut perhaps this can be restructured to account for the last run after the loop.\n\nAlternatively, in the code example, when moving to the next character:\n\nWhen the character is same as previous (same), count increases, and at the end of the iteration, after the loop, there might still be a remaining count to add. So in that case, after the loop, sum1 should add (count-1).\n\nThus the more standard approach would:\n\nInitialize bef as first char, current_count=1\n\nLoop through 1 to N-1 (if starting at pos1 in arrays). For each step:\n\nIf same as bef, inc current_count. Else, add (current_count-1) to total, reset current_count to 1 and bef. \n\nAfter all iterations, add the last run's count-1.\n\nThus, the Java code is trying to do that, but interleaved with possible premature completion.\n\nThe original code\u2019s logic may have a problem in that the 'if (i == N-1)' is only triggered in the case when it was a same character, so in the case of the run, when on the last character, it proceeds to increment the count, then checks if it's the last character and adds count -1? So perhaps the code is handling the end case there.\n\nHmm, but maybe an error in assuming that if in same case but not at last step, but in any case, perhaps translating as per the code\u2019s exact steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps best to restructure the code for sum1 as:\n\nInitialize sum to 0. \nprev = first character. count =1\nLoop from 2nd character (since 0-based in Java):\n\nWait the Java code:\n\ni starts from 1 (since in Java, the loop starts at 0 to N-1, so i from 0, and bef = Char(0). Then for i=1 to N-1.\n\nSo the Fortran code's arrays (s1) are 1-based, so for the arrays c1 (size N), we can start from 1:\n\nsum1 =0\n\nbef = c1(1)\n\ncount =1\n\n! Then loop from i=2 to N \n\ndo i=2, N\n\n   if (c1(i) == bef) then \n      count = count +1\n      ! check if it's the last element. Well, but perhaps at the end, handle.\n\n   else \n      sum1 = sum1 + (count -1) \n      bef = c1(i)\n      count = 1\n   end if\nend do\n\n! After loop, add count -1 for the last segment\nsum1 = sum1 + (count -1)\n\nWhich is better and avoids the N-1 check in the body.\n\nThus, in Fortran code, it's better to do this. Because the original Java code's method may have off-by-1 issues, perhaps.\n\nSo proceed to code sum1 and sum3 this way.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nsum1 and sum3 initialization: \n\n! for c1:\nsum1 =0\n\ncurrent_char = c1(1)\n\ncurrent_count =1\n\nthen loop over i=2, N:\n\ndo i=2 to N\n\n   if (c1(i) == current_char) then\n\n      current_count = current_count +1\n\n   else \n\n      sum1 = sum1 + current_count -1\n\n      current_char = c1(i)\n\n      current_count =1 \n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! after loop, add current_count contributions\n\nsum1 = sum1 + (current_count -1)\n\nSame for sum3.\n\nThus the code for sum1 and sum3 can be rewritten in this manner.\n\nThus, in the current code:\n\nThe Java code has:\n\nsum1 is computed as:\n\nThe bef and count start with the first character.\n\nThen loop from i=1 to N-1 (Java is 0-based thus for i from 1 (Java index)  corresponds to Fortran's 2nd character? Wait):\n\nWait in Java:\n\nchar[] c1: the first character is at index 0. \n\nThe code is:\n\n before the loop:\n\nbef = S1[0], the first character.\n\nthen for each i from 1 (Java) to N-1 (0-based) which is i=(1..N-1) in Java (1-based in characters up to N), \n\nthus in Fortran:\n\nThe first step is to set bef as c1(1), and count=1.\n\n The loop will run from 2 to N.\n\nThus, using this method is better.\n\nSo in Fortran code for sum1:\n\nsum1 =0\n\n   if (N ==0) then ... but assuming N >=1\n\n   bef = c1(1)\n\n   count =1\n\n   do i=2, N\n\n      if ( c1(i) == bef ) then \n\n         count=count+1\n\n      else \n\n         sum1 = sum1 + count -1 \n\n         bef = c1(i)\n\n         count =1\n\n      end if \n\n   end do \n\n   ! add the final count's value \n\n   sum1 = sum1 + count -1 \n\n   Similarly for sum3:\n\n   Similarly, initialize bef = c3(1), count =1, etc. \n\nThus, that would be better than replicating the Java's possibly convoluted code.\n\nIn the original code, perhaps the same logic.\n\nNow putting it all together.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\nRead in N, K, S.\n\nConvert S to array s_char for processing.\n\nMake copies of s_char into c1 and c3. (since in fortran, arrays are passed by reference, but when using assignment operator, they are copied)\n\nWait Fortran is pass by reference usually, but assignment of arrays copies the values. \n\nc1 = s_char(1:n), or better, \n\ninitialization:\n\nc1 = s_char; \n\nc3 = s_char.\n\nThen process the loops for c1 and c3.\n\nThen calculate sum1 and sum3.\n\nFinally, output the sum of both maximum.\n\nNow, writing the full Fortran code.\n\nBut first, variable declarations:\n\nWe can proceed as follows:\n\nprogram atcoder_ab140d\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, k, i\n  logical :: flag\n  integer :: sum1, sum3, current_count_c1, current_count_c3\n  character(len=1) :: bef1, bef3\n\n  ! Arrays:\n\n  integer, parameter :: max_n = 100000  ! Maximum possible N\n  character(len=1), dimension(max_n) :: s_char, c1, c3\n\n  ! Read input:\n  read(*,*) n, k\n  read(*, \"(A)\") s_char(1:n) \n\n  ! Wait no: How to read a string longer than max_n?\n\nWait, no. Because the read statement for the string:\n\nWe need to read the string into a character variable, then take its characters. So better to do:\n\nRead the string into a single variable s:\n\n  character(len=max_n) :: s\n  read(*,*) n, k\n  read(*,'(A)') s\n\n  ! Then populate s_char from s:\n  do i =1, n\n    ! assuming that the s string is exactly n characters long.\n    s_char(i) = s(i:i)\n  end do\n\nWait, but Fortran strings can have trailing spaces, so need to make sure that s is exactly of length N. Because if the input has a new-line after N K, and the next line is exactly the N characters, then the second read is okay. \n\nAssuming that the string input is read correctly, this is manageable.\n\nOnce the arrays are initialized, proceed with processing.\n\nStep 1: process c1:\n\nc1 is initialized as a copy of s_char:\n\nc1 = s_char(1:n)\n\nWait arrays are initialized at declaration, but to copy:\n\nInitialize c1 and c3:\n\nc1 =s_char\n\nc3=s_char\n\nbut in fortran, array assignments are possible.\n\n yes, in Fortran:\n\nc1 = s_char(1:N)\n\nSimilarly for c3.\n\nWait need to ensure that arrays have same length. With the array parameters.\n\nAfter that, process first loop for c1:\n\nflag is initialized false, count=0 (integer, say \"count1\").\n\nThe loop:\n\ninteger :: count1, count2\n\nprocess_c1:\n\nflag_c1_l = .false.\n\ncount1 =0 \n\ndo i =1, n\n   if ( flag_c1_l ) then\n    ! Wait, in loop for the first case:\n\nWait, in the first loop's condition, checking for c1(i) and R when flag is true.\n\nWait Let me re-read the first loop's code again.\n\nFirst loop for c1:\n\nflag starts as .false., count is 0.\n\n for i from 1 to N:\n\n        if (flag && c1[i] == 'R') { \n\n                flag = false;\n\n                count++;\n\n            }\n\n            if (count == K) {\n\n                break;\n\n             }\n\n            if (c1[i] == 'L') {\n\n                flag = true;\n\n                c1[i] = 'R';\n\n            }\n\nSo in terms of Fortran:\n\nflag is the flag variable, no need for suffix.\n\nreset:\n\nflag = .false.\n\ncount =0 \n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   ! first check if (flag and c1(i)=='R') \n\n   if ( flag ) then \n\n       if ( c1(i) == 'R' ) then \n\n          flag = .false.\n\n          count = count + 1 \n\n          if ( count ==k ) then \n\n             exit \n\n          end if \n\n       end if \n\n   end if \n\n   ! check count: if count ==k, exit \n\n   if ( count ==k ) then \n\n      exit \n\n   end if \n\n   ! Then check current char \n\n   if ( c1(i) == 'L' ) then \n\n      flag = .true. \n\n      c1(i) = 'R' \n\n   end if \n\n end do \n\nYes, that would replicate the logic. For that:\n\nYes, the 'flag' variable here is the same.\n\nNow after processing the first array, the code for the second loop (processing c3):\n\nThe code for c3 is the L/R swap:\n\n flag = .false.\n\n count =0 \n\n do i =1, n\n\n   if ( flag ) then \n\n      if ( c3(i) == 'L' ) then \n\n         flag = .false.\n\n         count = count +1 \n\n         if ( count == K ) exit \n\n      end if \n\n   end if \n\n   if ( count == K ) exit \n\n   if ( c3(i) == 'R' ) then \n\n      flag = .true. \n\n      c3(i) = 'L'\n\n    end if \n\n end do \n\nYes.\n\nSo after processing both arrays:\n\nThen calculate sum1 and sum3.\n\nsum1's calculation:\n\nsum1 =0\n\ncurrent_count =1 \n\nbef = c1(1)\n\ndo i=2, n \n\n  if (c1(i) == bef) then \n\n     current_count = current_count +1 \n\n  else \n\n     sum1 = sum1 + (current_count -1 )\n\n     bef = c1(i)\n\n     current_count =1 \n\n  end if \n\nend do \n\nsum1 = sum1 + (current_count -1 )\n\nSame for sum3.\n\nThus variables for that:\n\n! sum1:\n\ninteger :: current_count_c1, current_count_c3\ncharacter(len=1) :: bef_c1, bef_c3 \n\nso in code:\n\ncurrent_count_c1=1\n\nbef_c1 = c1(1)\n\nsum1=0 \n\nloop:\n\ndo i=2, n \n\n... \n\nThen same for sum3:\n\ncurrent_count_c3 =1 \n\nbef_c3 =c3(1) \n\nsum3 =0 \n\nloop over i=2 to N: \n\n...\n\nThus, putting all together:\n\nThe code structure in Fortran is:\n\nAfter the array preparations.\n\nProcess the loops for c1 and c3.\n\nThen compute sums as above.\n\nFinally, output the maximum between sum1 and sum3.\n\nThus, writing the full code step by step:\n\nNow, code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ab140d\n \nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k, i, count1, count2, sum1, sum3\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s_char, c1, c3\nlogical :: flag\n\n! declare max size.

Wait in second processing (c3), the variable is called 'count' in the code, but in the Fortran code in the processing:\n\nsecond loop (c3):\n\nWe can use count2, but we need to initialize count2=0.\n\nYes, in the code above: code says\n\ncount2 was used, but declared as a variable (declared under variables: 'integer :: n, k, i, count1, count2, sum1, sum3, ... etc.')\n\nYes, in the variables 'count2' exists.\n\nSo loops are okay.\n\nIn the first loop for c1:\n\nWe use count1.\n\nThe code during processing for c1 uses count1 == K check, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly for count2 while processing c3.\n\nThe 'exit' in loops exits the loop, thus working like break in Java.\n\nNow check sum calculation.\n\nYes, the sum loops.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nTest N=1.\n\nSuppose N=1, K=0.\n\nThen for c1:\n\nLoop for 1 iteration. \n\nInitially flag.F., count1=0.\n\nIf c1 is whatever, but since there's no L or R to change, but K=0, the loop exits?\n\nWait K=0 is a possible parameter. Let's see if K can be zero. The problem's constraints might ensure K is between 1 and N. But the code can handle it.\n\nBut the code should correctly process.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nFor N=5, K=1, string 'RLRLR'\n\nOriginal Java code may do something specific. But in any case, the translation seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nInitialization:\n\nIn the code, the s_char array is initialized for i=1 to N, but s could have more than N characters but in s(i:i) for beyond N may have spaces or other issues? The second read with ' (A) ' reads the entire line into s up to max_n length. So s(i:i) for i > len_trim(s) may be spaces or null. \n\nThus, it's important that the input string has exactly N characters. Since this is following the problem's input, so that the second line is exactly N characters. Thus, the code assumes that.\n\nAlso, in the code, when N is 0, but in Java, N is read with sc.next(). So the problem constraints probably have N >=1, so perhaps the edge case where N is 1 and k=0 can be handled. But the code has a check when n==0: no. But that may be unnecessary.\n\nWait in the sum1 code:\n\nif (n ==0) then ... \n\nBut in the problem, N would be at least 1, so this case can be omitted.\n\nBut code includes that. Well, perhaps better to omit unless needed.\n\nThus code is okay.\n\nThe final write statement max(sum1, sum3).\n\nThus the code should work.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nFortran arrays are 1-based, so indices are okay.\n\nTranslating all variables and loops accordingly."
