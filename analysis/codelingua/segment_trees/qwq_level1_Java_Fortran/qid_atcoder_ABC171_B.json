The code uses helper classes for input handling.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let me recall Fortran's features. Fortran is array-oriented, so working with arrays should be straightforward. The main steps are input reading, sorting the array, summing the first K elements, and output. But I need to figure out how to handle input in Fortran the way the Java code does.\n\nThe Java InputReader is a custom class to read efficiently. But in Fortran, I can just read from the standard input using read statements. Maybe there's no need for a separate class. So first, I'll read N and K. Then read N integers into an array, sort the array, sum the first K elements, and print the sum.\n\nLet's start with the main steps.\n\nFirst, variables: n, k, and the array a. Let's assume in Fortran, the array a should be dimensioned with N elements. Since Fortran uses fixed size arrays, but in this case, the size isn't known until runtime, I can use an allocatable array.\n\nThe structure would be something like this:\n\n1. Read N and K from input.\n2. Read N numbers into array a.\n3. Sort the array.\n4. Sum the first K elements.\n5. Print the sum.\n\nNow, how to read the inputs. The first line would be N and K, so something like:\n\nread*, n, k\n\nThen read n numbers:\n\nallocate(a(n))\nread*, a\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are read in a single read statement. But in the Java code, the numbers can be on the same line or spread across multiple lines. Since the Java code's InputReader fetches tokens as they come, the user can input the numbers in any way, even spread across lines. So in Fortran, as long as the numbers are provided consecutively, it should work. The read*, a would read all the elements in the array, so that's probably okay.\n\nNext, sorting the array. In Fortran, there's the intrinsic function ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, but to sort, perhaps a simple method like using the shell sort or bubble sort would be needed? Or is there a built-in sort function? Oh right, in Fortran, there's the `sort` array function in Fortran 2003 and later. But not everyone might have that. Wait, if using Fortran 90 or newer, maybe the standard sort routine isn't available. So perhaps I should implement a simple sort or use the built-in sort intrinsic.\n\nAlternatively, the code can use the `mergesort` or `insertionsort` from an external module? Wait, perhaps the easiest way is to use the `sort` intrinsic, but I need to check if that's available.\n\nAlternatively, let me think. The approach in Java uses Arrays.parallelSort which does a parallel sort. For the purposes of this problem, we can sort the array in Fortran in any way. Since the problem requires the sum of the first K elements after sorting, the order (ascending/descending?) matters. Wait the code in Java sorts with Arrays.parallelSort which sorts in natural order (ascending), so the Fortran code must sort the array in ascending order as well.\n\nAssuming Fortran's sort is available. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in Fortran 2003, the function `sorted_array = sort(array)` is available. Wait, no, perhaps there's a procedure. Alternatively, the Lahey compiler has 'sorted' intrinsic. Hmm, maybe for portable code, it's better to use a built-in function or a subroutine.\n\nWait, actually, in Fortran 90+ you can use the 'shell sort' or bubble sort. Alternatively, perhaps using the `SORT` intrinsic. Wait according to the documentation (assuming Fortran 2008), there is an intrinsic function called `SORT`. So:\n\nsorted_a = sort(a)\n\nBut I need to check.\n\nLet me see. The function `SORT` is in the intrinsic module, so in Fortran:\n\na_sorted = sort(a)\n\nThen the array a_sorted would be sorted in ascending order. So that's easier. Wait, but maybe the default is ascending, but better to confirm the parameters. The `sort` function in Fortran does take an optional argument for a comparison function, but if not provided, it sorts in ascending order for numbers. So that's good.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead N and K.\n\nRead array.\n\nSort array.\n\nSum first K elements.\n\nPrint sum.\n\nSo, code outline in Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k, sum =0\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\nread(*,*) n, k\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread(*,*) a\n\ncall sort(a)\n\ndo i = 1, k\n\nsum = sum + a(i)\n\nend do\n\nwrite(*,*) sum\n\ndeallocate(a)\n\nend program\n\nWait, but Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but in Java it's 0-based. Wait in the Java code, the array is from 0 to n-1, but in Fortran, the first element would be a(1) to a(n). So the code is okay here.\n\nWait, but the sorting in Fortran with the sort function. Let me check that in code.\n\nWait in Fortran, the `sort` intrinsic actually is part of the Fortran 2003 standard. So the code might need to be:\n\nThe sort function returns a sorted array. Wait, perhaps `a = sort(a)`? Let me see. According to my knowledge, you can do:\n\na_sorted = sort(a)\n\nBut to sort the original array, we could do:\n\na = sort(a)\n\nYes. Alternatively, perhaps there is a subroutine called `sort` in some library, but in ISO standard Fortran, the function exists.\n\nThus, the code would work as:\n\nallocate a(n), read a, then a = sort(a). Then loop the first K elements and sum.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loop is from 1 to k, so since the sorted array is in ascending order, adding the first k elements would give the sum of the smallest k elements, which is what the Java code does.\n\nWait yes, in the Java code, the array was sorted with parallelSort (ascending) and the first k elements summed, so that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nWait also, in Fortran, when you read the array with read(*,*), the input can be multiple lines. The same as the Java code's InputReader which reads tokens line by line. So when the user inputs the numbers, they can be on any lines, separated by spaces or newlines, which read * will handle.\n\nPotential issues: if N is zero, but the problem constraints likely ensure that N >=K and k is within valid bounds.\n\nNow, about the code structure.\n\nWait the code above has a possible error: the sort sort function's syntax. Let me see: according to fortran docs, the intrinsic 'sort' is a function that returns a sorted array. So:\n\na_sorted = sort(a)\n\nSo to replace the array:\n\nreal :: a(3) = [3.0,2.0,1.0]\n\na = sort(a) ! now a is [1,2,3]\n\nWait but if the array is integer, it would be same. Thus in this case:\n\nThus in the first code draft:\n\nThe code would be correct except that in Fortran, the implicit typing may be an issue. The variables must be explicitly typed or declared. Since the problem uses integers, the code should have proper declarations.\n\nNow, in program:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc171_b\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k, i, total =0\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\n\nread(*,*) n, k\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)  ! Maybe better to read an entire array in one read?\n\nWait wait, perhaps the code can use read *, a to input the array as a whole, which would work in free format. Let's see.\n\nAssuming the input format is space-separated numbers, then:\n\nread(*,*) a\n\nwill read all the elements. The allocation is done after knowing n.\n\nWait yes. Then, proceeding:\n\na = sort(a)\n\nWait, then sum the first K elements.\n\ntotal = 0\n\ndo i =1, k\n\ntotal = total + a(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen print total.\n\nWait but the sort function in Fortran is part of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module? Or is it declared automatically?\n\nWait perhaps some versions require an explicit import.\n\nWait checking more carefully, the `sort` function is in the intrinsic modules of Fortran 2003 onwards. But I think that standard Fortran 2003 allows the use of the sort function without any explicit import, but some compilers require the declaration. Alternatively, perhaps it's a function in the intrinsic procedures. Let me think again.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I should use the for loop to sort the array. Because if I can't rely on the sort being present, maybe it's better to implement a sort routine.\n\nAlternatively, the user may want to use an explicit sort.\n\nHmm. Let me check. For example, if using the Intel Fortran compiler, the 'Sort' may be available. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest way for a beginner's code is to use a built-in sort function. Let me see: the manual for gfortran (version 4.9) says that the 'sort' function is available in ISO Fortran 2003, and in gfortran since version 4.7. So probably the code can assume that the intrinsic is available.\n\nAssuming that's the case, proceed with the code.\n\nBut in my code, how to sort an integer array:\n\nSuppose 'a' is the array of integers. Then,\n\na = sort(a)\n\nshould work. The function returns a sorted array in ascending order.\n\nLet me also note that in Fortran, arrays are first class, so assigning the sorted array back to a is straightforward.\n\nThus, the code outline is okay.\n\nNow, checking the code again.\n\nThe code:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc171_b\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, k, total=0\n  integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n  read(*,*) n, k\n  allocate( a(n) )\n  read(*,*) a\n  a = sort(a)\n  do i=1,k\n     total = total + a(i)\n  end do\n  print *, total\n  deallocate(a)\nend program\n\nHmm, but in Fortran, there may be a need to have 'i' variable declared. In this code as above, the loop variable i isn't declared. So that's an error.\n\nAh right. So the loop needs to have the i declared as integer. So adding the specification.\n\nSo corrected code:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc171_b\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, k, total=0, i\n  integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n  read(*,*) n, k\n  allocate( a(n) )\n  read(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n  a = sort(a) ! Or just a = sort(a)\n  do i =1, k\n     total = total + a(i)\n  end do\n  print *, total\n  deallocate(a)\nend program atcoder_abc171_b\n\nWait but when reading the array, the read statement in fortran can be as:\n\nread(*,*) a ! Which is sufficient.\n\nYes. Because 'a' is an allocatable array with allocated size n. So the read(*,*) a should read all n elements properly.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc171_b\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, k, total=0, i\n  integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n  read(*,*) n, k\n  allocate( a(n) )\n  read(*,*) a\n  a = sort(a) \n  total = sum( a(1:k) ) ! Alternatively use a loop\n  print *, total\n  deallocate(a)\nend program\n\nWait even better, since Fortran has array sections and intrinsic sum function. So instead of looping, can just sum the first k elements with sum( a(1:k) ) which would be more efficient.\n\nYes! That's better.\n\nTherefore, the code could be written more concisely without the loop.\n\nThus code like:\n\ntotal = sum( a(1:k) )\n\nSo then the code becomes:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc171_b\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, k, total\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n    read*, n, k\n    allocate(a(n))\n    read*, a\n    a = sort(a)\n    total = sum(a(1:k))\n    print*, total\n    deallocate(a)\nend program\n\nAh, even better. Only need to declare the variables properly.\n\nWait variables: total. Need to have type. So total must be declared as integer.\n\nSo that's correct. And 'i' was not needed anymore, as the loop is removed.\n\nThus, the code is shorter.\n\nNow, the main potential issue is whether the sort function is available, and whether it returns in ascending order.\n\nYes, because in Java, the array is sorted in ascending order and the sum is of the first K elements. The sort function in fortran does ascend as default.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the Java code, the sorting is done via parallelSort, which is a stable sort, but here the order for same arrays doesn't matter, just any order is okay.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTesting possible edge case, say N = K, so all elements are summed. Or K=0? Probably problem constraints require K \u2264 N.\n\nAssuming the code is okay.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the Fortran code would look like that.\n\nWait but the 'sort' function might need an explicit specification. Some old compilers might require the module. Let me think. In some versions, like gfortran, the following errormessage could be \"function sort at (1) not elemental or variable but argument 2 is array\". Hmm no, perhaps if it is considered as in the intrinsics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sort function is part of the module intrinsic. Let me check an example.\n\nWait, according to fortran examples, use of the sort function requires that the function is available. So maybe some implementations require inclusion of the `iso_c_binding` or other module? Or no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use the `SORT` intrinsic correctly. Let me look for a sample code: \n\nSuppose:\n\nreal, dimension(3) :: a = (/ 3, 1, 2 /)\na = sort(a)\n\nShould work, and upon execution, a becomes [1,2,3]. That's what I'm hoping.\n\nIn gfortran's documentation, the array transformation functions: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Array-transformation-intrinsic-functions.html#Array-transformation-intrinsic-functions\n\nYes, there's a `SORT` listed there. So in gfortran, this code should work.\n\nHmm. Thus the code should be as follows.\n\nWait, but in the Fortran code, when reading the array, how is multiple lines handled?\n\nThe read(*,*) a is free format, so it will read until enough elements are stored in a. The equivalent to the Java code's scanner which reads all numbers as they come, without individual lines. So for example, inputs separated by new lines between numbers would also be okay.\n\nNow, another possible issue: the `sort` function's return is stored into a, which is okay.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code is as written. So putting it all into the Fortran code box.\n\nWait in the original question, the user wrote:\n\n\"Translate the Java code below to Fortran\".\n\nThe user expects a code that does exactly the same. The code I have here is correct. So I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the array is read via in.ni() for each element, which reads tokens, but in Fortran's read(*,*) it all the elements at once. The difference is that if someone enters numbers in lines, the read(),* a will read all in sequence.\n\nWhich is exactly how the Java code does it. Because the InputReader's ni() gets next token regardless of line.\n\nThus, this is correct.\n\nHence the Fortran code is the one I outlined above."
