    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code is doing. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads input values for N and M. Then it reads N jobs, each with a and b values. The jobs are stored in a priority queue sorted by a and then b. Then, for each day from 1 to M, it takes all jobs with a <= current day, adds their 'b' to another max-heap (as jobQ uses reverse order), and then takes the largest b from that heap to add to the count. \n\nIn Fortran, we need to implement the same logic. But Fortran doesn't have built-in priority queues. Hmm, so I'll need to simulate that or use some existing module. Wait, Fortran has with some priority queue functions, maybe using heapsort? Alternatively, perhaps we can use array-based methods for the queues. Let me think.\n\nWait, the first queue is sorted by a, and then by b. Since in Java, the comparator sorts based on a, then b. The first priority queue (q) is ordered in a sorted way by a then b. \n\nThe next step is, for each day i from 1 to M, we process all jobs in q where a <= i, and add their b to the jobQ (max heap for b). Then take the largest b from jobQ (since poll in reverse order).\n\nSo in Fortran, the main structures needed are the priority queues. Since Fortran doesn't have these natively, maybe we can use heaps to mimic them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can represent the first queue as a list that's kept sorted whenever elements are added. But inserting into an array to maintain sorted order might be tedious. Alternatively, since the first addition is based on a, perhaps when we read all jobs first, we can sort them by a and b, and then process in order as needed.\n\nAh! That's probably a better approach. Because in Java, when you use a priority queue, elements are added and the queue keeps them ordered. So perhaps the jobs can be read first into an array, sorted by a and then b, then as we process each day i, we can add all the jobs where a <=i and not yet processed yet into a max heap (jobQ). \n\nSo the basic idea can be redone in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N and M.\n\n2. Read N jobs, each with a and b, store in an array.\n\n3. Sort the array by a, then by b.\n\n4. Then we process each day from 1 to M. \n\nFor each day i, do:\n\n- Advance through the sorted job list, and collect all jobs with a <= i that haven't been picked yet. Add their b to the jobQ (max heap).\n\n- Then, if any jobs are in the jobQ (which is max-heap), take the largest b and add to cnt.\n\nThe problem then is efficiently managing the jobs that are past a<=i and not yet added to jobQ. Because in Java, the priority queue would handle the order. So perhaps the approach here is to have the jobs sorted once in the beginning and then step through them in order.\n\nSo, here's an outline:\n\nAfter reading and sorting the jobs (sorted by a, then b), we can use an index (current_job_index) to track the next job in the sorted list that might be considered for the next day.\n\nFor each day from 1 to M:\n\n- While the current job's a <= current day:\n\n   - add its b to jobQ (max-heap), then move current_job_index forward.\n\n   - until we reach a job with a > current day.\n\n- Then, if jobQ has elements, take the maximum (b), add to cnt.\n\nThus, this way, we can sequentially process the sorted job list.\n\nNow, the crucial part is implementing the jobQ as a max-heap. Since inserts and extracts need to maintain the max property.\n\nJobQ needs to be a max-heap. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use an array and keep it in a heap structure.\n\nImplementing heap in Fortran:\n\nWe can have an array, where the max element is the parent node. \n\nEach time, when adding a new b, we add to the end of the array and sift up.\n\nWhen removing the maximum (the first element), we swap with last element and sift down.\n\nImplementing that in Fortran is a bit involved, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the built-in sorting functions might not be as efficient, but for smaller constraints?\n\nLooking at the problem constraints (not given here, but from the original problem, like a \u2264 1e9) but for programming languages, Fortran can manage with n log n sort.\n\nWait, but in the algorithm above, the jobs are all pre-sorted. So that can be done with the standard sort. Then in the loop over days, we can walk through the list.\n\nNow, for the jobQ, we need a max-heap. Let's see:\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nPreprocessing:\n\nSort all jobs by increasing a, then increasing b? Wait the comparator in Java has compareTo as (other.a == a) then b is this.b - other.b (so sorts in ascending order). So in the case of same a, smaller b comes first? Wait, no. Wait the code for comparator in the Job class: \n\nif other.a == this.a: return this.b - otherJob.b \u2192 so this would order such that when a's are equal, smaller b's come first? Because if (this.b - other.b) is negative, then this job comes before. Because how the comparator works in Java's priority queue. Wait, a comparator returning a negative, zero, or positive int determines the ordering. The priority queue, as a min-heap, will sort elements such that the comparator returns ordering determines which is 'smaller' to be first. Since in the Job's comparator:\n\nWhen two Jobs have the same a, the job with smaller b is \"less\" than the one with larger b. So in PQ, they are ordered in such a way. But when placed in the PQ, which is a min-heap, so the head has the smallest (a, b) first. That is, sorted by a then b in ascending.\n\nHowever, for the job Q (the second Queue), the code does new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder()), which means that the PQ will act as a max-heap for the b's. So jobQ is a max-heap of the b's. \n\nTherefore, when inserting, it will insert so that the largest b comes first. So the first element in the priority queue (when we call poll) is the max b.\n\nThus, in Fortran's implementation, the jobQ needs to be a max-heap of the b's.\n\nSo, the main data structures:\n\n- An list of jobs sorted by a (and then b) \u2192 sorted list.\n\n- current index tracking where we are in the sorted list.\n\n- A max heap (jobQ) of their b's.\n\nNow, creating the max heap. Let me see how to implement that in Fortran. Let's see:\n\nWe can create an array for the heap. Each time add an element: insert into the array and then sift up.\n\nWhen removing, take the first element, replace with the last and sift down.\n\nSuppose we have a module which can handle the max-heap. Alternatively, write within the program but functions that perform heap insert and heap extract max.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write a separate module or functions.\n\nBut for simplicity in code, perhaps write helper functions using modules.\n\nAlternatively, here's the approach for the code steps:\n\nVariables:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nRead the N jobs into arrays (a and b arrays); sort them.\n\nThen, the jobs are stored in an array of structs (in Fortran, a derived type).\n\nSort the array with a and then b in the sort.\n\nInitialize current index as 1 (since 1-based in Fortran)\n\nThe jobQ is a max-heap of type integer.\n\nImplement functions to:\n\n- add to the heap.\n\n- extract the maximum.\n\nThe steps then are:\n\nFor each day from 1 to M:\n\n- while current index is <= N, and the current job's a <= day:\n\n   add that job's b to jobQ.\n\n   current index +=1.\n\n- if heap is not empty, then extract the maximum and add to cnt.\n\nWait, this loop could process all jobs a <= current day before proceeding to extract elements. This would be correct, as in the original Java code where the while loop runs as long as the job.a <= i.\n\nWait, in the Java code, at each day:\n\nThe while loop takes all jobs with a <= current day (i) and adds to jobQ, then proceeds until q is empty, or the next job's a is larger than i.\n\nBut in my plan, since the jobs are sorted, then when the current job has a <= i, all prior jobs with a <=i have already been considered. The current index points to the next job that could be a candidate (maybe not yet processed). So the code can process all the jobs with a <= day.\n\nWait in the Fortran approach, perhaps the while loop is handled as:\n\nWhile current index <= N, and job(current index) has a <= current day \u2192 add to heap, increment index.\n\nBut once the a exceeds current day, leave.\n\nThen, after adding all possible jobs, we can take the max from the heap.\n\nThus, this approach would be as efficient, because when the jobs are sorted, we can process them in order, so for each day, the while loop just moves the index until a exceeds.\n\nThis way, the entire code is O(N log N) for the sorting, and O(N log (something)) for the heap operations. Since each job is added once to the heap, then each heap insert is O(log K), where K is the current heap size. Since every step, adding a job to the heap and possibly removing one, the total heap operations are O(N log N). The main loops would have a total steps of N (processing the jobs in the while loop over days).\n\nThis should be manageable in Fortran. \n\nNow, the code steps in Fortran:\n\nFirst, define a derived type for Job:\n\ntype jobtype\n    integer :: a, b\nend type\n\nThen, reading N and M, then reading N jobs into an array of jobtype:\n\ninteger :: N, M\ntype(jobtype), dimension(:), allocatable :: jobs\nread(*,*) N, M\n\nallocate(jobs(N))\n\ndo i =1,N\n    read(*,*) jobs(i)%a, jobs(i)%b\nend do\n\nSort the jobs:\n\nTo sort the jobs by ascending a, then ascending b. \n\nIn Fortran, we can use the merge sort algorithm, or use the intrinsic function. Since the standard library has a Sort subroutine which can sort with a custom comparison function.\n\nAlternatively, use the IEEE library functions. \n\nWait, in Fortran, for Fortran 2003 and above, we can use the ISO module for qsort or other things? Not sure. Alternatively, we can use a bubble sort with a compare function. But better to use quicksort implemented via the library.\n\nAlternatively, the simple way is to use a user-written subroutine to sort the array. \n\nWait, in Fortran, you can write a sort function. Let me think:\n\nMaybe the easiest way to sort the jobs as follows:\n\nFirst, define a subroutine to swap elements.\n\nThen, a comparison function that takes two jobs, compares their a, then b.\n\nThen, perform a Quicksort in Fortran using pointers and the compare function. \n\nAlternatively, let's implement a sorting routine with the following function:\n\nFirst, let's sort the jobs in place with quicksort.\n\nAlternatively, use an Integer Array that is the index 1 to N, and sort those indices according to the criteria, then loop through them in that order.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest is to write a simple bubble sort, but perhaps that's too slow for large N. Assume N is up to 1e5? Not sure, but in coding competitions, the constraints on N and M are usually manageable.\n\nHmm, need to better way.\n\nAlternatively, use the following steps:\n\nWrite a routine (or procedure) that sorts an array of jobtype using selection/insertion sort or quick.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function to sort with a compare function. Wait, Fortran 2018 has features for object-based sorting, but maybe the standard approach here is to use a manual sort.\n\nIn any case, here's how:\n\nFirst, let's create a subroutine sort_jobs that sorts an array of jobtype as per the criteria.\n\nSuppose:\n\nsubroutine sort_jobs(jobs, N)\n    type(jobtype), dimension(N), intent(inout) :: jobs\n    integer, intent(in) :: N\n    integer :: i, j\n    type(jobtype) :: temp\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        do j = i+1, N\n            if (jobs(i)%a > jobs(j)%a .or. (jobs(i)%a == jobs(j)%a .and. jobs(i)%b > jobs(j)%b)) then\n                temp = jobs(i)\n                jobs(i) = jobs(j)\n                jobs(j) = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nWait this is a naive selection sort here, comparing each pair and swapping. That would be O(N^2) which is too slow if N is like 1e5, but in the original problem, perhaps the constraints are tight. Wait, for programming challenge problem like atcoder ABC137 D (the D problem is probably N up to 1e5 or so), then an O(n^2) sort would time out.\n\nHmm, so this approach won't work. Need a more efficient sorting method.\n\nThus, need to implement a Quicksort algorithm for the job array.\n\nAlternatively, sort using a method with O(n log n) time.\n\nLet me think: in Fortran, implementing quicksort is possible. Here's a possible plan:\n\nWrite a recursive subroutine quicksort that partitions the array.\n\nWe need to write compare function that defines the ordering. Since it's a derived type, you can't directly use the default comparison, so have to implement the compare within the sort.\n\nHere's a possible implementation for Quicksort on the job array:\n\nsubroutine quicksort(a, lo, hi)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: a(*) ! pointer-based? maybe not as straightforward.\nWait perhaps in the jobtype array?\n\nWait the parameter should be an array of jobtype.\n\nHmm, but:\n\nWait the quicksort function will take an array of jobtypes, and the boundaries lo and hi.\n\nRecursive sort.\n\nWait perhaps in Fortran:\n\nLet me find an example. \n\nAn example of a QSort function for a simple array: perhaps start with the following:\n\nLet's write a recursive function for Quicksort.\n\nBut I have to define a way to partition the jobtype array.\n\nAlternatively, here is a possible code:\n\nsubroutine quicksort(array, first, last)\n  type(jobtype), intent(inout) :: array(first:last)\n  integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n  integer :: p\n  if (first < last) then\n    p = partition(array, first, last)\n    call quicksort(array, first, p -1)\n    call quicksort(array, p+1, last)\n  end if\nend subroutine\n\nfunction partition(ar, first, last)\n  type(jobtype), intent(inout) :: ar(first:last)\n  integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n  integer :: i, j, pivotindex\n  type(jobtype) :: pivotelement\n\n  pivotindex = first\n  pivotelement = ar(pivotindex)\n  i = first+1\n  j = last\n\n  do while (i <= j)\n    do while (i <= j)\n      ! Compare ar(i) with pivot. If ar(i) is \"less than or equal\", then increment i else break.\n      if ((ar(i)%a < pivotelement%a) .or. &\n          (ar(i)%a == pivotelement%a .and. ar(i)%b < pivotelement%b)) then\n          i = i+1\n      else\n          exit\n      end if\n    end do\n    do while (i <= j)\n      ! similar for j\n      if ((ar(j)%a > pivotelement%a) .or. &\n          (ar(j)%a == pivotelement%a .and. ar(j)%b > pivotelement%b)) then\n          j = j-1\n      else\n          exit\n      end if\n    end do\n    if (i < j) then\n      ! swap i and j\n      call swap(ar(i), ar(j))\n      i = i +1\n      j = j -1\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  ! swap pivot with j (b/c j < i)\n  call swap(ar(pivotindex), ar(j))\n  partition = j\nend function\n\nsubroutine swap(a, b)\n  type(jobtype), intent(inout) :: a, b\n  type(jobtype) :: temp\n  temp = a\n  a = b\n  b = temp\nend subroutine\n\nWait, perhaps that's an implementation. The partition function selects the first element as pivot, and arranges elements so that the ones less than the pivot are before, and higher are after. \n\nThe comparison is based on the a and b:\n\nFor a job to be considered less than the pivot:\n\nEither a is smaller, OR (a equal AND b smaller).\n\nThat's exactly the order we need (since in Java, when a are equal, it sorts by b in increasing order: so the job with smaller b comes first, so in the sorted list, that job would come before the other).\n\nWait in the comparator, when the other a is equal, the \"this.b - other.b\" \u2192 if it's negative, then the job comes first. So, if this.b < other.b \u2192 the compareTo returns negative, which in the priority queue (min heap) will order the job earlier in the pq. So the overall sort is ascending on a, and then on b. So the quicksort partition function here is correct because we are moving elements with a < pivot's a or a equal and b < pivot's b to the left.\n\nTherefore this partitioning method produces the desired order.\n\nOkay, so that's the sort part.\n\nNow, the next job is the max heap for jobQ.\n\nImplementing a max heap in Fortran.\n\nThe heap will be an array where each element's children are at 2*i+1, 2*i+2, etc.\n\nWait:\n\nTypically, a binary heap can be stored as an array. \n\nThe elements are stored from index 1 to the heap size.\n\nEach element at position i has left child at 2*i, right child at 2*i+1 (but that's if starting from 1). \n\nAlternatively, some people use starting index as 0, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based.\n\nTherefore, the code for the heap can be managed as follows.\n\nWe need to represent the heap as a dynamic array, but in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be allocated. Let me see:\n\nWe can have:\n\ntype heap\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: heap\n    integer :: size \nend type\n\nOr perhaps, since in each step, we can manage it as an array and dynamically resize, but that's complicated. Alternatively, preallocate a large enough array and track the size.\n\nAlternatively, initially, since the maximum possible N is up to say 1e5 (if problem constraints), then declare a large array with size up to N. \n\nAlternatively, use an array that can grow. But Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays easily, unless we use allocatable arrays and reallocate them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nInitialize the heap with a sufficient size (like, N is the max size, so allocating an array of size N, since each job can be added to the heap at once).\n\nWait, but how many elements can the jobQ have at most?\n\nAt any time, all jobs (up to N) can be added to the jobQ. But probably, it's acceptable to preallocate the jobQ array to be at least N elements.\n\nThus:\n\nLet's represent the heap as an integer array:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: job_heap\ninteger :: heap_size =0\n\nInitialize with allocating heap as N in size.\n\nallocate(job_heap(1:N))\n\nProcedures:\n\nSubroutine add_to_heap(value):\n\n   heap_size = heap_size +1\n   job_heap(heap_size) = value\n   call sift_up(heap_size)\n\nsubroutine sift_up(child)\n   while child >1:\n       parent = child /2\n       if (child < parent \u2192 but for max-heap):\n\nWait, let's think.\n\nThe sift up procedure for a max-heap:\n\nWe want to maintain the invariant that parents are >= children.\n\nSo when inserting a new value at position i (child index):\n\nWe compare with parent (i/2). \n\nIf current value is larger than parent, swap them and continue.\n\nThus:\n\nsubroutine sift_up(i)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: i\n    integer :: parent, temp\n    temp = job_heap(i)\n    parent = i / 2\n    while (parent >=1 and job_heap(parent) < temp) then\n        job_heap(i) = job_heap( parent )\n        i = parent\n        parent = parent /2\n    end while\n    job_heap(i) = temp\nend subroutine\n\nWait, perhaps the loop is better written as:\n\ncall shout:\n\ninteger :: parent\nparent = i /2\n\n    do while (i >1 .and. job_heap(parent) < temp)\n        job_heap(i) = job_heap(parent)\n        i = parent\n        parent = parent/2\n    end do\n\nthen assign job_heap(i) = temp.\n\nHmm, perhaps that code would work.\n\nThen, the add_to_heap is as above.\n\nThe other function is to extract the max element.\n\nsubroutine extract_max()\n\n    if (heap_size ==0) then return error but stop.\n\n    result = job_heap(1)\n\n    swap heap(1) with heap(heap_size)\n\n    heap_size = heap_size -1\n\n    call sift_down(1)\n\n    return the value.\n\nWait the code steps would be:\n\ninteger function extract_max()\n    integer :: temp\n    if (heap_size ==0) then\n        write(*,*) 'heap is empty'\n        stop\n    end if\n    \n    extract_max = job_heap(1)\n    temp = job_heap(heap_size)\n    job_heap(heap_size) = extract_max\n    heap_size = heap_size -1\n\n    if (heap_size >=1) then\n        job_heap(1) = temp\n        call sift_down(1)\n    end if\nend function\n\nWait, that might not be completely accurate. More precisely:\n\n1. The first element is the max. \n\n2. Swap it with last element. \n\n3. Reduce heap_size by 1 (so the last element is now the first, but will be sifted down).\n\n4. Then, call sift_down from the root.\n\nThe sift_down function ensures that the element at position i is sifted down to its correct place.\n\nSift down:\n\nThe sift down starts at position i. \n\nCompare the node with its children.\n\nWe choose the largest between the node and its children. \n\nIf the node is smaller than child with the maximum, swap with that child and continue downward.\n\nThus, code for sift down:\n\nsubroutine sift_down(i)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: i\n    integer left, right, maxindex, temp\n    do\n        left = 2*i\n        right = 2*i+1\n        maxindex = i\n        if (left <= heap_size and job_heap(left) > job_heap(maxindex)) then\n            maxindex = left\n        end if\n        if (right <= heap_size and job_heap(right) > job_heap(maxindex)) then\n            maxindex = right\n        end if\n        if (maxindex == i) then\n            exit\n        else\n            temp = job_heap(i)\n            job_heap(i) = job_heap(maxindex)\n            job_heap(maxindex) = temp \n            i = maxindex \n        end if\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in code, the loop could be written with variables.\n\nPutting this all together, necessary code:\n\nMain Program Steps:\n\n1. Read N and M\n\n2. Read N jobs, store in jobs array.\n\n3. Sort the jobs by a then b.\n\n4. Initialize the current job index = 1.\n\n5. Initialize the jobQ heap. \n\n   allocate(job_heap(1:N)) and heap_size =0\n\n6. Initialize cnt=0\n\n7. Loop for each day from 1 to M:\n\n   a. While current_index <= N and jobs(current_index)%a <= day:\n\n   - add jobs(current_index)%b to the jobQ's heap \n\n   - current_index +=1\n\n   - end loop.\n\n   b. If heap_size >0:\n\n   - add extract_max() to cnt.\n\n   end if.\n\n8. After all days, print cnt.\n\nNow, putting all these together with the code.\n\nNow, let's think about possible issues.\n\nIn Fortran, the modules for the sorting and heap functions need to be properly defined.

Also check for all parameters. \n\nWait, inside the main program:\n\nVariables like current and the loop over days. Also, note that 'i' in the read loop may not be declared.\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn reading the N jobs:\n\ndo loop over i from 1 to N: need to declare i.\n\nIn the main program:\n\ninteger i \u2192needs to be declared.\n\nThus, in main program, we can have \n\ninteger :: i, N, M, day, cnt=0, current =1, heap_size=0\n\nWait, in the program variables:\n\n    integer :: N, M, day, cnt=0, current =1\n    type jobtype ...\n\nneed:\n\n    integer :: current =1, heap_size =0\n    integer :: i \u2192 perhaps.\n\nWait in the first do loop:\n\n    do i =1,N \u2192 if i is not declared.\n\nThus, need to declare variables:\n\nInside the outer program block:\n\ninteger :: N,M, day, cnt=0, current=1\ninteger :: i\n    type jobtype ...\n\nAlso, when 'day' is a loop variable, it's okay in the loop.\n\nOther variables like in the contained procedures:\n\nIn the main program's scope, variables such as job_heap, which is an allocatable array.\n\nWait the job_heap is declared as:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: job_heap(:)\n\nThen, initializing with allocate(job_heap(N))\n\nAlso, the heap_size is initialized as 0.\n\nThe procedures add_to_heap and sift_up etc. are in the contain module of the main program.\n\nWait in the code above, the contained subroutines indeed have access to the variables job_heap, heap_size? Because in Fortran, when you use CONTAINS, the functions have access to the parent's variables. Wait no, the contained functions have access to the variables declared in the parent program:\n\nWait in our write above, the contained functions like add_to_heap reference job_heap and heap_size, which are indeed variables from the main program.\n\nYes, this is correct.\n\nNow, does all variables exist?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code may have some syntax issues.\n\nLet me check the partition function (the call to swap_jobs(a(i), a(j)), for example: in the swap_jobs, the parameters are passing by value or by reference?\n\nIn Fortran, variables are passed by reference by default.\n\nThus, the swap_jobs subroutine works.\n\nAnother important thing: the heap in the Fortran code is initially allocated to size N (allocate(job_heap(N))), so that it's big enough. However, when elements are added, it's possible to reach a capacity of N. So the code should work.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nConsider a simple case like N=2, M=3, where:\n\nJob 1: a=1, b=5\n\nJob 2: a=2, b=10.\n\nThen on day 1:\n\nAll available are jobs[1], which has a=1 <=1.\n\nAdd 5 to the heap.\n\nThen extract the Max (5). So cnt becomes 5.\n\nDay 2:\n\nAdd the job with a=2. So add to heap (now 5,10) \u2192 but since it's a max heap, after adding 10, when extracted, that's the max 10. So cnt is 5+10=15.\n\nDay3:\n\nNo new jobs (a=2 is <=3, but all jobs are processed). So add nothing. Extract 5 \u2192 but no, since in day 2's after processing, the job after 2 is current=3 (since after adding job1 and job2), then for day3, job_count is already beyond N.\n\nWait the jobs in order (sorted) would be job1 then job2.\n\nOn day3:\n\nCheck current=3, which is beyond N (2), so nothing added. \n\nThen if the Heap's elements are the remaining (since day2 extracted the 10, then day3 would have what?\n\nWait let's take day-by-day steps:\n\nInitialization:\n\nheap_size is 0, current=1.\n\nDay1:\n\nenter loop while current=1 <=2 and a (1le 1):\n\nyes. add job1's b (5) \u2192 heap now size 1 \u2192 [5]\n\nThen current=2.\n\nAgain check, next current is 2, job a=2 <=1? No. (Because day is 1. So the second loop terminates.\n\nThen, since the heap has 1 element, extract 5, so cnt=5.\n\ncurrent is now 2.\n\nDay2:\n\nLoop: current is 2. Check a is 2 \u22642 \u2192 yes.\n\nAdd job2's b (10) \u2192 heap size 2.\n\nNow the heap elements (after insertion):\n\nAfter adding 10 to the heap (current size was 1 [5], then new element 10. When inserting:\n\nheap_size becomes 2. Then sift up is called at position 2 (the new element):\n\nParent is 1.\n\nCompare 10 vs 5 \u2192 since parent (5) is smaller \u2192 swap, so position 2 (element 5 \u2192 no, wait:\n\nWait after adding, sift_up is called at 2:\n\ntemp is 10.\n\nParent is 1 \u2192 job_heap[1]=5. Since 10>5 \u2192 swap them. So job_heap[2] becomes 5, job_heap[1] is 10. \n\nThe new value (10) moves to position 1, and sift_up checks parent, which is 0 (floor(1/2)=0). So loop exits. \n\nThus, the heap after adding job2 is [10,5].\n\n current increments to 3 (now beyond N=2).\n\nThus exit the while loop.\n\nThen extract_max:\n\nthe first element is 10. \n\nextract_max:\n\nswap with last element (10,5). Heap_size becomes 1. Then sift_down:\n\ntemp is 5 (the element being moved down).\n\nAfter the swap:\n\nheap is [5,5].\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, during extraction:\n\nThe initial job_heap is [10,5].\n\nextract_max takes job_heap[1] \u2192 10.\n\nThen, replace it with the last element (5), set heap_size to 1.\n\nNow the new array is [5], and since heap_size=1, sift_down is not needed.\n\nThen cnt becomes 5+10 \u219215.\n\nheap is now just [5].\n\nThus, this is correct.\n\nDay2's contribution is 10.\n\nOn day 3:\n\ncurrent is 3 \u2192 which is over N, so loop doesn't add any.\n\nThen extract the heap's max, which is5.\n\nSo cnt now 15 +5= 20.\n\nTotal cnt:20.\n\nBut according to the algorithm:\n\nWait the code is for each day, extract the maximum B (after adding the available jobs). So for M=3 days:\n\nday 1: 5 added, and extracted once (5).\n\nday2: add 2's job (10), extract that. (total 5+10=15)\n\nday3: the job queue has the previous job1's b? Wait, no. job2's b was added to the heap on day2. When extracted on day2's step.\n\nAfter day2, the heap after extraction is [5]. on day3, the loop over job (current is 3, no new jobs.\n\nso the heap has that 5. Extract it \u2192 added to cnt (total 15+5=20).\n\nThus the output would be 20.\n\nIs that correct according to the problem?\n\nIn this case input:\n\nN=2 M=3\n\nJobs:\n\n1 5\n\n2 10\n\nThen the optimal schedule would be:\n\nDay1: do job with b=5 (since no better options).\n\nDay2: do job2 (10).\n\nDay3: the remaining job is job1 (a=1), but already done? Or is the jobs list processed once? Wait the problem allows taking each job only once. So since job1 is already chosen at day1, can't choose again. So during day3, there are no jobs left except those not processed.\n\nWait original problem: The jobs are to be handled one per day (up to N days? Or for all days until the M days, choosing at the most N jobs.)\n\nThe job can be chosen once (since they are all jobs being read and stored, each only once).\n\nSo in this example:\n\nDays 1\u21923, each day can choose:\n\nDay1: any a<=1 (job1) \u2192 choose the max (5).\n\nDay2: a<=2 \u2192 jobs 1 has been taken, then the available jobs is job2 (a<=2). choose its 10.\n\nDay3: no new jobs (since job2 is a=2 \u22643, but job2 was already processed in the jobs array\u2014 added to heap in day2. Because when current_index was 2 (job2's a is 2) in day2.\n\nWait on day2's processing step, the job2 is current_index=2, a=2 <= day 2 \u2192 added into the queue. \n\nThen the current is incremented to 3, beyond N.\n\nThus, for day3, no new jobs. The jobQ at day3 has only job1's b (maybe I'm confused here).\n\nWait original code's flow:\n\nWhen adding jobs on day3, they can only add jobs with a <=3, but since their current pointer is already beyond the list (current=3), nothing added. \n\nSo the only available job in jobQ on the first loop:\n\nAfter days1:\n\nheap has [5]\n\nAfter day2:\n\nqueue had 5 and with job2's b (10). So before extraction on day2, the max is 10 (so queue has [10,5]), then extracted. The extract leaves the heap as [5].\n\nThus, on day3, the heap contains the 5 (from job1's B?\n\nNo, that job1 was added on day1. But the a is 1, which is <= day3, so why wasn't it considered again?\n\nAh wait, no.\n\nThe jobs are only added to the queue once when current index is processed. So once a job is added to the queue (job1 in day1), but after that it's removed from the main jobs list (since they are processed in sequence). Thus, even after current is set beyond N, nothing can be added again. So job1 is only added once. So in day3's queue's job_Q is [5], but on day1 5 was already taken? Wait no.\n\nWait the actual process for the jobs array:\n\nAfter current is advanced beyond N, no way to get more jobs. So job1 was processed on day1, then job2 on day2. Both are added to jobQ (in their respective days). Thus after day1's extraction, the job1's job is \"used\" (since it's taken out of jobQ when you call extract_max). \n\nThus the 5 is taken out and added to cnt. The jobQ after day1 has only 5? Wait no. \n\nAfter day1:\n\nthe jobQ had added 5 from job1, then you extracted_max added 5 \u2192 the count is now 5. \n\nThe jobQ becomes empty after extraction (since after removing 5, the size was 1 now 0.\n\nWait, the heap_size was 1 \u2192 after extract_max, heap_size becomes 0. Thus:\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nIn Day1: after adding job1 (b=5) to heap, the queue has size 1. \n\nThen, after extracting, heap_size becomes 0.\n\nThus, when we get to Day2:\n\nWe first process current jobs:\n\ncurrent is 2 (after previous increment to 2, but in the first loop). \n\nWait in the Java code's code:\n\nAfter adding job1 to heap:\n\ncurrent becomes 2 (after the first loop for day1.\n\nTherefore, in the Day2 loop:\n\ncurrent is 2 (<= N=2, and job2's a=2 <=2 \u2192 so add job2's b=10 to the jobQ.\n\nthus:\n\nadd_to_heap(10), heap_size becomes 1.\n\nthen current becomes 3 (exceed N). \n\nThus heap is now has 1 element (10).\n\nThus, extract_max() subtracts and adds 10 \u2192 total 5+10 is 15.\n\nThen, Day3:\n\ncurrent is 3 \u2192 can't add anything. \n\nThen extract_max: if heap is empty, no.\n\nWait but after day2 extraction, the heap was size 1 \u219210. extracting it reduces to 0.\n\nThus, for day3:\n\nthe jobQ is empty, as after day2's extraction.\n\n thus the day3 would get nothing, so total is 15.\n\nWait this is conflicting.\n\nAh, this is a different result than previous. So what's the error?\n\nAh, my mistake in the previous steps.\n\nLet's recalculate the sample step-by-step:\n\njobs: [job1 (a=1, b=5), job2 (a=2, b=10)].\n\nSorted as per a then b.\n\nProcessing each day:\n\nInitialization:\n\ncurrent=1, heap_size=0, cnt=0.\n\nDay1:\n\nLoop while current <=2 (yes), and job1 has a=1 <=1. \n\nAdd job1's b (5 to jobQ).\n\ncurrent becomes 2.\n\nCheck again: job a=2\u202f\u22641? No. So stop the while loop.\n\nThen, since there is heap_size >0 (1):\n\nextract_max() \u21925 \u2192 cnt=5.\n\nheap_size is now 0.\n\ncurrent is 2 now.\n\nDay2:\n\nLoop:\n\ncurrent=2. job a=2 \u22642 \u2192 yes.\n\nAdd job2's b (10) to the heap \u2192 size becomes 1.\n\ncurrent increments \u2192 3.\n\nLoop now current is 3 >2 \u2192 done.\n\nNow, since heap is non-empty (size 1):\n\nextract_max() \u219210 \u2192 cnt=5+10=15.\n\nheap now size 0.\n\nDay3:\n\nloop for adding jobs:\n\ncurrent is 3 \u2192 no jobs added.\n\nsince heap_size 0 \u2192 nothing done.\n\nTotal cnt=15.\n\nThus the correct answer is 15, so the code would return 15.\n\nWait in my previous calculation I had a mistake in the heap handling.\n\nAh the problem comes in code logic of the Fortran code's handling of extract_max.\n\n The error in previous pseudo-code was that I thought after adding both jobs on day2 (job2's b=10 was added in day2).\n\nIn day2:\n\nafter adding job2 (which is the second job), the job is added to the queue (heap now has 10).\n\n then, when extract_max is called, we take 10 (max), so it's added to cnt, and the heap size becomes 0.\n\n So on day3, there are no jobs in the heap.\n\n Thus the total is 5+10=15.\n\n But according to the code in the Q example:\n\nThe correct answer would be 15. So if the code is to return 15.\n\nThen in the code that I wrote above, the code is correct?\n\nYes. The error in my initial calculation was when thought that after adding, the previous 5 was still present, but in day1's extract reduces the b5 to be gone.\n\nThus the example's code should output15.\n\nThus, our code implementing that logic.\n\nHence, the code should work.\n\nPotential other edge cases:\n\nAnother test case: N=1, M=1, Job (a=1,b=3). \u2192 will yield 3.\n\nAnother case: N=2, M=2, Jobs (a=1,b=1; a=1,b=3 \u2192 sorted. \n\nsorted by a then b: so first job is (1,1), then (1,3).\n\n day1 process:\n\n add both jobs: because current starts at 1:\n\n first, job's a=1<=1 \u2192 add to jobQ b=1 \u2192 current 2. \n\n next, job at current 2: a=1 \u22641 \u2192 add b=3 \u2192 current 3.\n\n so the heap now has 1 and3 (since the heap is max, so after adding 3, sift up would make it max 3).\n\n when extract_max gives3 \u2192 so day1 adds 3.\n\n day2's processing:\n\n check jobs where current is 3 (exceed N=\u202f2), so nothing added.\n\n but extract_max from existing (the two jobs were added to the queue in day1's processing?\n\nNo, no:\n\n Wait:\n\n The current was set to3 at the end of day1's while loop.\n\n On day2: current is3 (beyond N \u2192 stop.\n\n thus the jobQ has no elements on day2 (since after the first day's extract:\n\nAfter day1's extraction:\n\n On day1, after adding both jobs:\n\n the heap initially gets 1 (S1), then add 3.\n\n The heap after adding 3 would be:\n\n add 1: after adding, sift_up (position2) \u2192 compares with parent 1 (position1 if 2/2=1). 3 >1 \u2192 swap with 1's position. \n\n Thus heap would be (3,1) in gueue.\n\n extracting on day1: the first item is3 \u2192 so removed, causing (1 to be left).\n\n Then, after extraction:\n\n the heap now has 1 (heap_size reduces from 2 to1).\n\n thus, when day2 is coming, we have to decide.\n\nWait at day2's loop:\n\nNo new jobs added. \n\nThe queue now has 1 (because the first extraction took 3, but after that, there is 1 in the queue.\n\nSo on day2's processing:\n\n if the heap_size is 1 \u2192 we extract the1 \u2192 cnt is 3+1=4.\n\n but according to the problem statement:\n\n According to the schedule:\n\n Day1 can choose between the two jobs; with max b3 and that's the choice.\n\n Day2 has no new jobs since a=2 isn't possible but the second job's a is 1, but it has already been added to the queue's job in day1.\n\n Thus day2 can extract the remaining job (b=1).\n\n Thus the total is 3+1=4.\n\n Thus for this case, the code would indeed give 4.\n\n Thus, the code works correctly here.\n\nThus, the code looks correct.\n\nI think this should be the translated code."
