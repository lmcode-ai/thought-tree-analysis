For example, if the input is '3 5', splitting into characters would give ['3', ' ', '5'], so inp[0] is '3', inp[1] is ' ', which would cause m = parseInt(\" \") throw an error.

So to avoid that, when storing, ans(i) just the first m characters are set, but in fortran strings are of fixed length, so trailing characters would be spaces?

Wait 'trim' removes trailing blanks. So for example, if the string is 'BWB---', and with length 5 (but stored in a 100 char array), trim would leave it as is.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's look at what the Java code does. The problem is probably related to generating some chessboard-like pattern with 'B' and 'W' characters, except where there's a '-' which stays as is. The input reads two integers n and m, then n lines each of m characters. For each character in the string, if it's '-', leave it. Otherwise, depending on the sum of the indices (i+j) mod 2, decide between 'B' or 'W'.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to read inputs in Fortran. The Java code uses BufferedReader, so in Fortran, we can read from standard input using read(*,*) statements. But we need to parse the first line which has two integers. Then, for each of the next n lines, read strings of length m.\n\nWait, the Java code splits the first line into a list by splitting each character. Wait a second, looking back at the Java code's first line: \"buf.readLine().split(\"\")\". Oh, that's splitting the entire first line into individual characters, so each character is an element of the array. Therefore, the first line has exactly two characters? Or does it? Wait, no. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nWait the problem probably is that the first input line is two integers n and m separated by a space, so splitting by split(\" \") would be correct, but in the Java code, the user used split(\"\"). That would split each character, but that would split the entire first line into individual characters, which may cause an error if the first line has things like '5 10' because splitting each character would give an array of '5', ' ', '1', '0', etc. That can't be right, so maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the problem says the code is from codeforces_445_A, so maybe the user made a typo. Let me think again.\n\nWait the Java code is for Codeforces problem 445A. Let me check that problem's input format. Let me recall: the problem probably requires reading a grid, but the first line is two integers n and m. Wait the problem says \"In the first line there are two integers \u2013 n and m (1 \u2264 n,m \u2264 100), the board size.\" So codeforces 445A problem mentions that the first line has two integers, then next n lines each of m characters. So the Java code's first line's split(\"\") is wrong because splitting into every character would lead to separating the numbers. For example, if the input is '3 5', splitting into characters would give ['3', ' ', '5'], so inp[0] is '3', inp[1] is ' ', which would cause m = parseInt(\" \") throw an error. So perhaps the Java code has a bug here?\n\nWait that can't be. Therefore the user must have a typo here. The correct way should be to split on whitespace, so \"split()\" with no parameter, which in Java's case, the default is splitting by whitespace. So maybe the original code had a mistake, but given the context, maybe in the problem it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's first line is a string of two digits with no spaces? Like n is a single digit followed by m as single digit. For example, in problem 445A, perhaps the first input line is a string like \"35\", but that would be split into \"3\" and \"5\", so the code works. But in general cases, that's not the case.\n\nWait given that it's a programming competition problem, maybe the correct code is using split(\" \") instead. Perhaps the code's initial line is a mistake, but I should proceed with the given Java code. Since the user asks to translate their code as given, even if there may be an error, we have to translate as per the code.\n\nSo let's proceed. The Java code's first line reads the first line, splits into individual characters (each character becomes an element of the array). Then it takes the first element as n, second as m. But in some cases that's wrong, but given the code as written, let's translate exactly that.\n\nTherefore in Fortran, first we need to read the first line as a string, split into individual characters, then take the first two characters as n and m. Hmm. How to do that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is intended to read the first two characters of the first line as n and m? Like if the first line is something like \"n m\", but that requires that the first two characters are digits for n and m.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct as is because in the problem statement the first line was two single-digit numbers. So for example, input like \"3 5\" would be split into [\"3\", \" \", \"5\"], so the first element is '3', second is ' ', so that's invalid. Therefore, I think maybe the code has a bug, and they meant to split by spaces, by using split(\"\\\\s+\"). But perhaps the problem's first line actually has no space? Like \"35\" for 3 and 5? That would split into ['3','5'], making n=3, m=5. So if that's the case, the input is two single-digit numbers concatenated, but that's a bit strange. Maybe the problem requires that the first line is two digits (each n and m are single-digit). Hmm, but in Codeforces problem 445A (Let me check), okay let me think: the problem is called \"Viennaazed\", like a chessboard with some crosses and so on. Let me see:\n\nYes, from the problem statement (445A): \n\nInput: first line has two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100) \n\nThen n lines follow, each with m characters. \n\nAh, so the first line is two integers separated by space, so in the code, if the code above uses split(\"\"), then splitting individual characters would cause error if, say, m is two digits like 10. E.g. input \"3 10\" would be split into ['3', ' ', '1', '0'], so the first character (n's value) is the first element '3', which is okay. The second element is the space, which when parsed would give m as Integer.parseInt(\" \"). But that's an error. Therefore the original code must have a mistake. But assuming the code is correct as provided, the user wrote the code that way, so we have to translate as per that code. But in reality, that code wouldn't work for inputs with m over 9. Therefore, perhaps the problem actually had n and m given as single-digit numbers in the first line? But that's not specified in the problem's constraints, so it can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is in the original code, but the user wants us to translate it as given. So for the code translation, even if the code is wrong, we proceed as per the user's request. \n\nWait, perhaps the code has split(\"\", 2) or something else? Alternatively, maybe the code is correct if the first line is written as two digits, like \"123\" would imply n=1 and m=2 (third is part of m?), but this is unclear. Since this is a code translation task, perhaps the code is intended the way it is, so proceed with that.\n\nIn any case, moving forward. The task is to translate the code as provided.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nFirst, read the first line of the input, split into characters (each character is a part of the first line's string), converting n and m. Since in Java, \"split \"\" splits into individual characters, so the first line's first character is n's string, second is m's string. For example, if the first line is \"35\", then n=3, m=5. But if the first line is \"3 4\", then it would split into \"3\", \" \", \"4\" then n=3, m is parsed from the space (invalid). So that's a bug in Java code, but assuming the problem input first line is exactly two digits with no separators, then it works.\n\nTherefore, for the translation to Fortran, the first line must be read as a string, and parse the first character for n, second for m.\n\nAlternatively, in cases where n can be multi-digit?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct only for n and m being single digits. Assuming this is the case in this problem's test cases, but the code may be wrong otherwise. Since the user is translating, we must follow their code's logic.\n\nTherefore in Fortran:\n\nRead the first line as a string (the entire line) then take the first character, convert to integer for n, second character for m.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading lines can be done with read(*, '(A)') string.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Declare the variables needed.\n\nBut let's structure the Fortran code step by step.\n\nStarting with the main program.\n\nProgram codeforces_445A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, m\n  character(len=100) :: line\n  ! ... declare the ans array. Since we need to store n strings each of length m, so char array with shape (n, m)\n  character(len=100), dimension(100) :: ans\n  ! but since the maximum m can be 100, as per problem's constraints.\n  integer :: i, j\n  character(len=1) :: c\n  ! etc.\n\nWait, need to read first line's first two characters, then n and m.\n\nWait, so first read the entire first line as a string.\n\nRead(*, '(A)') line\n\nn = ichar(line(1:1)) - ichar('0')  ! but only if line(1:1) is a digit\nm = ichar(line(2:2)) - ichar('0')\n\nBut that's valid only if both first two characters are digits. If they are not, it's an error.\n\nWait but the original code in Java reads the first two characters of the first line as n and m, even if not a space-separated. So the code can only process n and m as the first two characters of first line as characters for each, even if they have to be digits. \n\nSo, assuming that the first line's first two characters are the digits for n and m. So the code in Fortran should do that.\n\nWait n and m can be up to 100, so two digits? So maybe the first line is like \"99 99\" but then the first character is 9 (n is 9), second is 9 (m is 9), and then rest is garbled. That would be wrong.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Perhaps the Java code was incorrect, but given that, we proceed as the user's code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Java code is using, by \"split(\"\") the entire line, so every character becomes an entry in the array, so for a line like \"10 12\", split by empty string would create an array of the first '1', then '0', ' ', '1', etc. Then n would be the first element (1), then m would be the second element (0), leading to n=1 m=0 which is invalid, so the code is wrong. So there's probably a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to split with the default (split by whitespace). \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's split by nothing, but using a regex like \"\\\\s+\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's intentional, and the problem's first line must be two single-digit numbers with no space. So for example input \"12\" implies n=1, m=2. So the code works. In that case, the Fortran code can proceed.\n\nThus, moving code as is.\n\nSo the first line is read, then n and m are first two characters. So in Fortran:\n\nRead the first line:\n\nread(*, '(a)', advance='no') line\n\nBut perhaps using a get edit descriptor? Wait, not necessary. Let me think:\n\nWe can read the first line as a string, then extract first two characters.\n\nThen, in Fortran:\n\nread(line(1:1),*) n\nread(line(2:2),*) m\n\nThat would work if line(1:1) is a digit.\n\nSo, code so far:\n\nprogram codeforces_445A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, m, i, j\n  character(len=200) :: firstline  ! must be enough to hold the first line\n  character(len=100), dimension(100) :: ans ! arrays for the answers\n  read(*,*) firstline  ! Wait, no, because reading with read(*,*) will read until the next space, but a line. Alternatively, read(*,'(a)') firstline. \n\nWait, in Fortran, the correct way to read a whole line is with:\n\nread(*, '(a)') firstline\n\nBut the line might be any length. However in the problem, the first line is two digits, so perhaps the firstline can be length 10? Let's declare firstline sufficiently long, maybe 100.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: firstline\n\nread(*, '(a)', advance='no') firstline  ??\n\nAlternatively, using list-directed input but that can be tricky for strings.\n\nWait, for a character string using list-directed input, the entire line is read, but in some cases it may have varying behaviors. To read a whole line, it's better to use an explicit format.\n\nWait the correct code would be:\n\nread(*,'(a)') firstline\n\nThis should read the entire first line into firstline until the newline.\n\nThen, parse first two characters of firstline as n and m.\n\nn = ichar(firstline(1:1)) - ichar('0')\n\nSimilarly for m?\n\nAlternatively, read them with:\n\nread(firstline(1:1), *) n\n\nread(firstline(2:2), *) m\n\nThat's better. Since the format * will let integer to be read from the character.\n\nWait firstline(1:1) is a single character, which is a digit, so read into n. Same for m.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce we have n and m, then proceed.\n\nThen, for each of the next n lines.\n\nThe code in Java loops from i=0 to n-1, reads a string, processes each character, then appends 'B' or 'W' as required.\n\nIn Fortran, each line is a string, and for each character position j (starting from 0?), need to process.\n\nWait in the Java code, the loop for j is from 0 to m-1 (since in the loop 'for (int j=0; j < m; ...)', since the string length is m (each line has m characters).\n\nSo Fortran:\n\nWe need to read each of the next n lines, so for each i from 1 to n (since arrays in Fortran are 1-based?), or since in the Java code indices are 0-based? Hmm, in Fortran arrays can be 1-based unless specified otherwise. So the code will probably need to loop from 1 to n, and for each line:\n\nRead the line into a string variable, say line_str.\n\nThen loop j from 1 to m characters. For each index in the line_str (from 1 to m), process accordingly.\n\nWait let's see.\n\nIn the code:\n\nfor each line (say each row):\n\nstr is the current line's string (of length m).\n\nThen, for each character at position j (0-based up to m-1? since j < m) \n\nIf the current character is '-', append it.\n\nElse, if (i + j) mod 2 ==1 ('B' or 'W'). Wait the Java computes (i +j) mod 2.\n\nWait the Java code loops over lines starting from i=0, and each character's index j starting at 0. So i (row index) ranges from 0 to n-1 inclusive. j (column) from 0 to m-1 inclusive.\n\nThus, the total (i+j) will be 0 up to n+m-2.\n\nSo in Fortran loops:\n\nWe'll have to adjust for 1-based indices. For the Fortran code's row number (variable i), we can loop from 1 to n. Similarly columns j from 1 to m.\n\nThus, i rows in Fortran : 1-based.\n\nSo the formula (i + j) mod 2 will give different parity compared to the Java code's 0-based indices.\n\nWait : Let's see:\n\nIn Java for i=0, j=0: (0+0) mod2 is 0 => 'B' else (1 mod2)=1. Wait the Java code has:\n\nif (i + j is even: (i+j) %2 is 0 \u2192 else, so then append B. Else append W?\n\nWait the logic is:\n\nif (i +j) %2 ==1 \u2192 'W', else 'B'\n\nWait looking back:\n\nIn Java's code, inside the else (character is not '-'):\n\nif (i+j) %2 ==1 \u2192 append 'W' else append 'B'.\n\nBecause:\n\nelse { // meaning the character is NOT '-', \n\nif (i+j, mod2=1 \u2192 'W'\n\nelse \u2192 'B'\n\n}\n\nWait so the color is determined by (i + j) %2 ==1 \u2192 W, else B.\n\nIn Java's code, the rows are 0-based. So for a row i starting at 0, columns j starting at 0, then (i+j) mod 2 gives the parity.\n\nTo replicate this in Fortran, where the row indices are 1-based, so in code:\n\nif in Fortran, row is 1-based, the indices would be i and j starting from 1, so i+j would be one higher than in the Java. Which would flip the parity.\n\nFor example, the (0,0) position in Java (i+j=0 \u2192 mod even \u2192 B \u2192 (1,1) in fortran is i=1, j=1 \u2192 sum 2 mod 2=0 \u2192 even \u2192 B.\n\nSo that's same parity. Because the Java and Fortran's 0/1 based give the same i+j mod 2 because (Java's (i+j) = (Fortran_i -1) + (Fortran_j -1) = For_I + For_j -2, so mod2 is same as (For_i + For_j) mod2. Because (a -2) mod2 is same as a mod2. So when (Fortran_i + j) mod2, same parity as (Java's i+j). So the formula can be used directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can just use (Fortran's i + j) mod 2, because even if it's i-1+j-1, mod2 gives the same as (i + j) mod2 minus (2 mod2 =0), so yes.\n\nTherfore the parity condition remains the same mod2.\n\nThus the code can use (i + j) mod 2.\n\nNow, processing each character in the current row's string.\n\nThe main part is to loop through each character in the current row's string.\n\nCollecting the characters into a string, then storing in ans array.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nFor each line (i from 1 to n):\n\nRead the line into a string, say s (length m), but in the input lines, each line is exactly m characters.\n\nThus:\n\nallocate line_str for length m.\n\nBut in Fortran, fixed arrays, perhaps we can assume m is up to 100, so:\n\nparameter (maxm=100)\n\ncharacter(len=maxm) lines( max ), ans( max )\n\nWait perhaps define variables:\n\nWe have to read each line into a variable. So suppose:\n\nloop:\n\ndo i = 1 to n:\n\n   read the line into a character array of length m.\n\n   process each character from j=1 to m:\n\n      if s(j:j) is '-', leave as is.\n\n      else:\n\n          if (i + j) mod 2 ==1 \u2192 'W'\n\n          else \u2192 'B'\n\n     build a new string for ans(i).\n\nStore into ans(i).\n\nThen, after all lines, output all ans(i).\n\nNow, in Fortran, for the processing:\n\nFirst, store each line in a character array s of length m.\n\nSuppose for each line, after reading into s, loop through each character.\n\nInitialize a temporary string, say temp, which is going to be character*(m), then:\n\ntemp = ''\n\ninitialize, then build it character by character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to process each character into the string.\n\nIn Fortran, array of characters can be processed.\n\nSample code outline:\n\nAfter reading firstline for n and m:\n\nparameter(maxn=100, maxm=100)\n\ninteger, parameter :: pic_len = maxm\n\ncharacter(len=pic_len), dimension(maxn):: ans\n\nthen:\n\nread the lines:\n\ndo i =1 to n\n\n   read(*, '(a)', advance='no') line  ! line is a character string of length m? Or read as line(len=pic_len)\n\nWait let me define variables better.\n\nMaybe, for picture strings:\n\ncharacter(len=100), dimension(100) :: ans \n\nthen loop for i=1 to n:\n\n   read(*, '(a)', advance='no') temp_str \n\nWait, no, the \"(a)\" may require closing the line. Alternatively, read(*, '(a100)') temp_str(1:m)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps read the entire line as a string of length m, but we have to make sure.\n\nWait each line has exactly m characters. So when reading in Fortran, an edit descriptor like a(m)' code: \n\nread(*, '(a100)') line_str \n\nThen we can take the first m characters (since the remaining can be ignored)\n\nAlternatively, if the input ensures that each line has exactly m characters (as per problem's description), then line_str is of length m.\n\nWait but in Fortran, variables can be declared with length m, but m must be known at compile time. But in the problem, m is variable, determined at runtime. Thus, the code has to use strings of a sufficient fixed length, or handle dynamically.\n\nSince in this problem's constraints, m can be up to 100, then we can declare all strings as length 100, and read into it, use first m characters. So:\n\nfor each i, read the line as a max length 100.\n\nLet's assume variables are set as:\n\nparameter(max_len=100)\n\ncharacter(len=max_len) :: temp_str  ! temporary string for each input line \n\ncharacter(len=2) :: firstline  ! no, wait earlier. firstline must be at least 2 characters for n and m. Let's make it len=20 to be safe. \n\nWait for the first line, the firstline variable must be able to process the first two characters as n and m, but the rest can be anything. But the code only reads the first two characters. So firstline can be of len=2, but in case the full line has more characters (like spaces) it's okay. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\n\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5f00\u59cb:\n\nprogram codeforces_445A\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: maxn=100, maxm=100\n    integer :: n, m\n    character(len=200) :: firstline  ! enough to read first line, even with spaces\n    character(len=maxm) :: temp_str\n    character(len=maxm), dimension(0:maxn-1) :: ans ! assuming 0-based indexing for compatibility with Java's approach?\n\n    read(*, '(a)') firstline\n    read(firstline(1:1),*) n\n    read(firstline(2:2),*) m  ! \u63d0\u53d6\u524d\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u4f5c\u4e3an\u548cm\n\n    ! \u73b0\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u8bfb\u53d6\u884c\n    do i = 0, n-1  ! \u5982\u679c\u662f\u89810-based\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\n        read(*, '(a)') temp_str ! \u8fd9\u4f1a\u8bfb\u5165\u6574\u4e2a\u884c\u5230temp_str, \u524dm\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u6709\u6548\n        ! \u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u5230ans(i)\n        ! \u5982\u679ctemp_str\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\uff1f Or temp_str is length 100, and the input line can be up to 100 characters.\n\n        character(len=maxm) :: current_line\n        current_line = temp_str(1:m)  ! \u53d6\u524dm\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\n        ! \u68c0\u67e5\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u8d8a\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u6839\u636e\u9898\u76ee\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6bcf\u884c\u6b63\u597d\u662fm\u5b57\u7b26\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6ca1\u95ee\u9898\n        ! \u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u884c\uff0cans(i)\n\n        character(len=maxm) :: res_str\n        res_str = ' '\n        do j = 1, m\n            character :: c = current_line(j:j)\n            if (c == '-') then \n                res_str(j:j) = c\n            else \n                if (mod(i + j, 2) ==1) then \n                    res_str(j:j)='W'\n                else \n                    res_str(j:j)='B'\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ans(i) = res_str(1:m)\n    end do\n\n    ! \u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u6240\u6709ans\u7684\u5143\u7d20\n    do i=0, n-1\n        print *, trim(ans(i))   !

Also, variables like ans's indices. \n\nWait in this code sample, ans is declared as 0-based (from 0 to maxn-1). However in Fortran arrays are by default 1-based unless we declare them as starting at 0 (Using DIMENSION(0:...)). Wait, the default is 1-based. \n\nWait in the line \"dimension(0:maxn-1)\" \n\nYes, in Fortran declarations, you can specify the lower and upper bounds. So dimension(0:maxn-1) will have indices from 0 to maxn-1.\n\nSimilarly for j in loops from 1:\n\nWait in the code above, the current_line(j:j) when j runs from 1 to m. That is okay because Fortran strings are 1-based.\n\nThus, for the first character, j=1 is the first character.\n\nWait the calculation for (i + j): the variable i is the loop index starting from 0 to n-1 (0-based row), j is 1-based column. So the current_line's j is 1-based.\n\nSo the sum i (0-based) plus j (1-based) would give, for (i=0, j=1): 0+1=1 \u2192 mod2 gives 1 \u2192 W. \n\nBut according to Java's code, since Java uses 0-based for both i and j (j runs from 0 to m-1). So in Java, that position would be (0+0)=0 mod2 \u2192 0 \u2192 'B'.\n\nThis discrepancy would cause different results.\n\nAh! Here's a problem.\n\nBecause the Fortran's code in the current outline has:\n\ni ranges over 0 to n-1 (to be similar to Java's 0-based). j is from 1 to m (Fortran is 1-based). \n\nSo the total (i + j) is:\n\nJava's i and j are both 0-based. So for 0,0 \u2192 0.\n\nFortran: when i=0 (same as Java's 0), and j=1 (Java j=0 \u2192 corresponds to Fortran j=1?), That gives i+j=1+0=0 ??\n\nWait no, to match the Java's indices:\n\nIn Fortran's 0-based row (i) and Java's 0-based row, that's okay.\n\nBut the column in Java for character at position j is 0-based up to m-1. So Java's j corresponds to Fortran's (j+1)?\n\nWait, no. The columns in Java are j from 0 to m-1. The Fortran for each character of the current_line (stored as current_line(1:m)), is stored starting at 1. So \n\nJava char at position j: current_char_val.\n\nIn Fortran, the same position is current_line(j+1)? No, no. If current_line's string in Fortran is \"abc\", then the first character (position 1) is 'a', second is 'b', so for Java's j=0 \u2192 position 1 in Fortran.\n\nThus:\n\nThe column index j in Java (0-based) corresponds to column index (j+1) in Fortran.\n\nThus, the Fortran code's variable j runs from 1 to m, and Java's j is (Fortran_j -1).\n\nConsequently, for two positions i and j:\n\nJava's (i+ j) = i + (Fortran_j -1)\n\n=> (Fortran_j -1 + i)\n\nWhich when considering mod2:\n\n[Fortran_j -1 + i) mod2 equals (Fortran_j + i -1) mod2.\n\nWhile in our current Fortran code, using i+F_j mod2.\n\nWhich would give different parity.\n\nSo the calculation is off by one.\n\nHmm, so there's a problem here. To fix this, the formula in the Fortran code must account for the difference in indices.\n\nLet me think:\n\nWe need (Java's i + Java's j) mod 2. Since in Java:\n\ni ranges from 0..n-1 (rows), j from 0..m-1 (columns)\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nrows are 0-based (i=0 to n-1): same.\n\ncolumns are 1-based (j = 1 to m)\n\nThe Java's j is equal to (Fortran's j -1).\n\nSo:\n\nJava's (i + j) = i + (Fortran_j -1).\n\nSo the formula should be (i + (Fortran_j - 1)) mod 2.\n\nThus, in Fortran code:\n\nif mod(i + (Fortran_j -1), 2) ==1 \u2192 then 'W', else 'B'\n\nAlternatively, using mod(i + Fortran_j -1,2) ==1 \u2192 check.\n\nTherefore to match Java's condition, we need to subtract 1 from the Fortran's j.\n\nIn the current code's condition line mod(i+j,2) \u2192 it's wrong. Should be mod(i +j -1,2).\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif(mod(i + (j-1), 2) ==1) then... \n\nAlternatively, mod( (i + j) -1,2) \u2192 same as mod(i+j -1,)\n\nYes. So the code in the condition must use (i +j) minus 1.\n\nAlternatively, to have the same effect as Java:\n\ni's in 0-based, Fortran j is 1-based, so (i + (j-1)) mod2 \u2192 that is correct.\n\nThus:\n\nThe code's condition should change from mod(i +j,2) to mod( (i + (j-1)), 2)\n\nSo in the fortran code:\n\n            if (mod( i + (j -1), 2 ) ==1) then \u2192 W else B\n\nYes, that will replicate the same condition as Java. \n\nThis was an oversight in earlier thoughts. So we have to adjust this.\n\nLet's update the code:\n\nInside the inner loop (for j in 1 to m):\n\n            if (c == '-') then \n                res_str(j:j) = c\n            else \n                if (mod(i + (j-1), 2 ) ==1) then \n                    res_str(j:j) = 'W'\n                else \n                    res_str(j:j) = 'B'\n                end if\n            end if\n\nYes, that will correct the discrepancy between the indices.\n\nTherefore this correction is needed.\n\nAlso, the output: since ans is a 0-based array (0 to n-1), we have to index accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, in fortran, when using print *, the string will print with no problem, but if there are trailing spaces, they will be printed. But since the current_line string has exactly m characters ( assuming the input lines are exactly of length m). Therefore, when we build res_str(j:j) correctly for the first m positions, when we store in ans, it's:\n\n   ans is dimensioned as (0:maxn-1) each of len maxm\n\n   ans(i) = res_str(1:m)\n\nWait in the current code sample, perhaps we have to pad it or not.\n\nWait in the code currently:\n\nAfter building res_str's characters, res_str holds in its first m characters the desired string (the rest may be default or whatever). Then, when doing ans(i)= res_str(1:m).\n\nBut in Fortran's character assignment:\n\nans(i) = res_str(1:m)\n\nso yes.\n\nThen, when printed with print *, trim(ans(i)), the trim removes trailing spaces. But actually, the string is exactly m characters (without any space if there's no space in the input). Because res_str was set character by character for each of the m positions. So each position is filled with 'B','W' or '-', so no trailing spaces. The res_str's first m characters would form the exactly length m string, so storing in ans(i). Thus, when using print *, ans(i) would print exactly the string without truncation, as it's m characters long.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you print with * asterisk, it will output the full contents, so if ans(i) is of length 100 and only the first m characters are valid, the rest would show garbage. So to avoid that, when storing, ans(i) just the first m characters are set, but in fortran strings are of fixed length, so trailing characters would be spaces?\n\nWait no: when we do character(len=100) :: res_str : initially, the variable is initialized with spaces, but in the inner loop, each char at position j, from 1 to m is set explicitly, so positions after m are untouched. Thus, when stored in ans(i), which also has length 100, the rest are default (space). So, when printed, the whole 100 characters would be displayed, which is wrong. So we have to make sure the string is only printed up to m characters.\n\nSolution: print only the first m characters of the string.\n\nThus the print statement should be:\n\nprint *, ans(i)(1:m)\n\nAlternatively, set the length of the output format to be m characters.\n\nBut maybe, when printing in Fortran, using, print *, trim( string ), but since the string's first m are the desired characters, and trailing spaces are after m, then the trim function will eliminate them, resulting in the m characters displayed.\n\nWait 'trim' removes trailing blanks. So for example, if the string is 'BWB---', and with length 5 (but stored in a 100 char array), trim would leave it as is. However, only the first m characters are required (filled), but in practice the Fortran's res_str was set to up to the m-th character, so spaces or whatever are after would be white spaces. Thus, the trim would cut those.\n\nThus, print*, trim(ans(i)(:m)))\n\nWait, the code could be:\n\nprint *, ans(i)(1:m)\n\nBut that would cause the compiler to see ans(i)(1:m) as a section. In some fortran versions, that may need explicit length.\n\nAlternatively, code as:\n\nwrite(*,'(a)') ans(i)(1:m)\n\nTo ensure only m characters are printed.\n\nThus, modifying the output loop:\n\n    do i=0, n-1\n        print *, ans(i)(1:m)\n    end do\n\nAh, but in the code:\n\nans(i) is of length 100 (or maxm), so ans(i)(1:m) is the string from first to m-th positions.\n\nYes, that would be the right code.\n\nNow, stepping through the variables again.\n\nNow, considering the declaration for ans:\n\nEarlier I had thought to use a zero-based array. Alternatively, could make the array one-based. Let's see which is better.\n\nUsing one-based arrays might align with Fortran conventions more, but the core issue is to match indices correctly.\n\nSuppose we use one-based arrays and loops.\n\nLet me try rethinking with 1-based (Fortran default), avoiding zero-based indices:\n\nprogram codeforces_445A\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: maxn=100, maxm=100\n    integer :: n, m\n    character(len=200) :: firstline  \n    character(len=maxm), dimension[maxn] :: ans  ! one-based for rows, 1:maxn\n    integer :: i, j \n\n    read(*, '(a)') firstline\n    read(firstline(1:1),*) n \n    read(firstline(2:2),*) m \n\n    do i=1, n\n        character(len=maxm) :: temp_str\n        read(*, '(a)') temp_str ! note, this will read the entire line (, possibly more than m characters, but since the line's length is exactly m according to problem)\n        character(len=maxm) :: current_line = temp_str(1:m)\n        character(len=maxm) :: res_str ! \u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\uff1f\n\n        ! \u521d\u59cb\u5316res_str\u4e3a\u957f\u5ea6maxm\u7684\u7a7a\uff1f\n        ! \u5176\u5b9e\u53ef\u4ee5\u9010\u4e2a\u8d4b\u503c\n        do j=1, m\n            character :: c\n            c = current_line(j:j)\n            if (c == '-') then \n                res_str(j:j) = c\n            else\n                if (mod( (i-1) + (j-1), 2 ) == 1) then \n                    res_str(j:j) = 'W'\n                else\n                    res_str(j:j) = 'B'\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ans(i) = res_str(1:m)\n    end do\n\n    do i=1, n\n        print *, ans(i)(1:m)\n    end do \n\nend program \n\n\u8fd9\u6837\uff1a\n\n\u8fd9\u91cc, 'i' \u662f\u884c\u76841-based\u7d22\u5f15, \u6240\u4ee5 Java\u7684i corresponds\u5230 Fortran\u7684i - 1.\n\n\u4f8b\u5982, \u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u884ci=1, \u5728Java\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684i+ j\u7684\u7b2c0\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n\u5982\u679c Java's row index is 0 to n-1 \u2192 Fortran\u7684i\u662f1\u5230n. \n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728 condition \u4e2d, \n\n \u5728Java's (i + j) \u7684i\u662fjava\u7684i (0-based), j\u662f java\u7684j (0-based).\n\n\u800c\u5728 Fortran\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0ccorresponding\u7684i\u662f Fortran_i = java_i +1 \u2192 Java_i = Fortran_i -1.\n\n\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684j earlier\u7684\u8c03\u6574\uff1a \u7531\u4e8eFortran's j is 1-based, \u90a3\u4e48 Java\u7684 j\u7b49\u4e8e Fortran's j\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e -1.\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\u603b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f0f\uff1a\n\nJava\u7684i+ j\u7684\u548c\u662f : (Fortran_i -1) + (j-1) = Fortran_i + j -2.\n\n\u8fd9\u4e0e\u8c03\u6761\u4ef6 mod( ( Fortran_i + j -2 ), 2 ) ==1 \u2192 ?\n\n\u5728 Fortran\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff1a\n\nmod( (i-1) + (j-1),2 ) \u2192 sum equals (i+j -2).\n\nmod( (i+j -2), 2) ==1 ?\n\n \u662f\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64, \u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\uff1a\n\n if ( (i+j-2) mod 2 ==1 \u2192\u5219 'W', \u5426\u5219 'B'\n\n \u8fd9\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\uff1a\n\n\u5982\u679c (i +j \u7684\u548c-2) mod2\u662f1 \u2192 same as (i+j \u7684\u548c mod2) \u7b49\u4e8e 1 mod2 \u2192?\n\nWait:\n\n\u56e0\u4e3a (i+j-2) mod 2, \u53ef\u4ee5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a (i+j mod 2) -0 mod2.\n\n\u56e0\u4e3a 2 mod2\u662f0\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c (i+j -2 mod 2 ) = (i+j mod2 ) - 0 \u2192 \u4e5f\u5c31\u662f (i+j mod2) -0?
