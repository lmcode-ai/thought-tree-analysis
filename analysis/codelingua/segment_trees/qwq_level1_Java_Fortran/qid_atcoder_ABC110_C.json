    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the code does. The Java program seems to check if the order of characters in two strings S and T is the same for every unique character. If all characters follow the same order in both strings, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise \"No\". \n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n1. Read two strings, S and T.\n2. For each character in the alphabet (a-z):\n   a. Find its index in S. If not present, skip.\n   b. Get the corresponding character in T (from that index).\n   c. Check in both strings that every occurrence of this character appears in the same positions as the corresponding T's character.\n3. If all checks pass, output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. \n\nFirst, getting input. In Fortran, to read a line, can use a combination of read(*, '(A)') statements. But need to be careful with string lengths. The strings can be of any length, up to some limit like 10^5, but perhaps here we can assume an arbitrary size. Let's use character arrays with a max length, say 100000, but maybe better to use adjustl to get rid of leading spaces?\n\nWait, but in Java's nextLine(), it reads the entire line. So for Fortran, using the g0 format to read the line until newline? Hmm, maybe using a temporary string, then trimming it.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nInitialize S and T as character arrays with a large size, like 10^5, but maybe just 256 for simplicity unless needed otherwise. Wait, the problem might not limit length. Hmm. Let me think. The problem constraints for ABC110 C (since it's AtCoder problem C) probably have S and T being up to 2*10^5 characters each. So better to dynamically allocate. But Fortran 90+ can use allocatable arrays.\n\nAlternatively, assuming the problem's constraints aren't too strict, but perhaps in code submission, using a dummy size. Wait, perhaps in Fortran code, we can read a line into a string of length 1e5? Let me think:\n\nFirst, declare character(len=100000) :: s, t, etc. But perhaps better to use variable-length strings? Wait, in Fortran, strings can be handled with character variables without explicit length limitations. Wait, Fortran has the character(len=:), allocatable type in modern versions. So for Fortran 2003 or 2008:\n\nRead lines like:\n\n   read*, s (but that would read until space?), so maybe better to use list-directed is not good, better use the explicit method. Wait, in Fortran 2003 onwards, you can read a line with the get command.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, I can read the first line into s and T:\n\nMaybe:\n\n   character(len=100000) :: s, t\n   read(*,'(a)') s\n   read(*,'(a)') t\n\nBut this may have issues with trailing spaces, but in programming contest context, usually lines are read exactly as input. But perhaps use the 'a' format with a * to read until the end, for example:\n\nAlternatively, the read statements can be:\n\nread(*,'(a)') s; but s's length is fixed. To handle arbitrary lengths up to a maximum, perhaps setting len=100000 as per the problem's constraints (assuming the problem allows maybe up to 1e5 chars). Since AtCoder problems may have up to 1e5 characters, let me use 1e5.\n\nBut maybe the problem's constraints for this problem (ABC110 C) specify that S and T are of the same length. Wait, looking at the Java code, the loops iterate up to S.length(), so I think in the problem statement, S and T must be of the same length? Because the Java code uses T.IndexOf(t, idx), which would be an issue if the lengths differ.\n\nAssuming that S and T are of the same length.\n\nSo, first step:\n\nDeclare variables. The letters a-z can be stored as an array of strings. In Fortran, we can have a character array holding the 26 letters.\n\nThen, the main loop over each letter in A (from a to z). For each letter s in A:\n\n   Get sIdx = the index of s in S. If not found, continue.\n\n   The corresponding character in T is T(sIdx). \n\nWait, but in Fortran indices start at 1. So F90 uses 1-based, which matches Java's substring. The first character is at position 1 in Fortran.\n\nWait Java uses 0-based, but in the Java code, the code uses S.indexOf(s), which finds first occurrence (0-based). Then, after that, the code proceeds. \n\nWait let's look at the Java code again:\n\nfor each s in A (each character from a to z) {\n\n   sIdx = S.indexOf(s) \u2192 the index of first occurrence. If s is not in S, skip (so sIdx <0 \u2192 continue).\n\n   Then get t = T.charAt(sIdx); because since S has s, then T's position must be the same as the first occurrence?\n\nWait the problem's check is to ensure that for all instances of each character 's', the relative order in S and T are the same.\n\nWait the code's logic might be checking that for a character 'ch', the positions in S where ch appears must correspond exactly to the positions in T where t appears \u2014 where t is the character in T at the first occurrence of S of 's'. \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is to ensure that for the same sequence of occurrences in S, the corresponding character in T are in the correct order. Maybe there's a better way to explain the algorithm, but perhaps I just need to translate the steps as per the code.\n\nThe main loop over each s in A:\n\n   s is a letter from a-z. \n\n   find s's first occurrence (sIdx). \n\n   if not found \u2192 skip to next character. \n\n   else:\n\n      get the corresponding character in T (T's sIdx is the same index as S). Let that be t.\n\n      Then check in S that every occurrence of s must match with occurrence of t in T.\n\n      So they need the positions of s in S must exactly coincide with the positions of t in T? Or that in every position where s occurs in S, the corresponding T must have t, and vice versa?\n\nWait the loop in Java:\n\nWithin the loop over s (a character in A):\n\nthen, for that s (the first occurrence's position sIdx)\n\n     set t is T's character at sIdx.\n\n     Then, they have a loop incrementing idx from 0 (initial 0?), initially at 0.\n\nWait, code in Java:\n\nint idx = 0;\n\nwhile ( idx < S.length() ) { \n\n   if ( S.indexOf(s, idx) >=0 ) { \u2192 if there's an occurrence of s starting from idx:\n\n      current pos is pos = S.indexOf(s, idx). \n\n      check that in T, T's index of t starting from idx must be the same as this pos.\n\n      if different, then set res to false and break. \n\n      Else, set idx to pos+1 to check next positions.\n\n   } else if ( T.indexOf(t, idx)>=0 \u2192 meaning there is an occurrence of t before end in T from idx onwards:\n\n      then this is a problem \u2192 because S has no s in that idx where T has t?\n\n      So that would fail \u2192 res = false?\n\n   else \u2192 break?\n\nWait let me walk through the code:\n\nThe while loop processes each occurrence of s and t. \n\nThe idea is that all positions of 's' in S must correspond exactly to all positions of 't' in T, and vice versa. So both strings have the same sequence of 's's and 't's, in the same positions.\n\nBecause, for each s (current character being checked), the code starts at idx=0, then in each loop step:\n\n1. Find next occurrence of s in S starting at idx (current position is pos_s = S.indexOf(s, idx)\n\n2. If such a pos_s exists:\n\n   a. check whether T's next occurrence of t (the first occurrence in T from idx) is the same as pos_s.\n\n   If not \u2192 then order mismatch. So the characters s in S and t in T are not in the same positions, so return false.\n\n   b. Then, move the idx to pos_s +1 to continue searching.\n\n3. If there is no s in S here:\n\n   Then check if there is a t in T at or after idx. \u2192 If yes \u2192 since S doesn't have s here, but T does have t, that's conflict \u2192 so return false.\n\n   If no \u2192 then exit the loop (having checked those idx).\n\nThe loop continues until all required checks pass.\n\nThus, this code is checking that all occurrences of s in S and t (in T's first occurrence position's character) must occur exactly in the same positions, and vice versa.\n\nThe code continues this check for all s in the 26 letters. \n\nThus, the logic is: For each character present in S (as represented by their first occurrences?), the positions of s in S and T's corresponding t must exactly match. \n\nWait, but why do we use the first occurrence's T character (t = T.charAt(sIdx))?\n\nBecause, for s's first occurrence at position sIdx in S, in T the same position is t. So for all following occurrences of S's s must correspond to T's t's in the same positions. So the code is ensuring that for each occurrence of a certain character in S, that in T the same position must have the corresponding character (for s's t.) Thus, this would require that the sequences of s and t are the same.\n\nWait but how? Because in S the s occurs in a certain sequence, and in T, the t must exactly match those positions. Hence, the code is checking that the relative ordering of the characters between S and T is consistent for each character's sequence.\n\nHmm, perhaps this code will correctly detect when the two strings have the same order of characters.\n\nNow to translate this into Fortran.\n\nFirst steps:\n\nRead two strings S and T of the same length. (assuming they are same length, as per problem's constraints).\n\nFortran code outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100000), allocatable :: s(:), t(:)\n    logical :: res=.true.\n    integer :: len, i, sIdx, idx, pos_s, pos_t\n    character(len=1, kind=1) :: current_char\n\n    ! Read the input strings.\n    write(*, \"(' Please input S and T? ')') not really, just read them)\n    ! Assuming S and T are of same length.\n    read(*, '(A)') s_str\n    read(*, '(A)') t_str\n    ! Wait, since the strings can be of any (but same?) length, need to store the characters arrays.\n\n    len = len_trim(s_str)\n    allocate(s(len))\n    allocate(t(len))\n    read(s_str, *) s\n    read(t_str, *) t\n    ! Hmm, no, this might not be right. Wait maybe better to use loop to convert.\n\nWait Fortran strings are a bit tricky. Let me think in Fortran 90:\n\nMaybe read the entire line as a string, then process each character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array:\n\nRead the input lines into s and t arrays.\n\nAlternatively, since characters are involved, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s_line, t_line\nread(*, '(A)') s_line\nread(*, '(A)', end=10) t_line\n \ninteger :: len_s, len_t\nlen_s = len_trim(s_line)\nlen_t = len_trim(t_line)\n\nThen, if they are different lengths, what happens? The problem's condition may require that they have same length. Probably, for this problem. \n\nBut the original code in Java could work for variable lengths?\n\nWell in the Java code:\n\nfor when checking S.length(), so assuming that T also has same length?\n\nElse, the code may have undefined behavior? \n\nProbably the problem requires that the input strings are of the same length, hence in the code they are handled that way.\n\nThus, Fortran code must first check that lengths are same?\n\nBut perhaps assuming problem constraints.\n\nSo proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, store s_line and t_line as the entire string.\n\nThen:\n\ncharacter(len=*), parameter :: letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\nWe can create an array of characters from a-z. \n\nThen, loop over each of the 26 characters.\n\nThe code would need:\n\nDo i_char = 1, 26\n\n   current_char = letters(i_char:i_char)\n\n   ! Find the first occurrence of current_char in S.\n\n   sIdx = index(s_line, current_char, back=.false.)\n\n   if (sIdx == 0) cycle loop.\n\n   t_char = t_line(sIdx+1: sIdx+1)  \u2192 because Fortran strings are 1-based.\n\n   Then, need to check the indices.\n\nThe loop over the string:\n\nCurrent index idx starts at 1 (since starting at zero in Java is 0-based?).\n\nWait, considering that Fortran is 1-based. So the translation of the Java code which starts 'idx=0' corresponds to idx=1 in Fortran?\n\nWait Java's S has strings with indices from 0 to length-1. Fortran is 1-based.\n\nSo in Fortran, the conversion must adjust indices.\n\nNow, the Java code starts with idx=0, which in Fortran would be 1.\n\nWait the loop in Java:\n\nwhile (idx < S.length()) { \n\nThe equivalent in Fortran would be:\n\ndo while ( idx <= len_s )\n\nBut need to track.\n\nWait here's the code steps for this part:\n\nWithin the loop over each current_char (a to z):\n\n  sIdx is first occurrence of current_char in S (using Fortran's INDEX function).\n\nIf sIdx not found \u2192 continue to next letter.\n\nElse:\n\n   t_char is the character at t_line(sIdx: sIdx) (position sIdx in T)\n\n   set res to .true. initially?\n\nWait the code sets res= true at start, then for each check, sets to false on any failure.\n\nBut in the loop over each letter, if any letter's check fails \u2192 res becomes false and breaks.\n\nNow, the inner loop over idx:\n\nset idx = 1 (since in Java's code was 0, so for Fortran to match the initial value as Fortran's first position is 1. Wait original code starts with idx=0 (Java's first element is 0).\n\nHmm so need to adjust variable indices between 0-based (Java) and 1-based (Fortran).\n\nThe Fortran code must adjust the indices accordingly. Let's see.\n\nLet me think of the variables:\n\nIn Java, S is 0-based, so the first char is at 0. In Fortran, first char is 1.\n\nFor example, when we have s.line, which is length 5. Then:\n\nJava S[0] corresponds to s_line(1:1) in Fortran.\n\nJava's S.charAt(sIdx) \u2192 sIdx is the first occurrence (0-based). So in Fortran, s_line(sIdx+1: sIdx+1).\n\nSo the steps in Java:\n\nInside the letter's loop:\n\n   sIdx in Java is the first index (0-based) where the character is found in S.\n\n   So, in Fortran, first occurrence is given by index(s_line, current_char) \u2192 is the position (1-based).\n\n   So, t_char is the t_line's character at that position. \n\nNow, the inner while loop (in Java):\n\n idx = 0; //Java style (first position)\n\n while (idx < S.length()) {\n\n   pos_s = S.indexOf(s, idx) \u2192 finds the next occurrence after current idx (inclusive).\n\n   in Java, indexOf(String str, start) gives the index (0-based) from 'start' until the end. returns -1 if not found.\n\nIn Fortran, we can use INDEX(s_line, current_char, back=.false., backstr= s_line(start_index:)) \u2192 but not sure.\n\nThe function to find the first occurrence of current_char in S starting at pos 'start_idx'.\n\nWait in Fortran, INDEX function's third argument is 'back' which by default is false, so the first occurrence from the start.\n\nTo find the occurrence in the substring starting at index 'idx', in Fortran would be:\n\n   pos_s_javapos = INDEX( S_line( idx+1 : : ), current_char ) \u2192 but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, compute the position in Fortran as current_start = idx (Java) \u2192 translates to start at position current_start +1 in Fortran. \n\nLet me try to map variables:\n\nIn the loop in Fortran for the inner code:\n\nLet Java's idx be Jidx, which is 0-based.\n\nFortran's idx is Fidx, which must be set as Fidx = Jidx +1 since it's 1-based.\n\nBut rather, perhaps we can track the loop variables accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\nThe while loop (Java) starts at idx (starting at 0 \u2192 translates to Fidx starting at 1?).\n\nWait perhaps it's easier to redefine variables in Fortran to mirror the Java code's steps, just adjusting the indices for 1-based. \n\nThe inner loop:\n\nInitialize idx (Fortran variable) starting at 1 (since in Java it's idx=0 \u2192 F idx would be 1). Wait no:\n\nJava:\n\ninitialization was:\n\nint idx=0 (Java's starting position for check).\n\nWhile (idx < S.length()) {\n\nSo in Fortran terms:\n\ninitial Fidx =1, and while ( Fidx \u2264 len_s )\n\nBut let's think variable:\n\nLet me define in Fortran:\n\ncurr_ijdx \u2192 equivalent to Java's idx.\n\nSo Java's idx corresponds to F's curr_ijdx, but Java uses 0-based. \n\nSo in terms of actual code variables:\n\n idx (Java) \u2192 starts at 0 \u2192 to F's F_start =1? (since first character is pos1 in F).\n\nWait perhaps better to track:\n\nIn the inner loop, the current Java's idx (0-based):\n\ncorresponds to F's starting point of idx_jd = F's current start is (idx_j +1). \n\nHmm, perhaps for the inner loop:\n\nWe can code:\n\nF is 1-based:\n\nInitialize F_idx = 1 (start checking from position 1)\n\n  loop while ( F_idx <= len_s )\n\n  Or something like that.\n\nBut to stick to the original Java's steps:\n\n   pos_s in Java: \n\n   pos = S.indexOf(s, idx) \u2192 starting from the current idx (Java's 0-based), find s's next occurrence. \n\n   in Fortran: s_char is current_char. We need to find the first occurrence of s_char within s_line starting at position (idx_j +1)?\n\nWait, in Java:\n\n Suppose Java's idx is 5 (so starting from pos 5 in string S). Then S.indexOf(s, idx) \u2192 looks from position 5 (inclusive).\n\nSo in Fortran, the substring starting at (idx_j +1) \u2192 because the first character in position idx_j (Java) is Fortran's idx_j +1.\n\nSo the Fortran equivalent:\n\nF_start = idx_j +1\n\nthen, pos_s_in_F = INDEX( s_line(F_start:) , current_char, back=.false.)\n\nIf the result is 0 \u2192 not found. Else, it gives the position relative to F_start (i.e., the position is F_start + (pos_s_in_F) -1 ? Wait:\n\nNo. The value from INDEX(s_line(F_start:End), char) returns the position within the substring s_line(F_start:End). \n\nWait, the INDEX function in Fortran gives zero if not found, else the position within the string argument. So if the first occurrence comes in the substring starting at F_start, then the actual position is:\n\npos_s_in_F = F_start -1 + pos_sub \u2192 no, better: the result is the position from the start of the substring, so the actual position in s_line is (F_start -1) + pos_sub.\n\nWait no, the substring starts at F_start (1-based), so the first character is at position F_start of s_line.\n\npos_sub is the position from the start of the substring (i.e., from 1 to len_sub). So the position in s_line is F_start + (pos_sub -1).\n\nSo pos_s_in_F = (F_start -1 ) + pos_sub \u2192 no:\n\nWait, let me think with example.\n\nExample: original string is \"abcde\".\n\nsubstring starting at position F_start =3 would be \"cde\".\n\nIndex of 'd' in that substring is 2 \u2192 the 'd' is at position 3 + 1 (since the substring's 1st char is 3rd in the full string).\n\nWait, full string positions (1-based): a(1), b(2), c(3), d(4), e(5).\n\nSubtring s_line(3:) is \"cde\".\n\nindex of 'd' is located at position 2 in the substring, which corresponds to the original string position 4 (3+1). \n\nSo the value returned is 2, so the actual position is F_start (3) + (2-1) ? \u2192 3 +1=4. Yes.\n\nThus, the position in s_line is F_start + (pos_sub -1)  = F_start + pos_sub -1 = (3)+(2) =5? Wait 3 + (2-1)=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, so:\n\npos_s_in_F = F_start + (pos_sub -1) \u2192 wait, F_start is the start of the substring.\n\nWait perhaps:\n\npos_sub = INDEX( sub_str, current_char )\n\nif pos_sub >0:\n\nactual position is F_start + pos_sub -1 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus, the Fortran code for getting pos_s:\n\nsub_str = s_line(F_start: ) \n\npos_sub = INDEX( sub_str, current_char )\n\nif pos_sub /=0 \u2192 actual position is F_start + pos_sub-1 .\n\nElse, not found \u2192 -1 (Java) \u2192 0 in Fortran.\n\nSimilarly for T.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nLet me try to translate the while loop.\n\nOriginal loop (Java):\n\nint idx =0 \n\nwhile (idx < S.length()) { \n\n    int pos_s = S.indexOf(s, idx); // searching starting at idx.\n\n    if (pos_s >=0 ) { \n\n       same as: if found in S from idx onwards.\n\n      pos_t = T.indexOf(t, idx)\n\n       if pos_t != pos_s \u2192 then mismatch \u2192 res false etc.\n\n       else \u2192 set idx = pos_s +1\n\n    else \u2192 \n\n       check if T has t in this area: \n\n       pos_t where? \n\n       if any occurrence of t in T from idx to end:\n\n          then problem \u2192 return false.\n\n       else \u2192 break the loop.\n\n}\n\nHmm, this is getting complex.\n\nPerhaps better to proceed step by step.\n\nVariables in Fortran:\n\n For the inner loop:\n\n   initialize current_ijdx (Java's initial idx) as 0 \u2192 translated to starting at 1?\n\nWait let's define in Fortran:\n\n   f_idx = 1 (starting at first char)\n\n   then the loop continues as long as f_idx <= len_s (the length of the string)\n\nWait but the while condition in Java is idx < S.length \u2192 equivalent to f_idx <= len_s \u2192 since S's length is len_s (Fortran is 1-based).\n\nInside the inner loop:\n\n   // search S for current character starting at f_idx (Java equivalent: idx_j = f_idx -1?).\n\n   Then find next position of s in S starting at current_f_idx.\n\n   the Java's s is current_char.\n\n   pos_j_s = S.indexOf(s, (f_idx-1) ) \u2192 because f_idx in fortan is 1-based equivalent of Java's 0.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to track all variables by their Java's version, then convert to Fortran indices:\n\nLet me denote in Java variables:\n\ncurrent_letter = s\n\nt_char = T at sIdx (the first occurrence of the current_letter in S's first index.\n\nThe inner loop variables:\n\njidx \u2192 starting at 0 (Java index)\n\n loop condition: while (jidx < S.length()) \u2192 meaning that jidx can be up to jlen -1.\n\nInside the loop:\n\n first find position of 'current_letter' in S starting from jidx (Java indices):\n\npos_s_j = S.indexOf(s, jidx)\n\nif pos_s_j >=0 \u2192 exists.\n\nthen, check T's. \n\n corresponding pos_T_j = T.indexOf(t_char, jidx)\n\nif pos_T_j != pos_s_j \u2192 then returns false \u2192 break.\n\nElse, set jidx = pos_s_j +1;\n\nElse (no s found) \u2192 \n\n   then, check T's positions. Check whether there exists t_char starting at jidx.\n\n if pos_t_j = T.indexOf(t_char, jidx) \u2192 \n\nif pos_t_j >=0 \u2192 then that is, in T there is a t_char where S doesn't have s \u2192 so mismatch \u2192 returns false.\n\nElse \u2192 break loop.\n\nSo translating this to Fortran:\n\n The FORTRAN equivalent variables:\n\n The jidx in Java is current index in Java (0-based).\n\n So in Fortran:\n\n jidx = current_JJava_idx \u2192 which is j_f_idx = jidx +1 \u2192 Fortran's position.\n\nThus:\n\n We can have:\n\n fortran variables:\n\n   current_f_pos \u2192 the position being tracked equivalent to JJava's jidx.\n\n   loop over while current_f_j <= len_s_J (since Java's S.length() is equal to len_s_fortran's length.)\n\nWait maybe too convoluted.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me replicate the variables and loop structure:\n\nInitialize current_f_idx = 1 (equivalent to Java's 0):\n\nloop:\n\n   pos_s = the first occurrence of the current_letter in S starting at current_f_idx.\n\n   in(fortran) pos_s is:\n\n      temp_str = S_line( current_f_idx : len_s )\n\n      pos_sub = index(temp_str, current_letter)\n\n      if pos_sub ==0 \u2192 not found else \u2192 actual position is current_f_idx + pos_sub -1.\n\n      but if found:\n\n         pos_s_F = current_f_idx + pos_sub -1 \n\n      else \u2192 pos_s_not = -1 (Java)\n\n   So, in code:\n\npos_s_F = -1\n\nsub_pos = INDEX( s_line(current_f_idx:), current_letter )\n\nif (sub_pos >0 ) then \n\n    pos_s_F = current_f_idx + (sub_pos -1 )\n\nend if.\n\nsimilarly for T.\n\nThen:\n\nIf pos_s_F >=0 (i.e., found)\n\nthen:\n\nfind pos_t in T's equivalent:\n\n pos_t_J: \n\n Java\u2019s T is T's [0-based], so from current_f_j (which is Java's Jidx), jidx = current_f_j -1 (no, no: current_f_j is the 1-based pos, so the java's 0-based index is current_f_j-1.\n\nWait the current_f_j variable corresponds to being equal to current position in Fortran (the starting point). Java's starting point was jidx (the start for search).\n\nSo, the search through T starts at Java's current index as java_jidx = current_f_j -1 +1 ?\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe defining in terms of Java variables, but code in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n Let me try to see step by step:\n\nThe desired code in Fortran: \n\nWithin the loop over letters:\n\ndo i=1,26\n\n    current_char = letters(i:i)\n\n    initial_s_pos = INDEX(s_line, current_char) \u2192 the first occurrence in S (1-based).\n\n    if ( initial_s_pos ==0 ) cycle\n\n    t_char = s_line( initial_s_pos:initial_s_pos ) \u2192 no, wait in T_line:\n\n    t_char = t_line( initial_s_pos : initial_s_pos )\n\n    ! Now proceed with the inner loop.\n\n    res = .true.  \u2192 no, the outer res is set to true initially, but inside here.\n\n    Then, we have:\n\n    idx starts at current_f_idx1 =1.\n\n    Wait let's start with one_var(current_f_idx initialized to 1.\n\n    do \n\n      now, in each step:\n\n      -> process current_f_idx:\n\n      first check S from current_f_idx onwards for current_char.\n\n      s_pos is the first position of S.\n\n      if found, the position is s_pos.\n\n      then check in T from current_f_idx to find the occurrence of t_char.\n\n      t_pos is position found in T starting from current_f_idx.\n\n      if s_pos and t_pos exist and are not the same: \u2192 not ok.\n\n      else if s_pos found and t_pos found and same \u2192 move idx to s_pos +1\n\n      else if s not found, and T found the character: \u2192 not ok \u2192 set res = .false. and return.\n\n      else: exit loop.\n\n? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me structure the inner loop in Fortran as follows:\n\nWe can have nested loops:\n\nThe inner loop that iterates over all occurrences of current_char in S and T.\n\nInitialize:\n\ncurrent_f_idx = 1\n\n successfully_running = .true.\n\n loop continues:\n\n   do while (current_f_idx <= len_s)\n\n         Find_s_pos: \n\n           start_S from current_f_idx to end.\n\n           call index(s_line( current_f_idx : ), current_char )\n\n           if (pos_sub_S >=1 )\n\n             s_position = current_f_idx + pos_sub_S -1 \n\n           else \u2192 not found here.\n\n         Similarly for T's pos_t.\n\n         * if both exist (s found):\n\n           then check if s_pos equals t_pos.\n\n         * if s was not found:\n\n             check if there is the T's char in current_f_idx onward. If yes \u2192 then invalid.\n\n     [ etc ]\n\nThis is getting very involved. Perhaps an alternative is to replace the indices with functions and use arrays.\n\nAlternatively, to represent all positions:\n\nWait, another idea: for the current character (s):\n\n   The positions of s in S are stored as s_positions array.\n\n   The positions of t (the corresponding char from T's first occurrence in S first position) in T are t_positions.\n\n   Then compare the two arrays. If they are exactly the same \u2192 okay.\n\n   The code loops every character present in S and do this check.\n\nBut building arrays for all characters might be memory-consuming for large strings. Since AtCoder problems usually have up to 2e5 characters.\n\nBut given that Fortran can handle it (assuming arrays of 2e5 entries), perhaps this is manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each of the 26 letters:\n\n   check if the letter exists in S's string.\n\n      if yes:\n\n          collect all indices in S where the letter occurs \u2192 array s_indices.\n\n          get the first occurrence's position (pos_first) in S,\n\n          then in T, the first occurrence is the character at pos_first \u2192 t_char.\n\n          Now collect all indices where T has this t_char \u2192 t_indices.\n\n          if s_indices array and t_indices are identical \u2192 okay.\n\n          else \u2192 set res to false.\n\n          (Or, alternatively, check if the indices match for all occurrence positions. )\n\nIf any of these checks fail \u2192 return no.\n\nIf all pass \u2192 return yes.\n\nThis approach is similar but might be more straightforward to code.\n\nBut how to collect the indices of a character in a string in Fortran?\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps using loops.\n\nAlternatively, can use a loop over the entire string's length, note each position where the character appears.\n\nThis requires two loops per each character:\n\nFor s character:\n\ncollect_s_indices: initialize an array. iterate from 1 to len_s, store positions where s_char matches.\n\nsame for T and t_char.\n\nBut this would require O(L*N) where L is 1e5 and N characters (26 letters) \u2192 1e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nThis approach is more straightforward.\n\nThe code steps would be:\n\nRead S and T as character arrays.\n\nlen_s = LEN(s_line)\n\nlen_t = LEN(t_line). If not same \u2192 error (but according to problem constraints they are same).\n\nmain loop:\n\nforall char_in a-z:\n\n   if it does not exist in S \u2192 skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      / collect s_indices, which are positions in S of that char.\n\n      s_first_pos = first occurrence in S.

If not, cycle \u2192 which would skip.\n\nSo for those characters existing in S, we do the processing, else skipped.\n\nBut storing all indices each time and comparing arrays. \n\nThis approach works but needs to handle dynamic allocations. Using dynamic allocations each time (for the current character and its t_char) may be acceptable for small char sets (only 26 letters). \n\nBut even better, perhaps, can precompute the indices for each character.\n\nSince all characters are from a-z, perhaps we can precompute for each character in S their indices, and same for T.\n\nBut perhaps it's overkill. \n\nAlternatively, can use an array for each character to hold indices, but with 26 chars each up to 1e5 elements \u2192 using 26* 1e5 bits \u2192 about 2 megabytes. \n\nBut for Fortran, dynamic allocation perhaps is manageable.\n\nWait also, note that the numbers ns and nt may not be same count; if they are different \u2192 the answer is NO.\n\nHence, first check the counts. \n\nIf counts differ \u2192 false.\n\nElse \u2192 compare the lists.\n\nThus, this approach is correct?\n\nYes, this is equivalent to the original algorithm's logic, but more efficient in being same.\n\nThus, this approach may be easier to implement in Fortran.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed to implement this method in Fortran.\n\nThus, the Fortran code would look something like:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200000) :: s, t\n    integer :: pos_char, first_occurrence_s, first_pos, len_s, len_t, i\n    logical :: res = .true.\n    character(len=1) :: alphabet(26), current_char, t_char\n    integer, allocatable :: s_indices(:), t_indices(:)\n    \n\n    !

Need to make sure the indices are stored correctly.\n\nWait in the subroutine:\n\nthe intent(out) for indices should have the first dimension with unknown size, but the subroutine will allocate.\n\nWait in the calling context:\n\nThe main program first declares:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: s_indices(:), t_indices(:)\n\nthen,\n\ncall collect_indices(s, current_char, s_indices)\n\nThis should allocate s_indices appropriately.\n\nHowever, need to pass the indices as an allocatable array, and the function properly traverses and returns the array.\n\nAlso, the subroutine might have a bug in the 'count' variable: it's declared as local.\n\nWait in subroutine collect_indices:\n\n    integer :: count =0 \n\nThen, the loop increments count and stores positions in indices(count). That should work.\n\nAfter allocation, the indices array has size(n). So during loop from i=1 to len,\n\nset each indices(count) when characters match.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nThe main program then compares the sizes and the arrays.\n\nIf all are ok, then returns.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nThus, this code would be correct.\n\nBut I might have made some syntax errors.\n\nNow, the problem is that the alphabet array is initialized as characters. The Chinise_char(ichar('a') +i ) may need to be in Fortran's ASCII: char(97+i) .\n\nYes, in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: alphabet(26)\nalphabet = [ ( char( ichar('a') +i ), i=0,25) ]\n\nYes, CHAR(ICHAR('a') + i) for i from 0 to25 gives a-z.\n\nAlternatively, 'a':'z' ?\n\nAssuming that the syntax for character ranges may not work, so the explicit code.\n\nNow, the 'collect_indices' subroutine:\n\n the allocate line: allocations need to be done in some way.\n\nThe code:\n\n   n is computed as the count.\n\n   allocate( indices(n) )\n\nthen loop i from 1 to len_trim(str)\n\nand fill the indices array.\n\nBut how is the array filled?\n\ncount starts at 0.\n\nInitially, loop:\n\nfor each character:\n\n   if (match):\n\n      count +=1\n\n      indices(count) =i \u2192 yes. \n\nThis should build the array correctly.\n\nThus, the indices array contains the positions (1-based) of the target character in the string.\n\nThen, when comparing s_indices and t_indices for a given character.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nThus, this is the translated Fortran code."
