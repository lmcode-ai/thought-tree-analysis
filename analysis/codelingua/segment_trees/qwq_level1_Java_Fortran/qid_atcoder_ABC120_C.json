    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look through the Java code first to understand what it does.\n\nThe Java code is solving a problem where it counts pairs of 0 and 1 in a string such that they are consecutive but in reverse order when processed, and then doubles the count. The approach uses a stack. For each character, it's pushed onto the stack. Then, while the stack has at least two elements, it pops two elements. If they are 0 and 1 (either way), it increments the count. If not, it pushes them back and breaks the loop.\n\nHmm. Now I have to translate this into Fortran. Let's break down each part.\n\nFirst, the main structure. The Java program reads input from stdin, processes it, then outputs. The key parts are the TaskB class's solve method, which handles the logic with the stack.\n\nFortran doesn't have classes like Java, so everything needs to be in a subroutine or function. Let's think about how to structure it. The main program will read the input, call a function or subroutine to solve the problem, then output the result.\n\nThe InputReader class in Java reads tokens. Since in Fortran, I/O is a bit more straightforward, perhaps just read a string from standard input directly. But need to make sure that the string is read correctly, ignoring any whitespace? Wait, looking at the InputReader's next() method in Java: it splits on whitespace, but the problem likely requires reading a single line as a string. Let me check. The problem for ABC120 C is probably about a single string input\u2014like, the input is just one line with the string. Because in the Java code, the first input is read as x=in.next() which would be the next token. Wait, but if the input is just the string, maybe in.next() just reads the entire input. But perhaps in some cases, the problem requires reading the entire line? Wait, the original problem for ABC120 C is \"2 Socgrams\". Let me recall. Oh right, the problem is called \"Two Switches\". The task is, given a string S, find the maximum possible value of f(i,j) = number of indices k where S_k is different between the two substrings. Or maybe I needn't care about the problem details but the code's logic. Anyway, according to the code, the input is read via in.next() which first time would get the next token, but if the input is just a single line, in.next() would read the whole string. Wait actually, no. For example, the next() function returns the next token, and the initial tokenizer is created from the line. So if the input is a single line like \"01001\", then next() would return the entire string as that line has one token. But if there were multiple tokens (like if the problem required multiple inputs per line?), but according to the code's usage here, x is assigned to in.next(), implying that the input is a single string.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to read the entire input, perhaps just read a single string from stdin. Let me see: in Fortran, to read a string, maybe using \"read(*,'(a)') x\" which reads the entire line (up to the newline) into x. That might do it.\n\nNext, the logic:\n\nThe key is the stack handling. The stack is of characters (in Java, Character). In Fortran, since arrays are fixed size, perhaps use an array to simulate a stack. Alternatively, use a dynamically resizable array through arrays but with some management. However, to be efficient, maybe preallocate a large enough array. Let me think: the maximum possible length of x is probably up to like 1e5 or something, but for a code submission, it's manageable. Let's assume that.\n\nIn Fortran, the stack can be implemented as an array of characters, with an index indicating the top. Let's say:\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=1), DIMENSION(:), ALLOCATABLE :: stack\ninteger :: top = 0\n\nThen pushing is appending, incrementing the top. Popping is reading the top element, decrementing top.\n\nNow the code's main loop is:\n\nFor each character in x:\n\n   Push to stack.\n\n   Then, while the stack size is >1:\n\n       pop p and q (the last two elements)\n\n       check if p and q are 0 and 1 or vice versa.\n\n       if yes, increment c by 1, continue (so don't push them back, next loop iteration checks again)\n\n       else, push them back (push q first then p?), wait in Java:\n\nWait the Java code says:\n\nIn the loop:\n\ns.push(q) then s.push(p). Wait because when we pop, the first pop is p (the top of the stack before the pops), then q is the next pop.\n\nWait in Java:\n\nInitially, the stack had the two elements: q (underneath) and p (on top). Then they are popped in order p then q? Wait no. The first pop is the topmost element, so the first pop gives the last character pushed. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the stack has elements [ ... a, b], then the first pop() is b, and the second is a? Wait no, stack order: when you pop first, the top is first popped. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose, the stack at some step contains elements bottom -> ... -> 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' (top is 'd'). When the code does p = s.pop(), p becomes d, then q = s.pop() is c. So, after popping, the stack is now up to b. So when they test p and q (d and c?), or wait here in the problem's case, maybe when we have two elements, p is the top, q the one below.\n\nWait, in the problem's code logic, for a pair of elements that are 0 and 1 (reverse of each other), when found, they are popped (removed from stack, increment count). But if they are not such a pair, put back and stop checking further.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nfor each new character pushed (so top increases by one):\n\n   enter loop:\n\n      pop p (current top), then pop q (now top is previous-1). Check if they are opposite.\n\n      if yes:\n\n          c +=1,\n\n          continue (so go to next iteration of while loop, to check again with the new top?)\n\n      else:\n\n          push q and p again,\n\n          break out of while loop.\n\nWait in the Java code, the while loop (while stack size >1) will loop again. Let's think through an example:\n\nSuppose the stack has a, b, c (a is bottom, c top). Then, adding another, d.\n\nAfter pushing d:\n\nstack size is 4. Then enter the while:\n\npop() gives d, then pop again gives c. Compare (d and c). Not a pair, then push back c, d.\n\nThe stack is back to a, b, c, d again. Break the while loop and continue the for loop.\n\nSo each time after a push, we check the top two, and repeat checking as long as we can make a pair each time.\n\nEach time a pair is found, we remove those two, and continue checking the new top.\n\nSo, it's like whenever a pair is found, they are both removed, and then since the stack may now have another pair on top again, we can check again.\n\nThe count c counts how many such pair removals occurred, each counts as a pair (so multiplicative factor of 2 at the end).\n\nIn terms of Fortran code:\n\nThe stack can be implemented as:\n\nPerhaps we can use a character array with a top pointer.\n\nInitialize stack dimension, say, to 1e5 (or resize as needed, but perhaps we can preallocate enough).\n\nLet's see:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC120_C\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=100000) :: x  ! assuming input length is up to 1e5\n    integer :: i, c, top, nchars\n    character(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: stack\n    character(len=1) :: p, q\n\n    read(*, '(a)', advance='no') x ! read the entire input line into x until end\n\n    ! Trim the string to remove trailing spaces? Or not, assuming the problem reads until EOL.\n    ! But in any case, nchars is the length of x.\n\n    nchars = len_trim(x)\n\n    allocate (stack(nchars))  ! worst case stack can be size nchars (but probably less)\n    top = 0\n    c = 0\n\n    do i = 1, nchars\n        ! push the character to stack\n        top = top + 1\n        stack(top) = x(i:i)\n\n        ! while loop to check for possible pairs\n        do while (top > 1)\n            ! pop the last two elements\n            p = stack(top)\n            top = top -1\n            q = stack(top)\n            top = top -1\n\n            ! check if they are 1-0 or 0-1\n            if ( (p == \"0\" .and. q == \"1\") .or. (p == \"1\" .and. q == \"0\") ) then\n                c = c + 1\n                ! since they have been popped and counted, don't push them back. Continue the loop \n                ! to check again (the do-while continues)\n            else\n                ! revert the pops: push back q then p (since stack grows from 1 upwards? Wait after popping q and p, push back q first, then p?\n                ! yes, because after the two pops, the stack is now top = original top-2. So, need to push q then p to put them back in reverse?\n\n                ! Push back q first, then p. So top increases first by 1, put q there, then again increment and put p.\n\n                top = top +1\n                stack(top) = q\n\n                top = top +1\n                stack(top) = p\n\n                exit   ! break the do while loop (go back to 'do while')\n            endif\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    print*, c *2\n\nend program atcoder_ABC120_C\n\nWait, but let's check the logic step by step.\n\nIn the Java code, inside the while (stack.size()>1) loop:\n\nThey popped p (top), then popped q (now one less).\n\nIf they form a pair, then continue the loop (so next time the while condition is checked again: top is now (previous top -2). If there's more elements, the loop will continue.\n\nIf they are not a pair, then push back q and p (in order?), then break.\n\nWait, in Java, when pushing back, they do s.push(q), s.push(p). \n\nSo the original stack before popping was [ ... , q, p ]\n\nAfter popping both, and then pushing back q and p again, so the stack is brought back to the previous state (q, p are restored on top).\n\nWait, the first pop was p (the top element). Then q was the next pop (the one below p). \n\nThen pushing q into the empty space (top = top-2) pushes first q, then p? \n\nWait in the Java code: \n\nAfter the pops, in the \"else\" branch:\n\ns.push(q) and s.push(p). So the first element to be pushed is q, then p. So the stack after this becomes previous state before popping, because the popped elements are q and p, and pushing them back in that order? Let's see:\n\nOriginal stack order before popping: bottom, ..., a, ..., q, p (top is p). \n\nThe first pop gets p, stack becomes bottom ...a ... q (top at q's level). The second pop gets q, so stack becomes ...a (the top now is a-... or until q's previous one). \n\nAfter popping both, stack is as below. So pushing back q first (stack becomes ...a and q, with top being q), then pushing p makes the stack ...a q p (the original state again).\n\nYes, exactly restoring the previous stack state. \n\nThus in Fortran, after popping q and p (with the stack now at top-2), and pushing back the q then p. \n\nSo in the code above, when they are not a pair, we push back first q, then p to get the stack back to the original minus the popped two, except no\u2014we need to return to the original state before the two pops. Wait, because after those two pops, the top was decreased by two. \n\nWhen we push back q then p:\n\nAfter the first push of q: top becomes (top +1) (which was previously (old_top -2)). \n\nWait in the Fortran code:\n\nAfter the pops, top was set to the previous value minus 2. For example, if the original top before the two pops was N, then after first pop, top=N-1, then after second pop, top becomes N-2.\n\nThen, after the 'else' clause:\n\nWe do top = top +1 (now N-2+1 = N-1) and set stack(N-1) to q,\n\nthen top = N (N-1+1) and set stack(N) to p.\n\nThus, stack(N-1 to N) are q and p, so the stack now has all the elements up to N, same as before. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nThe loop will then check again the condition (top>1). \n\nWait, when they are not a pair, the do while loop executes the exit, so breaks out of the inner do loop.\n\nWait in the code here, the Fortran code uses a do while (top>1) and continues until that condition is met.\n\nWait in Fortran, the syntax for a do-while loop is a bit different. Hmm, actually Fortran doesn't have a standard do-while loop like C or Java. The 'do ... end do' repeats normally, but to make it do-while-like, the condition must be at the end, using \"exit\" or \"cycle\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a do loop with a condition at the top that might break early.\n\nHmm, so in the code above, the 'do while (top >1)' is written as:\n\ndo while (top >1)\n\nthen the operations, with an exit in the else clause?\n\nWait in the code above:\n\nThe inner loop is:\n\ndo while (top >1)\n\nInside:\n\np = stack(top); top -=1\n\nq = stack(top); top -=1? \n\nWait no, in the code written above, the user has:\n\nWait in the code I thought of:\n\nThe loop body is:\n\ndo while (top >1)\n... \nend do\n\nWait the loop runs as long as the condition (after the loop is entered). Wait, no, Fortran's do while can only be emulated by either:\n\nA regular loop with an exit at the end (to act as a while loop), or using a condition at the beginning.\n\nSo perhaps the code must be structured as:\n\ninner_loop: do\n    if (top <=1 ) exit inner_loop\n    ! process here\n    ... \n    if (they form a pair) continue inner_loop\n    else exit inner_loop\nend do inner_loop\n\nWait this is getting complicated. Let me re-express the logic of the inner while loop in Java.\n\nThe Java code has:\n\nwhile (stack.size() > 1 ) { \n\nprocess the top two elements:\n\nthen if they are not a pair, you break from the loop (break).\n\nelse: you continue (continue)\n\nSo, the next iteration of the loop (if the stack size is still >1) will continue.\n\nSo in the Java loop, if a pair is found (the if clause), then they are popped and the 'continue' will loop back to condition.\n\nThe loop will keep checking until a point where a pair is not found, then the 'else' exits the while loop.\n\nWait, no in the Java code:\n\nWait in the code:\n\nAfter popping p and q, then if they form a pair (then):\n\n- c is increased, and 'continue' is executed. The continue statement causes the loop to recheck the condition (stack.size()>1) again, thereby continuing the loop.\n\nBut the stack has now been popped twice, so size is reduced by 2 (since the p and q were not added back, so the stack.top is now (previous top -2).\n\nTherefore, the loop continues to check again, possibly now having a new top which allows another pair check.\n\nIn the else block:\n\nthe 's.push(q); s.push p();' pushes them back so that the stack top is back to the previous state except before popping. So the 'break' exits the loop (the while loop won't execute again because after that, the loop condition is checked again (only if the continue isn't hit. So after the 'break', the while loop is exited.\n\nTherefore in the Java's loop, each iteration is:\n\n- check whether the stack has at least two elements.\n\n- If yes, then run the code inside.\n\nSo the equivalent in Fortran would be to use a loop that runs as long as the top >1, but how to do the 'continue'?\n\nHmm perhaps this structure:\n\n do\n\n   if (top <= 1) exit\n\n   ! process:\n\n   p = stack(top); top = top -1\n\n   q = stack(top); top = top -1 \n\n   if ( p '1-0 or 0-1' ) then\n\n       c +=1 \n\n       continue (proceed back to check top again, since we have removed two elements; stack top is now top = previous -2. But in the next iteration, the loop will start over and check top >1. This is the equivalent of continuing.\n\n   else \n\n       ! push back q and p, then break:\n\n       top = top +1; stack(top) = q \n\n       top = top +1; stack(top) = p \n\n       exit \n\n   end if \n\n end do \n\nWait that is a do-until loop where the loop continues as long as after processing, the continue is taken again.\n\nWait the code:\n\nThe inner loop is:\n\n inner_loop: do\n\n    if (top <=1) exit inner_loop\n\n    p = stack(top)\n\n    top = top -1\n\n    q = stack(top)\n\n    top = top -1\n\n    if ( pair ) then \n\n        c +=1\n\n        cycle inner_loop   ! to continue loop, and check again \n\n    else \n\n        ! push back \n\n        top = top +1\n\n        stack(top) = q\n\n        top = top +1 \n\n        stack(top) = p \n\n        exit inner_loop    ! breaks out \n\n    end if \n\nend do inner_loop \n\nWait, but when a pair is found, after popping, the current stack size is (previous top -2). \n\nThe code then cycles (continues) back to start of the loop, which will then exit if the new top is less than or equal to 1?\n\nWait let me think: after processing:\n\nSuppose a pair is found, so they are popped (top reduces by 2). We cycle the loop. The next iteration starts by checking if (top <=1), so if now top could be bigger than 1 (like, after popping two elements, but remaining stack has more than one element), then it will again process.\n\nSo the loop correctly continues until there are no more pairs to process, or until the stack has fewer than two elements. This should replicate the Java's loop's behavior.\n\nYes, so the inner loop in Fortran would use a labeled loop (here, 'inner_loop'), and use cycle and exit appropriately.\n\nNow, the problem is to write the code accordingly.\n\nAdditionally:\n\nThe way of accessing characters in Fortran strings is a bit different. The input x is read via read, and each character can be accessed like x(i:i), for position i. So that seems right.\n\nNow, let me think of possible issues.\n\nFirst, variable declarations:\n\nVariables:\n\n- c (number of valid pairs) is initialized to 0.\n\n- top starts at 0, and is incremented when we push.\n\nThe stack array is allocated to nchars (the length of the string), but the size required could be up to the characters in the string, which is okay.\n\nBut in the problem's code, the stack can't be larger than the input length. Since the code pushes each character and may remove some, the maximum stack size can't exceed the input length, so it's okay to preallocate to nchars.\n\nNow for code syntax:\n\nIn Fortran, character comparisons are done with the .eq. or '==', but perhaps using == is okay in modern fortran? I think both are acceptable, but perhaps need quotes around the characters. Like:\n\nif( ( ( p == '0' ) .and. ( q == '1' )) .or. ( p == '1' .and. q == '0' ) ) then \n\nYes.\n\nNow, let me write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input string. We can use:\n\nread (*, '(a)') x\n\nBut need to make sure that we are able to read the entire line. Since Fortran's read might stop at first whitespace, unless the format is adjusted. Alternatively, use:\n\nread(*, '(a)', advance='no') x\n\nWait not sure if the 'advance' is needed here. Or use some other method. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nread(*,'(a100000)') x\n\nto read up to 1e5 characters. Since the maximum input length is not known, but let's assume 1e5 is enough, the problem allows that.\n\nAlternatively, the best way might be to read a line:\n\n  character(len=100000) : x\n\n  read (*,'(a)',advance='no') x\n\nBut perhaps the 'trim' is needed when getting the actual length.\n\nBut in the code, the input is read into x, and the nchars is the length of the trimmed string (so with trailing blanks if any removed). So nchars = len_trim(x)\n\nNow, the stack array is allocatable, so:\n\nallocate( stack(nchars) )\n\nOnce allocated, the loop proceeds.\n\nImplementing the loop with the inner labeled loop as above.\n\nTesting this logic.\n\nSample input and testing:\n\nLet's take an example from the problem. Suppose the input is \"01\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst push '0', stack is [0]. Then after pushing, the inner loop runs? \n\nLoop checks top>1 (0+1=1? Wait after pushing:\n\nfor i=1 (first character):\n\npush 0, so top becomes 1.\n\nThen, inner loop starts:\n\nTest top (now 1) >1? No. So inner loop doesn't run.\n\nNext character is '1' (i=2):\n\npush, stack now has [0,1], top is 2.\n\nenter inner loop:\n\nCheck top>1 (2>1 is true). proceed.\n\np is stack(2) = '1', then top becomes 1. \n\nq is stack(1) = '0', then top becomes 0 (since top=1-1=0).\n\nCheck if '1' and '0' forms a pair, yes.\n\nso c becomes 1. \n\nNow, since in this case, after the pair, the stack size after popping becomes 0; but the continue statement will cycle back to the loop.\n\nWait wait:\n\nWait after popping:\n\ntop after popping the two was 2 \u2192 p = '1', then top becomes 1. second pop q = stack(1) \u2192 '0', top now 0.\n\nSince it's a match, the \"then\" clause increases c to 1, and then cycle inner_loop.\n\nSo the loop repeats (since the cycle regains control at the start of the loop).\n\nNow, in the next iteration of inner_loop:\n\ncheck top (0) >1? No. So the loop exits.\n\nThus, the inner loop finishes with c=1. Then proceed to the next loop iteration (the character loop).\n\nAfter that, the total c is 1, and multiplied by 2 gives 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: input \"1001\".\n\nBreaking it down step by step:\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe string is '1','0','0','1'.\n\nInitially stack is empty.\n\nFirst, push '1' \u2192 stack [1], top=1. No inner loop.\n\nThen second character '0' pushed, top 2.\n\nenter inner loop: top is 2>1.\n\npop p='0', then q='1', check (p is '0', q '1'): yes.\n\nc becomes 1.\n\ncontinue the cycle. Now, after this, the stack is now top was 0 (after popping two elements, since top was 2, popped twice becomes 0).\n\nNext iteration of inner loop: check top (0) \u22641 \u2192 exit.\n\nThus we leave inner loop.\n\nProceed to third character '0' \u2192 pushed to stack (top becomes 1 with \"0\").\n\nThen, after pushing, top is now 2 (since after previous(stack was size 0) adding '0' \u2192 top 1. Then the third character is pushed as the third (wait, the third is the third character: let me clarify.\n\nWait after first character '1' pushed \u2192 top is 1.\n\nAfter second character '0', pushed (top=2). Inner loop reduces to 0.\n\nThird character is '0', being third step:\n\ni=3, pushing: top becomes 1 (from 0+1). Then, top is now 1 \u2192 no inner loop.\n\nFourth character '1':\n\npush \u2192 top becomes 2. run the inner loop.\n\nNow, stack has '0' (position1), '1' (top=2).\n\nIn inner loop, top is 2>1.\n\npop p = '1', q is '0 \u2192 check: they are a pair. So c increases to 1+1=2.\n\ncycle the loop. After popping, top is 0 again. Next iteration top 0 \u2192 exit.\n\nThus total c is 2 \u2192 output 4. Let's check.\n\nThe string \"1001\" would have pairs:\n\nThe pairs are between the first 1 and 0, and between the last 0 and 1? \n\nBut in the code's count, each matching pair pair adds 1 to c.\n\nSo first pair (1 and0) \u2192 count becomes 1, then after adding the last '1' and 0 \u2192 forming another pair (0 and1 \u2192 yes, count becomes 2. Hence total output 4.\n\nThe actual pairs, perhaps in pairs: first the 1 and0 are removed, then the 0 and1 (from the final ones). Thus total 4 prints.\n\nThus the code works for this case.\n\nAnother test case: \"0001\".\n\nx is \"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"1\".\n\nProcessing step by step:\n\nAfter each character:\n\nAfter pushing first '0', top 1 \u2192 can't proceed.\n\nSecond '0': pushed to top2 \u2192 check pair.\n\np=0, q=0 \u2192 not. push back \u2192 breaks. So c is 0.\n\nThird '0': pushed to top 3 \u2192 then check stack size 3.\n\nThe inner loop:\n\ntop>1 \u2192 process:\n\np=0 (stack(3)), q=0 (stack(2)), check \u2192 not pair \u2192 push back, so top is back to 3 \u2192 exit loop.\n\nThen fourth character '1' \u2192 pushed, top 4.\n\nLoop enters with top 4>1:\n\npop p=1, q=0 \u2192 '0' (stack(3) was 0, but after pops, stack is:\n\nFirst pop of 1 (top4), q is stack3 (0) \u2192 then the two are 1 and 0.\n\nWait let me track:\n\nFourth character is '1', pushed to top4.\n\nNow in inner loop:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\np=1 (stack4), pop \u2192 top becomes 3.\n\nq = stack3 \u2192 which was 0.\n\nSo 1 and 0 \u2192 pair. So c increases by 1 (to 1). \n\nAfter popping, top is 3-1 (after two pops \u2192 was at top2.\n\nBecause after popping p (1), top was 3. popping q (stack3) now top becomes 2 (stack3 was the third element, but after removing two: \n\nOriginal top was 4 \u2192 after popping first time (p=1) \u2192 top=3, then second pop (q = stack3 (0) \u2192 then top becomes 2.\n\nNow, stack is:\n\nelements 1: 0 (first three characters made it: first three 0s, but stack after first two steps (when added 0,0,0,1):\n\nAfter processing first three 0s:\n\nAfter pushing third '0' (third character), stack is [0,0,0]. Then inner loop:\n\nwhen pushing third '0', inner loop processes stack size 3. So:\n\np0 =0 (third element), q0 is second 0. since they are same \u2192 no pairing. thus after pushback, top is back to 3. \n\nWhen fourth character is pushed \u2192 becomes [0001]\n\nthen the first loop in inner processing pops first pair (the last 0 and the 1). The '1' and '0' (q) form a pair \u2192 c=1. \n\nSince they form a pair, they are removed, leading to stack size now being 2 (the top after pops was 2 (top after two pops: initial size was 4, popped two steps \u2192 top becomes 4-2=2.\n\nWait after popping 1 and 0:\n\nThe initial stack is [0,0,0,1]. So the first pop is 1 (top=4 \u2192 now 3, then q is stack3 which is 0 (third element). \n\nSo stack after pops becomes [0,0]. Then the code increments c to 1 and then the cycle restarts the loop:\n\nin the inner loop's cycle, loop continues:\n\nNow the top is 2 (from 4 - 2 pops). \n\nWe check again the top. \n\n2>1 \u2192 proceed again. \n\nNow, next iteration of inner loop:\n\np is stack(2) \u2192 '0', then q is stack(1) \u2192 '0'. \n\nThese do not form a pair \u2192 so push back \u2192 top becomes 2 again. Exit loop.\n\nThus total c is 1 \u2192 output 2. \n\nWhich makes sense because the pair was between the 0 and the 1 at the end. The other 0's do not form a pair among themselves.\n\nThus the code works.\n\nNow, handling the code's variables:\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Fortran, array indices start at 1. The stack is dimensioned from 1 to nchars (since allocated as stack(nchars)), but in the code above, the initial top =0. \n\nWait, the stack array allocation is to nchars, so the indices go from 1 up. So pushing starts at 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the final code in Fortran would look like:\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC120_C\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: max_len = 100000\n    character(len=max_len) :: x\n    integer :: i, c, top, nchars\n    character(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: stack\n    character(len=1) :: pt, qt  ! renamed variables to prevent conflicts with F90 keywords like 'p' could conflict?\n\n    read(*, '(a)') x\n    nchars = len_trim(x)\n    allocate(stack(nchars))\n    top = 0\n    c = 0\n\n    do i = 1, nchars\n        top = top + 1\n        stack(top) = x(i:i)\n\n        inner_loop: do\n            if (top <= 1) exit inner_loop\n            pt = stack(top)\n            top = top -1\n            qt = stack(top)\n            top = top -1\n\n            if ( (pt == '0' .and. qt == '1') .or. (pt == '1' .and. qt == '0') ) then\n                c = c +1\n                ! continue the loop since stack may now have more elements\n                cycle inner_loop\n            else\n                ! push back qt and pt\n                top = top +1\n                stack(top) = qt\n                top = top +1\n                stack(top) = pt\n                exit inner_loop\n            end if\n        end do inner_loop\n    end do\n\n    print*, c *2\n    deallocate(stack)\n\nend program atcoder_ABC120_C\n\nWait, I had to avoid using 'p' as a variable since in some cases, Fortran may not like variable names that could clash with Fortran internal functions, so used 'pt' and 'qt'.\n\nTesting this code step by step.\n\nAnother possible issue is variable names: 'q' is a function in Fortran? Not that I remember, but 'p' and 'q' should be okay, but to be safe, maybe named pt and qt.\n\nAlternatively, the original names can be used. Let me check. \n\nIn Fortran, some keywords are IF, DO, ELSE, etc., but as long as variable names aren't those, it's okay. \n\nSo perhaps just p and q work.\n\nAlternatively, to be safer, variables like c and top must not be keywords. 'Top' is okay.\n\nAssuming the variable names are fine, perhaps:\n\nRewriting with variable names p and q:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC120_C\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: max_len = 100000\n    character(len=max_len) :: x\n    integer :: i, c, top =0, nchars\n    character(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: stack\n    character(len=1) :: p, q \n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*, '(a)', advance='no') x\n    nchars = len_trim(x)\n\n    allocate( stack(nchars) )\n\n    c =0 \n\n    do i =1, nchars\n\n        top = top +1\n        stack(top) = x(i:i)\n\n        inner_loop: do\n            if (top <=1) exit inner_loop \n\n            p = stack(top)\n            top = top -1\n            q = stack(top)\n            top = top -1 \n\n            if ( (p == '0' .and. q == '1') .or. (p == '1' .and. q == '0') ) then\n                c = c +1 \n                cycle inner_loop \n            else \n                ! Push back q and p \n                top = top +1\n                stack(top) = q\n                top = top +1\n                stack(top) = p \n\n                exit inner_loop\n            endif \n        end do inner_loop \n\n    end do \n\n    print*, c *2 \n\n    deallocate(stack)\nend program atcoder_ABC120_C \n\nWait but in the else block, when pushing back, the first popped is p (top of stack), then q was the previous. \n\nWhen we push back, first push q (because after popping p (top) first, then q. So the order should be: push q back first (to previous's current top's below), then push p on top of it. \n\nWait according to the steps:\n\nAfter pops, the top had been:\n\nInitial top before pops was say T. \n\nPopping p: \n\np = stack(T) \n\ntop becomes T-1 \n\nthen q = stack(T-1)\n\ntop becomes T-2 \n\nSo now, the current top is T-2 \n\nSo after the pops, the stack is now T-2 \n\nWhen pushing back, first set top = T-2 +1 = T-1. \n\nstack(T-1) = q \u2192 next top becomes T-1. \n\nThen top becomes T (T-1 +1 = T), set stack(T) = P \u2192 \n\nso the stack now has q at T-1 and p at T.\n\n Thus, the order is correct. \n\nTherefore the code should be correct.\n\nNow, last thing: when reading the input. In Fortran, when you read a string with read(*, '(a)') x, it reads until end of record (which is end of line in most cases unless the input is unformatted). \n\nHowever, to make sure that trailing spaces are not included, it's better to use len_trim. \n\nI think this should handle it.\n\nAnother point: the input may be too long for the max_len of 1e5. Well, considering the problem constraints, that's acceptable as per problem's expectation.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work as required."
