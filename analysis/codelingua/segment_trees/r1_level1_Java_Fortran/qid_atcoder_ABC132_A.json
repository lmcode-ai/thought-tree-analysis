    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at what the Java code does first.\n\nThe Java code reads a string from the input, then checks if exactly two different characters each appear exactly twice. If so, it prints \"Yes\", otherwise \"No\".\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read a string.\n2. Count the frequency of each character.\n3. Check if there are exactly two distinct characters, and each occurs exactly twice.\n4. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on that check.\n\nFortran doesn't have built-in hash maps, so I need to find another way to count the characters. Since the input string is 4 characters long (since the problem is from ABC132 A, which I recall expects 4 characters), perhaps we can handle it without a hash map.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the input is a string of exactly four characters. Because in the problem statement (ABC132 A), the input is a string S of length 4. So the code is checking if two different characters each appear exactly twice. Like, \"AABB\" would be yes, \"ABAB\", \"ABBA\", etc., but \"AAAA\" would be no (since only one character), and \"AABC\" would be no (since one appears once).\n\nSo given that the input is four characters, perhaps the Fortran code can exploit that. Let's think: the string has four characters. We can sort them and check the conditions.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSort the characters, then check the first two are the same and the next two are the same, and the first two are different from the next two. Or other possibilities where two pairs exist.\n\nAlternatively, count how many distinct characters there are and their counts.\n\nBut how to count the distinct characters and their counts in Fortran.\n\nSince the string is 4 characters, maybe it's feasible to compare each character with others.\n\nWait, here's an alternative plan. Let's create a list of the counts for each distinct character. For example, in the case of \"AABB\", the counts are 2 and 2. So the code can check if the list of counts is exactly two counts of 2.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the 4-character string.\n\n2. Create an array to hold the counts. But since the maximum possible distinct characters is 4, but we need to group duplicates.\n\nOne way is to sort the characters. Then group them. For example, after sorting, check if the first two are the same and the last two are the same, but different from the first two. That would cover cases like \"AABB\", \"ABAB\" (sorted would be \"AABB\" if ABAB is A, A, B, B). Wait, \"ABAB\" when sorted becomes AABB. So sorted order would be AABB.\n\nWait, if the string is \"ABAB\", sorting gives 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B'. So in the sorted array, the first two are same, next two same. So in this case, the counts are 2 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the string is \"AABC\", sorted is \"AABC\", then the counts would be 2,1,1. So the code can check if after sorting, the counts are exactly two 2's.\n\nSo for the sorted array, possible scenarios:\n\n- All four characters same: counts [4] \u2192 invalid.\n\n- Two pairs: counts [2,2] \u2192 valid.\n\n- One triplet and one single: [3,1] \u2192 invalid.\n\n- One pair and two singles: [2,1,1] \u2192 invalid.\n\n- All four different: [1,1,1,1] \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the key is to check that there are exactly two groups, each of size two.\n\nSo in Fortran, how to do that.\n\nApproach:\n\n1. Read the input string, check its length is 4 (though in the problem statement, it's given as 4, but perhaps the code should enforce that? Probably not necessary for the problem.)\n\n2. Convert the string into a sorted array of characters.\n\n3. Check if the first two characters are equal, the next two are equal, and the first pair is different from the second pair. Or another scenario where the first three are the same (but that's not possible for two pairs). Wait, perhaps after sorting, the two pairs will be consecutive.\n\nSo sorted string should be in the form of aabb, abab (but sorted would be aabb), abba (sorted aabb), etc.\n\nSo the sorted string must be of the form XXYY where X and Y are distinct characters.\n\nSo check:\n\nsorted(1) == sorted(2) and sorted(3) == sorted(4), and sorted(2) != sorted(3).\n\nOR:\n\nanother possibility: check that the first two are same and the next two are same, and the middle two are different.\n\nSo after sorting, the four characters are arranged as a a b b.\n\nSo if after sorting:\n\ncharacters(1) == characters(2) and characters(3) == characters(4), and characters(2) != characters(3).\n\nThen output yes.\n\nElse, no.\n\nThis approach avoids the need for hash maps and is straightforward in Fortran.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the input string, make sure it's 4 characters. Then create a sorted version.\n\nBut how to sort the characters in Fortran.\n\nFortran can manipulate strings as arrays of characters.\n\nSo let's proceed:\n\nprogram abc132a\n    implicit none\n    character(4) :: s\n    character(4) :: sorted\n    integer :: i, j\n    character :: temp\n\n    read(*,*) s\n\n    ! Convert to an array to sort\n    sorted = s\n    ! Bubble sort for simplicity (since 4 elements)\n    do i = 1, 3\n        do j = 1, 4 - i\n            if (sorted(j:j) > sorted(j+1:j+1)) then\n                temp = sorted(j:j)\n                sorted(j:j) = sorted(j+1:j+1)\n                sorted(j+1:j+1) = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    ! Check conditions\n    if (sorted(1:1) == sorted(2:2) .and. sorted(3:3) == sorted(4:4) .and. sorted(2:2) /= sorted(3:3)) then\n        print *, 'Yes'\n    else\n        print *, 'No'\n    end if\nend program abc132a\n\nWait, but in the sorted array, the first two are same, the next two are same, and the two pairs are different. So the condition is:\n\nsorted(1) == sorted(2) and sorted(3) == sorted(4) and sorted(2) /= sorted(3).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code would handle all cases where the input has two pairs.\n\nTesting with \"AABB\" \u2192 sorted is AABB \u2192 condition is met.\n\nTest \"ABAB\" \u2192 sorted is AABB \u2192 condition met.\n\nTest \"ABBA\" \u2192 sorted is AABB \u2192 condition met.\n\nTest \"AAAA\" \u2192 sorted is AAAA \u2192 sorted(1) == sorted(2) and sorted(3) == sorted(4), but sorted(2) equals sorted(3) \u2192 condition fails.\n\nTest \"AAAB\" \u2192 sorted is AAAB \u2192 after sorting, first three are A. So sorted(1)=A, sorted(2)=A, sorted(3)=A, sorted(4)=B. Then sorted(3) != sorted(4). So in the check, sorted(1) == sorted(2) is true, sorted(3) == sorted(4) \u2192 A == B? No. So condition fails.\n\nTest \"AABC\" \u2192 sorted is AABC \u2192 sorted(1) and (2) are A, but (3) and (4) are B and C. So sorted(3) != sorted(4). So condition fails.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code can be written this way, which is more efficient and doesn't need hash maps, given the problem's constraints.\n\nThis code should correctly translate the original Java code's logic."
