So when checking the neighbor's position, after adding dy and dx, need to check if ny is >=1 and <= H, nx >=1 and <= W.\n\nSo the dx and dy arrays in Java are {1, -1, 0, 0} and {0, 0, 1, -1}. So the four directions are down, up, right, left. But in 1-based, moving in dx and dy terms:\n\ndx would be the change in x (column), dy the change in y (row). So the four directions would be: For example, (dy=1, dx=0) means next row (down), (dy=-1, dx=0) means previous row (up), (dx=1, dy=0) next column (right), etc. Wait, in Java code:\n\ndx array is {1, -1, 0, 0} for x directions.

But in Java's code, the matrix is H rows and W columns. So moving down increases the row index (since y is the row index). So dy=1 would be moving down a row. But in Fortran, which uses 1-based indices, the same logic applies. So the directions are:\n\ndx would be [1, -1, 0, 0], dy [0, 0, 1, -1], but in Fortran, the indices are 1-based.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing.\n\nThe Java program reads H and W as input dimensions. Then it reads H rows of characters into a 2D array A. It initializes a queue with all the positions of '#' characters. Each queue element is an array of three integers: y, x, and depth (starting at 0). The flag array keeps track of visited cells. The BFS algorithm then processes each element in the queue, checking the four neighboring cells. If a neighboring cell is unvisited and is '.', it's added to the queue with depth+1. The maximum depth encountered is the answer, which is printed.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have a built-in queue data structure. So I'll need to simulate the queue using arrays and manage front and rear pointers. Alternatively, since the BFS is level-order, maybe using a list or dynamic arrays. But for efficiency, perhaps a pair of arrays: the current level and next level.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the queue is processed using a loop, removing elements from the front. So in Fortran, perhaps using a queue implemented with a dynamic array where we track the front and deque elements. But since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays, maybe using a large enough array and indices to track the start and end of the queue.\n\nAlternatively, using a list structure with allocatable arrays. But maybe for simplicity, a fixed-size array that's big enough. The maximum possible elements in the queue would be H*W, which could be up to, say, 1e6 if H and W are 1e3 each. But in practice, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read H and W.\n2. Read H lines of input into a 2D array A.\n3. Initialize the queue with all the positions where A has '#', with depth 0.\n4. Initialize a visited array (flag) to keep track of visited cells.\n5. For BFS, process each element in the queue, checking all four directions.\n6. For each valid neighbor, if not visited and is '.', mark as visited, add to queue with depth+1, update the answer.\n\nNow, in Fortran:\n\n- Use a 2D character array for A.\n- The queue can be represented as three separate arrays (y, x, depth), or a single array of a derived type. But derived types might complicate things. Alternatively, using three 1D arrays, or a 2D array where each row is (y, x, depth). But handling dynamic queues in Fortran is a bit tricky.\n\nLet me think. The Java code uses a queue that is processed in FIFO order. So, perhaps using a list where elements are added to the end and removed from the front. But in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be manipulated, but removing elements from the front is O(n) time. However, for the problem constraints, if H and W are up to 1e3, then H*W is up to 1e6. So if each BFS step processes each cell once, this should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a circular buffer approach with head and tail pointers. Let's see. Let's use a queue structure with three arrays: y_queue, x_queue, depth_queue. The head and tail indices track the current elements. Initially, head is 1 and tail is 0. When adding elements, tail increases, and when removing, head increases. But this requires a fixed maximum size. If the maximum possible elements in the queue is H*W, then we can preallocate arrays of size H*W.\n\nSo steps for queue:\n\n- Initialize queue arrays with size H*W.\n- When enqueueing, increment the tail and store the values.\n- When dequeueing, increment the head and take the values.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead H, W.\n\nAllocate A as a character array of H rows and W columns.\n\nInitialize the queue. For each cell in A that is '#', enqueue it with depth 0.\n\nInitialize the flag array (H x W) to 0. Mark the initial positions as visited (since in the Java code, when the cell is '#', the code adds it to the queue and when processing, those cells' neighbors are checked. Wait, in the Java code, the initial '#' cells are added, but their positions are not marked in the flag array. Wait, looking at the Java code:\n\nThe flag array is initialized to 0. When a cell is processed (removed from the queue), for each neighbor, if flag is 0 and A is '.', then mark flag as 1 and add to queue. So the initial '#' cells are not marked in the flag array. Wait, no. Because when processing the initial cells (the '#') in the queue, their neighbors are checked. For example, when processing a cell (y,x), the code checks the four directions. The code checks if the neighbor is within bounds, and if flag is 0 and A is '.', then it's added. The initial '#' cells are in the queue, but their own positions are not marked as visited. However, during BFS, when a cell is dequeued, the code checks neighbors. But the initial '#' cells may have their own positions' flag as 0. However, since their A is '#', when their neighbors are processed, the code checks A[y+dy][x+dx] == '.', so the '#' cells are not added again. So the flag array is only used for '.' cells that have been visited. So the initial '#' cells' positions in the flag array remain 0, but they are not processed again because their A is '#'.\n\nSo in Fortran, the flag array should be initialized to 0. Then, when processing a cell (y,x), for each direction, check if the neighbor is within bounds, if flag is 0 and A is '.', then set flag to 1 and add to the queue.\n\nSo the flag array tracks visited '.' cells.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the code structure:\n\nRead H and W.\n\nRead H lines, each line is a string. Convert each character into the A array.\n\nInitialize the queue. For each cell (i,j), if A(i,j) is '#', add (i,j,0) to the queue.\n\nInitialize flag as a 2D array of HxW, initialized to 0.\n\ndx and dy arrays are [1, -1, 0, 0] and [0, 0, 1, -1], respectively.\n\nInitialize ans to 0.\n\nNow, process the queue. While the queue is not empty:\n\n- Dequeue the front element (y, x, depth).\n\n- For each of the four directions:\n\n   - Compute ny = y + dy(k), nx = x + dx(k), where k is 1 to 4.\n\n   - Check if ny is between 1 and H, and nx between 1 and W (assuming 1-based indexing, which Fortran uses by default).\n\n   - If within bounds, check if flag(ny, nx) is 0 and A(ny, nx) is '.'.\n\n   - If so, set flag(ny, nx) = 1.\n\n   - Enqueue (ny, nx, depth + 1).\n\n   - Update ans to be max(ans, depth + 1).\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the queue is processed level by level. The ans is updated each time a new depth+1 is found. Since BFS proceeds level by level, the last depth encountered is the maximum depth, which is the answer. So in Fortran, each time a new element is added to the queue with depth+1, ans is updated to that depth+1. Since BFS processes elements in order of increasing depth, the last such update would be the maximum depth.\n\nBut in the Java code, the ans is updated every time a new cell is added. So in Fortran, each time a new cell is enqueued, we set ans to depth+1, which is the current depth of the parent plus one. Since the BFS proceeds in layers, the last such assignment will be the maximum depth.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, whenever a cell is added to the queue, ans is set to the depth+1 of that cell.\n\nNow, for the queue implementation:\n\nWe can use three arrays: y_queue, x_queue, depth_queue. These are 1D arrays with a maximum size of H*W.\n\nWe have two pointers: head and tail. Initially, head is 1 (the first element to be dequeued), tail is the number of initial elements (each '#' in A). The queue elements are added from the front to the tail.\n\nWait, in Java, the queue is a FIFO. So when elements are added, they go to the end. When dequeued, they are taken from the front.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the queue is implemented as a list where elements are added to the end and removed from the front. So the head starts at 1, and the tail starts at the initial number of elements. Each time we dequeue, we take the element at head, then increment head. Each time we enqueue, we increment tail and add the new element at tail.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so perhaps the queue is stored in an array of size say, H*W, and we have variables queue_head and queue_tail. Initially, queue_head is 1, queue_tail is 0. Then, for each initial element, we increment queue_tail and store the element at queue_tail. So the queue elements are from queue_head to queue_tail. If queue_head exceeds queue_tail, the queue is empty.\n\nSo for example, in the code:\n\nInitially, queue_head = 1, queue_tail = 0.\n\nLoop through all cells (i,j):\n\n   if A(i,j) is '#', then:\n\n      queue_tail = queue_tail + 1\n\n      y_queue(queue_tail) = i\n\n      x_queue(queue_tail) = j\n\n      depth_queue(queue_tail) = 0\n\nThen, during processing:\n\ndo while (queue_head <= queue_tail)\n\n   current_y = y_queue(queue_head)\n\n   current_x = x_queue(queue_head)\n\n   current_depth = depth_queue(queue_head)\n\n   queue_head = queue_head + 1\n\n   ... process this cell ...\n\n   for each direction:\n\n      compute ny, nx\n\n      check if in bounds.\n\n      check if flag(ny,nx) == 0 and A(ny,nx) == '.'\n\n      if yes:\n\n          flag(ny,nx) = 1\n\n          ans = current_depth + 1\n\n          queue_tail = queue_tail + 1\n\n          y_queue(queue_tail) = ny\n\n          x_queue(queue_tail) = nx\n\n          depth_queue(queue_tail) = current_depth + 1\n\nSo in this way, the queue is managed by moving the head and tail pointers.\n\nNow, handling the array indices:\n\nIn Java, the code uses 0-based indices. So when checking if y + dy[i] is between 0 and H-1, similarly for x.\n\nIn Fortran, using 1-based indices. So in the code, the dimensions are from 1 to H and 1 to W.\n\nSo when checking the neighbor's position, after adding dy and dx, need to check if ny is >=1 and <= H, nx >=1 and <= W.\n\nSo the dx and dy arrays in Java are {1, -1, 0, 0} and {0, 0, 1, -1}. So the four directions are down, up, right, left.\n\nBut in 1-based, moving in dx and dy terms:\n\ndx would be the change in x (column), dy the change in y (row). So the four directions would be:\n\nFor example, (dy=1, dx=0) means next row (down), (dy=-1, dx=0) means previous row (up), (dx=1, dy=0) next column (right), etc.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\ndx array is {1, -1, 0, 0} for x directions. Wait, no. Wait, in Java:\n\ndx is {1, -1, 0, 0}?\n\nWait, the dx array is:\n\ndx = {1, -1, 0, 0}\n\ndy = {0, 0, 1, -1}\n\nSo for each direction i (0 to 3):\n\nnew x is x + dx[i]\n\nnew y is y + dy[i]\n\nSo direction 0: dx=1, dy=0 \u2192 right.\n\ndirection 1: dx=-1 \u2192 left.\n\ndirection 2: dy=1 \u2192 down.\n\ndirection 3: dy=-1 \u2192 up.\n\nBut in Java's code, the matrix is H rows and W columns. So moving down increases the row index (since y is the row index). So dy=1 would be moving down a row.\n\nBut in Fortran, which uses 1-based indices, the same logic applies. So the directions are:\n\ndx would be [1, -1, 0, 0], dy [0, 0, 1, -1], but in Fortran, the indices are 1-based. So when adding dy[i], we need to ensure that the new y is within 1 to H.\n\nSo for example, for a cell at (y, x), checking neighbors:\n\nny = y + dy(i)\n\nnx = x + dx(i)\n\nwhere i ranges over 1 to 4 (since Fortran uses 1-based indices for arrays). So the dx and dy arrays need to be declared as (4) in Fortran, and the loop is from 1 to 4.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndx = [1, -1, 0, 0]\n\ndy = [0, 0, 1, -1]\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the original code, dx is the change in x (columns), dy is the change in y (rows). So each direction is:\n\ndx(1) = 1 \u2192 right.\n\ndx(2) = -1 \u2192 left.\n\ndy(3) = 1 \u2192 down.\n\ndy(4) = -1 \u2192 up.\n\nSo in Fortran, the dx and dy arrays would be:\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: dx = [1, -1, 0, 0]\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: dy = [0, 0, 1, -1]\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Java:\n\nThe dx array is {1, -1, 0, 0}, and the dy array is {0, 0, 1, -1}.\n\nSo for each i in 0..3:\n\ndx[i] and dy[i] give the direction.\n\nIn Java:\n\ni=0: dx=1 (right), dy=0 \u2192 move right.\n\ni=1: dx=-1 (left), dy=0 \u2192 move left.\n\ni=2: dx=0, dy=1 \u2192 move down (since y is row index).\n\ni=3: dx=0, dy=-1 \u2192 move up.\n\nIn Fortran, the same dx and dy values would be used, but the loop is over 1 to 4.\n\nSo dx(1) = 1, dx(2) = -1, dx(3) = 0, dx(4) = 0.\n\nSimilarly for dy.\n\nNow, the main loop.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the Java code, the flag array is initialized to all 0, and when a cell is processed (neighbors checked), the neighbor's flag is set to 1 when it's added to the queue.\n\nSo in Fortran, same logic.\n\nNow, for reading input:\n\nIn Java, each row is read as a string, then each character is stored in A[i][j].\n\nIn Fortran, reading each line as a character string, then assigning each character to A(i, j).\n\nBut Fortran has some issues with reading lines. So, for each row, read a character string of length W, then assign each character to A(i, 1:W).\n\nSo code:\n\ncharacter, dimension(H, W) :: A\n\ndo i = 1, H\n\n   read(*, '(A)') row\n\n   do j = 1, W\n\n      A(i, j) = row(j:j)\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nBut need to make sure that the row is read correctly. Alternatively, read the entire line and split into individual characters.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The queue size. So declaring y_queue, x_queue, depth_queue as arrays of size H*W.\n\nBut in Fortran, we need to allocate them. So in the code:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: y_queue(:), x_queue(:), depth_queue(:)\n\nallocate(y_queue(H*W), x_queue(H*W), depth_queue(H*W))\n\nBut in Fortran, the maximum size could be H*W. So during initialization, the queue_tail will be the number of initial '#' cells.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead H and W.\n\nRead H lines into A.\n\nInitialize queue with all '#' positions.\n\nInitialize flag array to 0.\n\nInitialize dx and dy arrays.\n\nProcess the queue as per BFS.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC033_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: H, W\n\ninteger :: i, j, k\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: row\n\ninteger, allocatable :: y_queue(:), x_queue(:), depth_queue(:)\n\ninteger :: queue_head, queue_tail\n\ninteger, allocatable :: flag(:,:)\n\ninteger :: current_y, current_x, current_depth\n\ninteger :: ans\n\ninteger :: dx(4), dy(4)\n\ninteger :: ny, nx\n\n!

Deallocate memory\n\ndeallocate(y_queue, x_queue, depth_queue, flag, A)\n\nend program atcoder_AGC033_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the declaration of A as a character array. How is it allocated?\n\nIn Fortran, for a character array, you can declare it as:\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(H, W) :: A\n\nBecause each element is a single character.\n\nSo, during allocation:\n\nallocate(character(len=1) :: A(H, W))\n\nBut in the code above, perhaps the code should declare A as:\n\ncharacter(len=1), allocatable, dimension(:,:) :: A\n\nThen allocate:\n\nallocate(A(H, W))\n\nBut when reading each row, we need to read a string of length W and assign each character to A(i,j).\n\nSo the code:\n\ncharacter(len=1), allocatable :: A(:,:)\n\nread H, W.\n\nallocate(A(H, W))\n\ndo i = 1, H\n\n   read(*, '(A)') row ! row is a string of length W.\n\n   do j = 1, W\n\n      A(i, j) = row(j:j)\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nSo, for each row, read into a string, then split into characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, the variable 'row' must be a character variable of length W. So, before reading:\n\ncharacter(len=W) :: row\n\nBut if W is read at runtime, then we need to use a deferred-length character variable. So:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: row\n\nOnce H and W are read, allocate row as length W.\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't declare the length dynamically for a variable in that way. So perhaps:\n\nread H and W.\n\nallocate(character(len=W) :: row)\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to H:\n\nread(*, '(A)') row\n\nthen assign A(i, 1:W) = transfer(row, 'a', size=A(i,1:W)) ? Or perhaps:\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, assigning a string to an array of characters.\n\nWait, if row is a character(len=W) variable, then row(j:j) gives the j-th character.\n\nSo, for each i, j:\n\nA(i, j) = row(j:j)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC033_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: H, W, i, j, k, queue_head, queue_tail, current_y, current_x, current_depth, ny, nx, ans\n\ncharacter(len=1), allocatable :: A(:,:)\n\ninteger, allocatable :: y_queue(:), x_queue(:), depth_queue(:), flag(:,:)\n\ninteger :: dx(4), dy(4)\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: row\n\n!

So in the Fortran code, the 'ans' is set to current_depth + 1 each time a valid neighbor is found and added.

Let's think. All cells except center are '.', and the center is '#'. So BFS starts from the center. The first layer (depth 1) is the four adjacent cells. Then the next layer (depth 2) are the cells around those. So the maximum depth is 2.\n\nSo in Fortran code, ans should be 2.\n\nAnother test case: initial input with all '#' would output 0.\n\nAnother test case: a single '.' surrounded by '#'s. Like 3x3 grid, with center '.' and all others '#'. Then the ans is 1.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nPotential issues in the Fortran code:\n\n- Handling of the queue when queue_tail exceeds the allocated size. But in the code, the queue is allocated to H*W, which is the maximum possible elements. So it's safe.\n\n- 1-based vs 0-based indices. The code uses 1-based.\n\n- The directions: dx and dy are correctly set.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be correct."
