For example, if the line is 'aba', then s will be 'aba' (if n=3). So the code for reading is okay. Testing the code: Sample input 1:\n3\naba\nbab\naba\n\nAfter reading, the arr will be:\n\nRow 1: a, b, a\n\nRow 2: b, a, b\n\nRow 3: a, b, a\n\nThe diagonals (i=j) are a, a, a. The anti-diagonal (i+j=4) are a, a, a. So a is 'a', b is 'b'.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n, then reads n strings. Each string is stored in a 2D character array. The code checks two conditions: the diagonal elements (both main diagonal and anti-diagonal) should all be the same character 'a', and the rest should be 'b'. Also, 'a' and 'b' must be different. If these conditions are met, it prints YES, else NO.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n strings and store them in a 2D array.\n3. Check if the diagonals are all the same as the first character (arr[0][0]).\n4. Check if the non-diagonal elements are the same as the second character (arr[0][1]).\n5. Ensure that the two characters are different.\n6. Output YES or NO based on these checks.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran. Let me think about the differences between Java and Fortran.\n\nFortran uses static typing, so variables need to be declared with their types. The input handling is different. In Java, they use a Scanner to read inputs. In Fortran, I'll use read statements.\n\nFor the 2D array, in Java it's a char array, but in Fortran, characters can be stored in a 2D array or maybe as an array of strings. Since each row in Java is a string, perhaps in Fortran, we can use an array of character strings, each of length n.\n\nSo, declare a character array of dimension n, each element being a string of length n. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: str(n)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when reading n, we can't have the length of the character depend on n unless we use allocatable arrays. Hmm, maybe read each line as a string and process each character.\n\nAlternatively, since in Fortran, 2D character arrays can be a bit tricky. Let's see. Maybe we can have a 2D array where each element is a single character. So, declare arr(n,n) as characters of length 1.\n\nSo, the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n. Then, for each line, store each character into the arr array.\n\nWait, how to read the lines? For example, if the input lines are like:\n\n3\naba\nbab\naba\n\nEach line after the first is a string of length 3. So in Fortran, each line can be read into a string variable of length n, then each character can be accessed by position.\n\nSo, first read n. Then loop i from 1 to n, read a string s of length n, and assign arr(i, j) = s(j:j) for each j from 1 to n.\n\nYes. So the code would be something like:\n\ninteger :: n\nread(*,*) n\ncharacter(len=n) :: s\ncharacter(len=1) :: arr(n,n)\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) s\n    do j = 1, n\n        arr(i,j) = s(j:j)\n    end do\nend do\n\nThen, get the first character a = arr(1,1), and b = arr(1,2). Wait, in Java, the array is 0-based, but in Fortran, it's 1-based. So need to adjust indices.\n\nThen check if a == b. If yes, print 'NO'.\n\nOtherwise, check all positions. For each i and j, if i == j or i + j == n + 1 (since in 1-based indices, the anti-diagonal elements satisfy i + j = n + 1), then check if arr(i,j) == a. Otherwise, check if arr(i,j) == b.\n\nSet a logical flag res to true. If any check fails, set res to false and exit loops.\n\nFinally, output 'YES' or 'NO' based on res.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, j\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n    character(len=1), allocatable :: arr(:,:)\n    character(len=1) :: a, b\n    logical :: res\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(arr(n, n))\n    allocate(character(len=n) :: s)\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) s\n        do j = 1, n\n            arr(i, j) = s(j:j)\n        end do\n    end do\n    a = arr(1,1)\n    b = arr(1,2)\n    if (a == b) then\n        print *, 'NO'\n    else\n        res = .true.\n        do i = 1, n\n            do j = 1, n\n                if (i == j .or. i + j == n + 1) then\n                    if (arr(i,j) /= a) then\n                        res = .false.\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                else\n                    if (arr(i,j) /= b) then\n                        res = .false.\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (.not. res) exit\n        end do\n        if (res) then\n            print *, 'YES'\n        else\n            print *, 'NO'\n        end if\n    end if\nend program\n\nWait, but in the code, when we read s, each line is read into s, which is allocated to length n. Then each character is stored into arr(i,j). That should work.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read a string with read(*,*) s, it may not read the entire line if there are spaces, but in the problem input, each line is a single string without spaces. So using list-directed input (read(*,*)) is okay here.\n\nBut let's test with an example. Suppose n is 3 and the input lines are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. The code reads each line into s, which is length 3, then splits into characters. That should work.\n\nAnother thing: in Java, the code breaks out of the loops once res is false. So in Fortran, the loops are nested, and when a discrepancy is found, set res to false, then exit the inner loop, and check in the outer loop to exit.\n\nYes, the code uses exit to leave the inner j loop, then checks if res is false and exits the i loop.\n\nNow, possible issues: array indices, allocation, and the way characters are read.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses allocatable variables. So need to allocate them properly. For s, after reading n, allocate it with length n. Then for arr, allocate as (n,n).\n\nBut in Fortran, when you allocate character(len=1) :: arr(n,n), each element is a single character. That should be correct.\n\nAnother possible problem is the initial allocation of s. Wait, in the code:\n\nallocate(character(len=n) :: s)\n\nYes, that's correct. So s is a single string of length n.\n\nBut when reading each line into s, it's read as a single string. For example, if the line is 'aba', then s will be 'aba' (if n=3).\n\nSo the code for reading is okay.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nSample input 1:\n3\naba\nbab\naba\n\nAfter reading, the arr will be:\n\nRow 1: a, b, a\n\nRow 2: b, a, b\n\nRow 3: a, b, a\n\nThe diagonals (i=j) are a, a, a. The anti-diagonal (i+j=4) are a, a, a. So a is 'a', b is 'b'. All other positions should be 'b'. Let's see:\n\nCheck row 1, j=2: 'b' (correct).\n\nRow 2, j=1: 'b' (correct), j=3: 'b' (correct).\n\nSo output is YES.\n\nBut according to the Java code, since a and b are different, and all conditions met, output is YES.\n\nAnother sample input where a and b are same:\n\nn=2\n\naa\n\naa\n\nThen a and b are both 'a', so output 'NO'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nPotential mistakes:\n\n- Forgetting to adjust from 0-based to 1-based indexing.\n\n- The anti-diagonal condition: in Java, i + j == n-1 (since 0-based). In Fortran, since indices start at 1, i + j == n +1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: in the Java code, after setting res = false, there's a break, which exits the inner loop. Then, in the outer loop, after the inner loop, the code checks if res is false and breaks. In Fortran, the same is done with exit in the inner loop, then checking if res is false and exiting the outer loop.\n\nSo the logic is preserved.\n\nI think this should work. Now, writing the Fortran code accordingly."
