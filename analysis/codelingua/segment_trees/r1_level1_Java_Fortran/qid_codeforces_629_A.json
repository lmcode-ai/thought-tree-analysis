Process columns\nDO i = 1, num\n    counter = 0\n    DO k = 1, num\n        IF (arr(k, i) == 'C') THEN\n            counter = counter + 1\n        END IF\n    END DO\n    fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) / 2\nEND DO\n\n!

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does first. \n\nThe program reads an integer 'num', then reads 'num' lines of strings. It then calculates the number of pairs of 'C's in each row and column. The formula used is (counter * (counter -1))/2 for each row and column, summing them all up. Finally, it prints the total.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. In Fortran, I need to handle input, arrays, loops, and the calculations. \n\nFirst, the input part. Java uses Scanner to read input. In Fortran, I'll use READ statements. The first input is an integer 'num', then 'num' strings. So, I'll read 'num' first, then a loop to read each string. But Fortran's strings are fixed-length, so I need to declare a character array with a specific length. Let's say each line is up to, say, 100 characters. So, declaring a dimension (num) array of characters of length 100. Then, for each line, read into that array.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, each string is stored in an ArrayList. So in Fortran, maybe a 2D array where each row is a string. But each string is a row in the original input. Wait, actually, the Java code's arr is a list of strings. Each string represents a row. Then, for each i, they check the i-th column by looping through each row's i-th character. So in Fortran, perhaps a 2D array where arr(i,j) represents the j-th character of the i-th row.\n\nWait, Java's arr.get(k).charAt(i) would be the i-th character of the k-th string. So in Fortran, if we have a 2D array arr(num, num), where each element is a character, then arr(k, i) would correspond. Because in Java, each string is a row, and each row's i-th character is accessed. So in Fortran, maybe arr is a 2D array with dimensions (num, num), where each row is a string. Wait, but each string's length is 'num', since the input is a square (since for i and k up to num-1). So for each row, the string has exactly 'num' characters. So in Fortran, the array can be declared as a 2D array of characters with size (num, num). \n\nSo in Fortran, when reading each line, each line is a string of length 'num'. So for each line, read into a row of the array. For example, the i-th row of the array would be the i-th string. So for i from 1 to num, read the string into arr(i, :). But in Fortran, when reading a string into a character array, you can read it as a whole. Hmm.\n\nWait, Fortran's handling of character arrays can be a bit tricky. Let's think: perhaps declare the array as a 2D character variable of size (num, num). Then, for each row i, read a string of length num into arr(i, 1:num). So each row i of the array holds the characters of the i-th input string. So the element arr(i,j) is the j-th character of the i-th string. \n\nSo for example, in Java, arr.get(k).charAt(i) would be arr(k+1, i+1) in Fortran if indices are 1-based.\n\nWait, Java uses 0-based indices. So in the code, for loops run from 0 to num-1. In Fortran, loops are typically 1-based, but it's up to me. Let's adjust for that.\n\nSo the first loop in Java for i in 0..num-1, then for k in 0..num-1, checks arr.get(k).charAt(i) which is the i-th column of the k-th row. So in Fortran, if the array is declared as (num rows, num columns), then the column index would be i+1 and row k+1. So in Fortran, to check the (i+1)th column of the (k+1)th row. Wait, no. Wait, arr.get(k) is the k-th row in Java (since they added each string to the list in order). So the first index (k) is the row, and the i is the column. So arr(k).charAt(i) is the i-th character in the k-th row. So in Fortran, that would be arr(k+1, i+1) if the array is 1-based. So, in Fortran, to loop over columns and rows:\n\nFor columns (i in Java from 0 to num-1) which is the column index. For each column i, loop over each row k (from 0 to num-1) and check if the character at (k, i) is 'C'. Then, count how many Cs in that column, compute combinations, add to 'fine'.\n\nSimilarly, for rows: loop over each row, check each character in the row, count Cs in that row, add combinations to 'fine'.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code structure would be:\n\nRead num.\n\nAllocate or declare a 2D character array of size (num, num).\n\nRead num lines, each line into a row of the array.\n\nInitialize fine to 0.\n\nFirst, process columns: for each column (i from 1 to num), count the number of Cs in that column across all rows. Then add (count*(count-1))/2 to fine.\n\nThen process rows: for each row (i from 1 to num), count the number of Cs in that row. Add (count*(count-1))/2 to fine.\n\nFinally, print fine.\n\nSo how to read the lines into the array? For each row, read a string of length num. Then, assign each character of the string to the corresponding column in that row.\n\nIn Fortran, if I have a character variable, say, line of length num, then read each line into line, then assign arr(i, :) = line. Wait, but in Fortran, you can assign the entire row. For example, if arr is declared as CHARACTER(len=1), DIMENSION(num, num) :: arr, then for each row i, reading a string into a variable and then assign arr(i, 1:num) = ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=num) :: line\nCHARACTER(LEN=1) :: arr(num, num)\n\nDO i = 1, num\n    READ(*, '(A)') line\n    DO j = 1, num\n        arr(i, j) = line(j:j)\n    END DO\nEND DO\n\nBut wait, each line is of length num. So when read into line, which is declared as length num, each character j in the line can be accessed as line(j:j), then assigned to arr(i,j).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an array of strings. Like, declaring the array as a 1D array of strings of length num, each representing a row. Then, for row i, the j-th character is line(i)(j:j). But maybe the 2D array approach is better for easier access.\n\nSo, the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead num.\n\nDeclare variables: integer :: num, counter, fine, i, j, k\n\nRead num lines into a 2D array of characters.\n\nThen, loop over columns (i from 1 to num):\n\ncounter = 0\n\nloop over rows (k from 1 to num):\n\nif arr(k, i) == 'C' then counter = counter +1\n\nend loop\n\nfine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) /2\n\nThen, loop over rows (i from 1 to num):\n\ncounter =0\n\nloop over columns (j from 1 to num):\n\nif arr(i,j) == 'C' then counter +=1\n\nend loop\n\nfine += (counter*(counter-1))/2\n\nFinally, print fine.\n\nSo the main steps are translating the loops and the array accesses.\n\nNow, the code structure in Fortran:\n\nPROGRAM main\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER :: num, counter, fine, i, j, k\nCHARACTER(LEN=1), ALLOCATABLE :: arr(:,:)\nCHARACTER(LEN=100) :: line  ! assuming lines are up to 100 chars, but since num can vary, maybe better to read into a variable length?\n\n! Read num\nREAD(*,*) num\n\n! Allocate arr as (num rows, num columns)\nALLOCATE(arr(num, num))\n\n! Read each line into arr\nDO i = 1, num\n    READ(*, '(A)') line\n    ! Now, take the first num characters from line and assign to arr(i, 1:num)\n    DO j = 1, num\n        arr(i, j) = line(j:j)\n    END DO\nEND DO\n\nfine = 0\n\n! Process columns\nDO i = 1, num\n    counter = 0\n    DO k = 1, num\n        IF (arr(k, i) == 'C') THEN\n            counter = counter + 1\n        END IF\n    END DO\n    fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) / 2\nEND DO\n\n! Process rows\nDO i = 1, num\n    counter = 0\n    DO j = 1, num\n        IF (arr(i, j) == 'C') THEN\n            counter = counter +1\n        END IF\n    END DO\n    fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) / 2\nEND DO\n\nPRINT *, fine\n\nEND PROGRAM\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when processing columns, the outer loop is over i (columns), inner loop over k (rows). Then, for each i, check arr.get(k).charAt(i) which is the k-th row's i-th character. So in Fortran, arr(k, i+1) if Java's i is 0-based. But in the Fortran code, the loops are from 1 to num, and arr is 1-based. So in the code above, when i is the column index (from 1 to num), k is the row index (from 1 to num), so arr(k, i) is correct.\n\nSame for rows: for each row i, check each column j (from 1 to num), arr(i, j) is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The input lines must be exactly of length num. So when reading each line, we need to take exactly num characters. The code above uses a loop j from 1 to num and takes line(j:j). So even if the input line has more characters (unlikely, given the problem's constraints), but the code will take the first num characters.\n\nBut in Java, the code reads each string via sc.next(), which reads tokens separated by whitespace. Wait, but the original Java code uses sc.next() to read each string, which reads the next token (so it skips whitespace). So each line in input is a single token (like a string of 'C's and '.'s, perhaps). So in Fortran, when reading each line, using format (A) would read the entire line, including any leading spaces. But that's a problem. Because in Java's sc.next() skips leading whitespace and reads the next token. So perhaps in Fortran, the code should read the line, but the actual string is the first num characters. Wait, no. For example, if the input is given as each line being a sequence of 'C' and '.' with no spaces, then the Java code reads each line as a single token. So in Fortran, when reading each line, the entire line (including leading spaces, but the problem probably expects that each line is exactly num characters long, without leading spaces). So perhaps the code above is correct.\n\nBut if the user inputs lines with leading or trailing spaces, then the code would not work as intended. But according to the problem statement, probably the input is correct. So the code assumes that each line is exactly num characters long, and the Fortran code reads each line as a whole, then takes the first num characters. So the code above should work.\n\nAnother thing: the variable 'line' in Fortran is declared as length 100. So if num is larger than 100, this will cause an error. So perhaps better to read the line into a variable with a dynamic length. But Fortran requires fixed-length strings. So perhaps the code should declare line as CHARACTER(LEN=num) and then read into it. Wait, but num is read at runtime. So in Fortran, you can have a variable-length input. Wait, no. Fortran requires that the length of a character variable is determined at compile time. So in order to read a line of exactly num characters, perhaps using a temporary array.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line into a variable with a sufficient maximum length (like 1000) and then take the first num characters. The code above uses line as length 100, which is a problem if num>100. So to make it more general, perhaps set line to a larger size, like 1000, and then process the first num characters.\n\nSo changing the declaration to CHARACTER(LEN=1000) :: line.\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nDO j = 1, num\n    arr(i, j) = line(j:j)\nEND DO\n\nThis way, even if num is up to 1000, it's okay. But the code may have issues if num exceeds 1000. But given that programming competition problems usually have constraints (like num up to 100), this should be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, after reading num, allocate a character variable of length num. Wait, but in Fortran, you cannot have a variable-length character variable with length determined at runtime. Unless using Fortran 2003's allocatable character variables, but that might complicate things. Let me check.\n\nIn Fortran 2003 and later, you can have allocatable character variables. For example:\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=:), ALLOCATABLE :: line\n\nThen, after reading num, allocate line with length num.\n\nBut that's possible. Let's try that.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nAfter reading num:\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=:), ALLOCATABLE :: line\nALLOCATE(CHARACTER(num) :: line)\n\nThen, for each row:\n\nREAD(*, '(A)') line\n\nThen, assign arr(i, 1:num) to the characters in line.\n\nBut how to split the line into individual characters. Because line is a string of length num. So line(j:j) gives the j-th character.\n\nYes. So perhaps this approach is better.\n\nSo adjusting the code:\n\nPROGRAM main\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER :: num, counter, fine, i, j, k\nCHARACTER(LEN=1), ALLOCATABLE :: arr(:,:)\nCHARACTER(LEN=:), ALLOCATABLE :: line\n\nREAD(*,*) num\n\nALLOCATE(arr(num, num))\nALLOCATE(CHARACTER(num) :: line)\n\nDO i = 1, num\n    READ(*, '(A)') line\n    DO j = 1, num\n        arr(i, j) = line(j:j)\n    END DO\nEND DO\n\nfine = 0\n\n! Process columns\nDO i = 1, num\n    counter = 0\n    DO k = 1, num\n        IF (arr(k, i) == 'C') THEN\n            counter = counter + 1\n        END IF\n    END DO\n    fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) / 2\nEND DO\n\n! Process rows\nDO i = 1, num\n    counter = 0\n    DO j = 1, num\n        IF (arr(i, j) == 'C') THEN\n            counter = counter + 1\n        END IF\n    END DO\n    fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) / 2\nEND DO\n\nPRINT *, fine\n\nEND PROGRAM\n\nThis should handle num up to any size, as line is allocated to exactly num characters. So this is better.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Fortran, integer division is truncating. So when (counter * (counter-1)) is divided by 2, if it's even or odd, it should be okay. For example, if counter is 4, then 4*3=12/2=6, which is correct. So that part is the same as in Java.\n\nSo this code should work. Let's test with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose input is:\n\n3\nCCC\nCCC\nCCC\n\nThe Java code would compute for each column and row.\n\nEach row has 3 Cs, so per row: 3*2/2=3. 3 rows: 9. Each column also 3 Cs: 3*2/2=3, 3 columns: 9. Total 18.\n\nIn Fortran code, same result.\n\nAnother test case: input 2, with 'CC' and 'CC'.\n\nEach row and column has 2 Cs. Each row contributes 1, each column 1. Total (2 rows *1) + (2 cols *1) =4. Output 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPotential issues in code:\n\n- The format for reading the lines: when reading with '(A)', it may read the entire line, but if the input lines have trailing spaces or other characters beyond num, it would cause problems. But the problem likely ensures that each line is exactly num characters. So this code should handle that correctly.\n\n- Fortran's array indices start at 1. The Java code uses 0-based indices, but the Fortran code uses 1-based, which is correctly translated.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java code's functionality."
