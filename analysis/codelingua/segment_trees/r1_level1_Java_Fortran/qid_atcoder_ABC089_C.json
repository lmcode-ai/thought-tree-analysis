    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first. The program counts the number of names starting with M, A, R, C, H. Then it calculates the sum of all possible triple products of these counts. Because selecting three different groups gives the number of possible triples, and multiplying their counts gives the combinations.\n\nSo in Fortran, I'll need to read an integer n, then read n strings, check their first character, and increment the respective counters. Then compute the sum of all possible combinations of three different counters.\n\nFirst, how to handle input in Fortran. In Java, they use Scanner and next(), but in Fortran, I can read from standard input using READ statements. So variables: maybe an integer n, then loop n times, read a string each time. Check the first character and update the counts.\n\nIn Java, the counts are stored in a long array of size 5. In Fortran, I'll need an array of integers, but since the product can be large, maybe use integer(kind=8) to handle large numbers, similar to Java's long.\n\nWait, Java's long is 64-bit. Fortran's default integer might be 32-bit, but using integer(8) would give 64-bit. So declare the cnt array as integer(8), dimension(5) :: cnt, initialized to zero.\n\nThen, for each input string, check the first character. So, in Fortran, when you read a string, say 'MARCH', the first character is str(1:1) since Fortran is 1-based. So check if that's 'M', 'A', etc., and increment the respective cnt.\n\nOnce all counts are gathered, compute the sum of all possible triple products. The Java code lists all 10 possible combinations of three different indices. Because the five elements are 0 to 4. The combinations are:\n\n0,1,2; 0,1,3; 0,1,4; 0,2,3; 0,2,4; 0,3,4; 1,2,3; 1,2,4; 1,3,4; 2,3,4. So 10 terms.\n\nInstead of hardcoding all 10 terms, maybe find a smarter way, but for code translation, the direct approach is to write all 10 terms as in the Java code. Because the original code does that, so translating that directly would be straightforward.\n\nSo in Fortran, calculate res as the sum of each product. So:\n\nres = cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + ... etc. But wait, in Java, the array is 0-based. So in the Java code, cnt[0] is 'M', cnt[1] is 'A', etc. So in Fortran, the cnt array is 1-based. So cnt(1) corresponds to Java's cnt[0], cnt(2) to cnt[1], etc.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\n- cnt[0] is M\n- cnt[1] is A\n- cnt[2] is R\n- cnt[3] is C\n- cnt[4] is H\n\nIn Fortran, the array will be 1-based, so:\n\ncnt(1) is M\ncnt(2) is A\ncnt(3) is R\ncnt(4) is C\ncnt(5) is H\n\nSo when translating the terms, for example, Java's cnt[0] * cnt[1] * cnt[2] becomes cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) in Fortran.\n\nSo the original Java code's res calculation:\n\nres = cnt[0]*cnt[1]*cnt[2] + ... (10 terms). Each term is the product of three distinct elements.\n\nSo in Fortran, each term is the product of three elements from the cnt array, where the indices correspond to the Java's indices plus 1.\n\nSo for each of the 10 terms in Java:\n\nTerm 0: 0,1,2 \u2192 Fortran 1,2,3 \u2192 product cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3)\nTerm 1: 0,1,3 \u2192 1,2,4 \u2192 product cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4)\nTerm 2: 0,1,4 \u2192 1,2,5 \u2192 product cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(5)\nTerm 3: 0,2,3 \u2192 1,3,4 \u2192 product cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(4)\nTerm 4: 0,2,4 \u2192 1,3,5 \u2192 product cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(5)\nTerm 5: 0,3,4 \u2192 1,4,5 \u2192 product cnt(1)*cnt(4)*cnt(5)\nTerm 6: 1,2,3 \u2192 2,3,4 \u2192 product cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(4)\nTerm 7: 1,2,4 \u2192 2,3,5 \u2192 product cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(5)\nTerm 8: 1,3,4 \u2192 2,4,5 \u2192 product cnt(2)*cnt(4)*cnt(5)\nTerm 9: 2,3,4 \u21923,4,5 \u2192 product cnt(3)*cnt(4)*cnt(5)\n\nSo all these 10 terms need to be added.\n\nSo the res in Fortran will be the sum of these 10 terms.\n\nSo in code, res = cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + ... etc.\n\nThen, print the result.\n\nNow, handling the input. For reading n, then n strings.\n\nIn Fortran, reading a line with n is straightforward: read(*,*) n.\n\nThen loop i from 1 to n, read each string. Each string can be read as a character variable. The length can be set to a sufficient size, like 100. So declare character(100) :: str.\n\nThen for each str, check the first character: if (str(1:1) == 'M') then cnt(1) = cnt(1) + 1, etc.\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading strings with the read statement, if the input is longer than the declared length, it will be truncated. So declaring a length of 100 should be sufficient.\n\nBut in practice, the input strings may have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the Java code, it uses next(), which reads the next token (whitespace separated). So in Fortran, reading with read(*,*) str will read space-separated tokens, which matches the Java code's behavior. Because in Java, in.next() reads the next token.\n\nSo in Fortran, each read(*,*) str will read the next token, so leading whitespace is skipped. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Initialize cnt array (5 elements) to zero.\n\n3. Loop i from 1 to n:\n\n   a. Read str.\n\n   b. Check first character and increment the corresponding cnt.\n\n4. Calculate res as sum of all 10 possible products.\n\n5. Print res.\n\nNow, for the Fortran code:\n\nDeclarations:\n\ninteger(8) :: n, i\ninteger(8), dimension(5) :: cnt = 0\ncharacter(100) :: str\ninteger(8) :: res\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the variables are declared with their types. So:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer(8) :: n, i\n  integer(8), dimension(5) :: cnt = [0_8, 0_8, 0_8, 0_8, 0_8]\n  character(100) :: str\n  integer(8) :: res\n\nBut wait, initializing the cnt array. In Fortran, you can initialize it with (/ 0_8, 0_8, ... /) but for 5 elements. Alternatively, use cnt = 0_8, but for array assignment. Wait, perhaps:\n\ncnt = 0_8\n\nBut for a dimension(5) array, this would set all elements to zero. But since in Fortran, the initialization in the declaration would need to be done properly.\n\nAlternatively, declare cnt as:\n\ninteger(8) :: cnt(5) = 0\n\nBut maybe in Fortran, the kind parameter is needed. So 0_8 to specify 64-bit integers.\n\nWait, integer(8) refers to 8-byte integers. So initializing each element as 0_8.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger(8) :: cnt(5) = [0_8, 0_8, 0_8, 0_8, 0_8]\n\nBut in Fortran, array constructors are written with (/ ... /) or [ ... ] if using Fortran 2003 or newer.\n\nBut some compilers may require the use of the data statement. However, for simplicity, perhaps initialize the array in the code.\n\nAlternatively, after declaring, set cnt = 0_8.\n\nBut in Fortran, the statement cnt = 0_8 would set all elements to zero. So perhaps:\n\nAfter reading n, set cnt = 0_8.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\ncnt = 0_8\n\ndo i = 1, n\n   read(*,*) str\n   select case (str(1:1))\n      case ('M')\n          cnt(1) = cnt(1) + 1\n      case ('A')\n          cnt(2) = cnt(2) + 1\n      case ('R')\n          cnt(3) = cnt(3) + 1\n      case ('C')\n          cnt(4) = cnt(4) + 1\n      case ('H')\n          cnt(5) = cnt(5) + 1\n      case default\n          ! do nothing\n   end select\nend do\n\nThen compute res.\n\nres = cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(5) + &\n      cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(5) + cnt(1)*cnt(4)*cnt(5) + &\n      cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(5) + cnt(2)*cnt(4)*cnt(5) + &\n      cnt(3)*cnt(4)*cnt(5)\n\nThen print res.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, all 10 combinations are added. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the print statement. Since res is an integer(8), we can write it as:\n\nprint *, res\n\nBut in some Fortran compilers, the format may not handle very large integers. However, using list-directed output (*) should work.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, the Java code's cnt array counts the number of names starting with M, A, R, C, H. Other starting letters are ignored, which is handled in the case default.\n\nSo the Fortran code should have a select case on the first character of the string.\n\nNow, testing for str(1:1) may need to ensure that the string is not empty. But according to the problem statement, the input strings are valid, so perhaps no need. But in practice, if a string is empty, str(1:1) would cause an error. But according to the problem, each name is non-empty, so safe.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer(8) :: n, i\n  integer(8) :: cnt(5)\n  character(100) :: str\n  integer(8) :: res\n\n  read(*,*) n\n  cnt = 0_8\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) str\n    select case (str(1:1))\n      case ('M')\n        cnt(1) = cnt(1) + 1\n      case ('A')\n        cnt(2) = cnt(2) + 1\n      case ('R')\n        cnt(3) = cnt(3) + 1\n      case ('C')\n        cnt(4) = cnt(4) + 1\n      case ('H')\n        cnt(5) = cnt(5) + 1\n      case default\n        ! do nothing\n    end select\n  end do\n\n  res = cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(5) + &\n        cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(5) + cnt(1)*cnt(4)*cnt(5) + &\n        cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(5) + cnt(2)*cnt(4)*cnt(5) + &\n        cnt(3)*cnt(4)*cnt(5)\n\n  print *, res\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the continuation lines use '&' at the end of the line. So each line after the first must start with an '&' if splitting a statement across lines. Alternatively, the '&' can be placed at the end of the line to continue.\n\nIn the code above, the res calculation is split into multiple lines using '&' at the end of each line. That should be correct.\n\nYes, the code looks okay. Let me check the indices again. Java's cnt[0] is M \u2192 Fortran cnt(1). So the first term in Java is cnt[0] * cnt[1] * cnt[2] \u2192 cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3). Correct.\n\nSo all the terms are correctly translated. The sum of all 10 possible combinations is calculated.\n\nSo this should be the correct Fortran translation."
