    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The program reads three integers from the input, splits them into variables x, a, y (wait, maybe the variable names are different? Let me check the Java code again). Oh right, the Java code reads a line, splits it into three parts: list[0], list[1], list[2], and assigns them to x, a, y. Then it checks if any of them is 5 or 7, and if their sum is 17. If both conditions are met, it outputs \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nWait, the initial check in Java is using bitwise OR (|), but since Java's | is a bitwise operator, but here they're using it in a conditional where they probably intended logical OR. However, in Java, for boolean conditions, the | operator works as a non-short-circuit logical OR. So the condition is checking if any of x, a, or y is 5 or 7. Wait, no: the condition is (x ==5 | x==7 | a ==5 | a==7 | y ==5 | y==7). So if any of the three variables is 5 or 7. Then, if their sum is 17, set h to YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nSo the first step is to read three integers from input. In Fortran, we can use READ(*,*) to read from standard input. Then split them into three variables. Let's name them x, a, y as in the Java code.\n\nWait, the Java code uses x, a, y. But in the list, the variables are assigned as x = list[0], a = list[1], y = list[2]. So the order is first, second, third. So when translating, the order of reading would be the same.\n\nSo the Fortran code will read three integers into variables x, a, y.\n\nThen, check if any of x, a, y is 5 or 7. Wait, the Java code's first condition is if (x ==5 | x==7 | a ==5 | a==7 | y ==5 | y==7). So if any of the three variables is 5 or 7, then proceed to check the sum. Then, if the sum is 17, output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nWait, but the code says: if (the first condition is true) then check if sum is 17. If both, then YES. Else, even if sum is 17 but none of the variables are 5 or 7, then it's NO. Because the initial condition requires that at least one variable is 5 or 7.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to replicate this logic.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read three integers.\n\n2. Check if any of them is 5 or 7. (Using logical ORs.)\n\n3. If that's true, then check if their sum is 17.\n\n4. If both conditions are met, output YES; else NO.\n\nNow, in Fortran, logical OR is .OR. but in this case, for multiple conditions, we can chain them. Also, need to check each variable against 5 or 7.\n\nSo the first condition would be:\n\nif (x ==5 .or. x==7 .or. a ==5 .or. a==7 .or. y ==5 .or. y==7) then\n\nThen, check if (x + a + y) == 17.\n\nSo, if both conditions are met, then h is \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nNow, in Fortran, the variables are integers, and the string variable h can be initialized to 'NO' first, then set to 'YES' if conditions are met.\n\nNow, for the input, the Java code reads a line and splits it. So the Fortran code should read three integers from the input line. Using READ(*,*) x, a, y.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x, a, y\n    character(len=3) :: h = 'NO'\n\n    read(*,*) x, a, y\n\n    if ( (x ==5 .or. x ==7 .or. a ==5 .or. a ==7 .or. y ==5 .or. y ==7) ) then\n        if (x + a + y ==17) then\n            h = 'YES'\n        end if\n    end if\n\n    print *, h\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the order of variables when reading: when you read with read(*,*) x, a, y, the input line should have three integers separated by spaces, which matches the Java code's approach.\n\nBut in the Java code, the variables are named x, a, y, but perhaps that's a typo? Because in the original Java code, the line is:\n\nint x = Integer.parseInt(list[0]);\nint a = Integer.parseInt(list[1]);\nint y = Integer.parseInt(list[2]);\n\nSo the variables are x (first number), a (second), y (third). So the sum is x + a + y.\n\nYes. So in the Fortran code, that's correct.\n\nNow, the initial check is if any of the three variables is 5 or 7. Then check sum.\n\nSo the code should work as expected.\n\nTesting with sample inputs.\n\nFor example, if input is 5 5 7: sum is 17. All are 5 or 7. So output YES.\n\nAnother example: 5 5 7 \u2192 5+5+7=17 \u2192 YES.\n\nIf input is 5 6 6: sum is 17? 5+6+6=17 \u2192 sum is 17. And x is 5. So first condition is true, sum is 17 \u2192 YES.\n\nBut if input is 6 6 5: sum is 17, and one of them is 5 \u2192 YES.\n\nIf input is 5 5 7 \u2192 sum 17, yes.\n\nBut if input is 4 6 7 \u2192 sum is 17? 4+6+7=17. Then 7 is present. So YES.\n\nWhat about input 4 6 7 \u2192 sum is 17, and one is 7. So yes.\n\nBut if the sum is 17 but none are 5 or 7: for example, 3 6 8: sum 17. But none are 5 or 7. So the code outputs NO.\n\nWhich is correct according to the Java code's logic.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java code's behavior."
