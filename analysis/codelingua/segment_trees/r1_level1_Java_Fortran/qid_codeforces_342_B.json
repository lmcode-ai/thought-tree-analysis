The first line has three integers: m, s, f. Wait, looking again, the input line is split into parts. The first input array's index 1 is m, 2 is s, 3 is f. So the first line is something like \"n m s f\", maybe? Because the input array is split from the first line, and the first element (index 0) is probably ignored? Or maybe the original code has a typo? Let me check.\n\nWait, the original code's input line is split into input[], then m is parsed from input[1], s from input[2], f from input[3]. So the first line must have four integers, where the first is perhaps unused. But the Java code's input line processing is a bit unclear. Let me see: the first line is read via reader.readLine().split(\" \"), and then input[1] is m, input[2] is s, input[3] is f. So the first element (input[0]) is not used. That's strange. Maybe it's a mistake in the original code? But I need to replicate that behavior in Fortran.\n\nThe next part reads m lines, each with three integers k, a, b. These are stored in a map where the key is k, and the value is an array list of a and b. Also, maxT is tracked as the maximum k encountered.\n\nThen, the code builds a string of actions. The direction depends on whether s is less than f. The movement is either 'R' (right, incrementing) or 'L' (left, decrementing). The code iterates through time steps from 1 to maxT. At each step, if there's a guard (k exists in the map for current t), check if the current position or next position is blocked. If blocked, append 'X', else move. Once the current time exceeds maxT, continue moving until reaching the destination.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the data structures. The Java code uses a HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>>. In Fortran, we can use an array of structures, perhaps. But since the keys are integers (time steps), and we need to check for each time t whether it exists in the map, perhaps using an array where the index is t, and each element contains a and b. But since the possible t could be up to maxT, which is read from the input, we can dynamically allocate an array of size maxT, or perhaps use a dictionary-like structure. However, Fortran doesn't have built-in hash maps. So perhaps we can pre-process the entries. Since the loop for time t runs from 1 to maxT, and for each t, we check if there's an entry. So in the Java code, multiple entries can have the same k. Wait, no: the loop reads m lines, each line's first integer is k. Then, map.put(k, ...) which replaces any existing entry for k. So for each k in the input, only the last entry (from the m lines) is stored. So for the same k in multiple lines, the last one overwrites the previous.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps create two arrays, a and b, of size maxT. Initially, all entries are set to -1 or some invalid value. Then, for each input line (k, a_val, b_val), we set a(k) = a_val and b(k) = b_val. Then, during the time loop, for each t, if a(t) and b(t) are set (i.e., not -1), then we check the conditions.\n\nBut how to handle the initial case where t might be larger than the maximum k in the input. Wait, the code in Java reads all m lines, each has a k. maxT is the maximum of these k's. So the loop runs from t=1 to maxT. Any t beyond that is handled in the second loop (after maxT).\n\nSo in Fortran, first, we need to process the m entries and track the maximum t (maxT), and create two arrays (a and b) that are indexed from 1 to maxT, where a(t) and b(t) are the values from the input lines. Any t not present in the input lines will have a(t) and b(t) set to some default (like -1, -1).\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the first line: the input variables are m, s, f. Wait, in the Java code, input is split into the first line's tokens. input[1] is m, input[2] is s, input[3] is f. So the first line must have at least four elements? Because input[0], input[1], input[2], input[3]. Wait, maybe the original code's first line is something like \"0 m s f\"? Because otherwise, if the first line is \"m s f\", then input[0] is m, input[1] is s, input[2] is f. But in the code, m is input[1], s is input[2], f is input[3]. So perhaps the original code's first line is actually a line with four numbers, the first of which is ignored. That seems odd, but that's how the code is written.\n\nWait, the first line is read via reader.readLine().split(\" \"), which splits on spaces. The input line could be like \"n m s f\", but the code is using input[1], [2], [3]. So, for example, if the input line is \"4 5 6 7\", then input[0] is \"4\", input[1] is \"5\", input[2] is \"6\", input[3] is \"7\". So m is 5, s is 6, f is7. But in the code's problem statement, perhaps the first number is the number of something else, but in the code, it's not used. So in Fortran, the first line must be read as four integers, and the first is ignored. So in Fortran code, read the first line, split into four parts, take the second, third, fourth as m, s, f.\n\nBut how to read in Fortran. Let's see: in Fortran, we can read the first line as a line of input, then parse the numbers. Alternatively, read using list-directed input. But if the first line has four integers, perhaps.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nread(*,*) dummy, m, s, f\n\nwhere dummy is an integer variable that is read but not used.\n\nThen, read m lines, each with three integers: k, a_val, b_val. For each of these, we need to store a(k) = a_val, b(k) = b_val. Also, track the maximum k as maxT.\n\nThen, the direction is determined based on s < f.\n\nThen, for each time t from 1 to maxT:\n\n- if a(t) and b(t) are present (i.e., were read in the input), check if current position or next position is blocked. If yes, append 'X', else move.\n\nAfter that, continue moving until reaching f.\n\nNow, the first issue is how to store a and b for each possible t. Since the maximum k is maxT, and t runs up to maxT, we can create arrays a and b with size maxT, initialized to some default (like -1, -1). Then, for each input line, set a(k) and b(k) to the values read.\n\nBut in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default, which is okay here since t starts at 1.\n\nBut what if the input lines have k greater than the initial maxT? Wait, no. The Java code reads each m line, and for each, sets k, then updates maxT to be the maximum of current maxT and k. So the final maxT is the maximum k across all input lines.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nInitialize maxT to 0.\n\nThen, for each of the m lines:\n\nread k, a_val, b_val.\n\nif k > maxT, set maxT =k.\n\nthen, store a_val and b_val in a(k) and b(k).\n\nBut in Fortran, how to handle dynamic array sizes. Because the initial a and b arrays need to be up to maxT, but maxT is determined after processing all m lines. So perhaps first read all m lines, collect all k's, find the maximum, then allocate a and b arrays of size maxT, then process the lines again to fill them. But that's not possible if the input is from stdin (since we can't rewind). So perhaps, during the first pass, we can read all the m lines into a list, track the maxT, then allocate a and b arrays, then process the list again to fill the arrays. But that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps read all m lines into a list, and process them to get the maxT first. Then, allocate a and b arrays of size maxT, initialized to -1. Then, process each line again to fill a and b.\n\nBut in Fortran, it's a bit more involved. Since Fortran can't easily handle dynamic arrays unless allocated. So here's the plan:\n\n1. Read the first line: dummy, m, s, f.\n\n2. Read m lines, each into temporary storage (like a list of structures or three separate arrays for k, a_val, b_val). Also, track the maximum k (maxT) during this step.\n\n3. Allocate a and b arrays of size maxT, initialized to -1.\n\n4. Then, for each of the m lines, set a(k) = a_val and b(k) = b_val. If multiple lines have the same k, the last one will overwrite, as in the Java code.\n\nOnce that's done, proceed with the main logic.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: dummy, m, s, f, maxT, i, k, a_val, b_val, t, cur, d, a_block, b_block\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: M\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: actions\n\nThen, read the first line:\n\nread(*,*) dummy, m, s, f\n\nThen, read m lines. To process them, we can use an array to store all the k, a_val, b_val.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be used. So:\n\ntype Guard\n    integer :: k, a, b\nend type Guard\n\ntype(Guard), allocatable :: guards(:)\n\nallocate(guards(m))\n\nmaxT = 0\n\ndo i=1, m\n    read(*,*) guards(i)%k, guards(i)%a, guards(i)%b\n    if (guards(i)%k > maxT) maxT = guards(i)%k\nend do\n\nThen, allocate a and b arrays up to maxT:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n\nallocate(a(maxT), b(maxT))\na = -1\nb = -1\n\ndo i=1, m\n    k = guards(i)%k\n    a(k) = guards(i)%a\n    b(k) = guards(i)%b\nend do\n\nNow, the direction:\n\nif (s < f) then\n    M = 'R'\n    d = 1\nelse\n    M = 'L'\n    d = -1\nend if\n\ncur = s\n\nactions = ''\n\nThen, loop t from 1 to maxT:\n\ndo t = 1, maxT\n    a_block = -1\n    b_block = -1\n    if (t <= maxT) then\n        if (a(t) /= -1) then\n            a_block = a(t)\n            b_block = b(t)\n        end if\n    end if\n    ! check if current position or next is blocked\n    blocked = .false.\n    if (a_block /= -1) then\n        if ( (cur >= a_block .and. cur <= b_block) .or. &\n             (cur + d >= a_block .and. cur + d <= b_block) ) then\n            blocked = .true.\n        end if\n    end if\n    if (blocked) then\n        actions = actions // 'X'\n    else\n        actions = actions // M\n        cur = cur + d\n    end if\n    if (cur == f) exit\nend do\n\nThen, after the loop, if cur is not f, continue appending M until it reaches.\n\ndo while (cur /= f)\n    actions = actions // M\n    cur = cur + d\nend do\n\nFinally, print the actions.\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are a bit tricky. The 'actions' variable needs to be an allocatable character that can be extended. In Fortran 2003 and later, you can use allocatable strings and concatenate using //, but each time it reallocates. For efficiency, perhaps pre-allocate a buffer, but given that the length is unknown, we can proceed with the simple approach.\n\nBut in older Fortran versions, variable-length strings are not easy. However, assuming the code uses modern Fortran features, here's how:\n\nInitialize actions as an empty allocatable string:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: actions\nactions = ''\n\nThen, each time append a character:\n\nactions = actions // 'X'\n\nor similar.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut need to be careful with the array indices. For example, if maxT is zero, but the code reads m lines. Wait, in the Java code, m can be zero? The code reads m lines. So in the Fortran code, when m is zero, the do loop from 1 to m will not execute. So the guards array is allocated with size m=0, but that's allowed in Fortran?\n\nWait, if m is zero, then the loop do i=1, m will not run. So the code would proceed. Then, if maxT is zero, because no lines were read, then when allocating a and b arrays of size maxT (zero?), but Fortran may not allow that. So perhaps need to handle the case when maxT is zero. But in Java code, if m is zero, then maxT remains -1, but the loop for t from 1 to maxT (which is -1) would not run. Then, the code proceeds to append M until reaching f.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, if m is zero, then the code reads m=0 lines, and maxT remains 0. Then, the a and b arrays are allocated with size 0. Then, the loop t from 1 to maxT (which is zero) would not run. Then, the code appends M until cur reaches f.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The direction d is +1 or -1. When s equals f, but in the Java code, the loop will break once cur == f, but in the code, s and f are given as parameters. So if s == f, then the code will output empty string? But according to the problem statement, perhaps s and f are different.\n\nBut in Fortran code, we need to handle all cases. So if s == f, the code would output nothing. But according to the Java code, the loop for t=1 to maxT would run, but cur is already f, so the loop breaks. Then, the code skips adding any actions.\n\nBut perhaps the problem ensures that s != f. But the code should handle it.\n\nAnother thing: in the Java code, when processing each t, if the current position or the next position is blocked, append 'X' and don't move. Else, append M and move.\n\nIn Fortran, the code needs to check if the current t is in the map. But in the Fortran code, a and b arrays are set for t up to maxT. For each t in 1 to maxT, check if a(t) is not -1. If so, check the conditions.\n\nSo, during the loop over t from 1 to maxT:\n\nif a(t) is not -1 (meaning there is a guard at this time), then check if current position is within [a(t), b(t)] or next position (cur +d) is within [a(t), b(t)].\n\nIf either is true, append 'X' and don't move. Else, append M and move.\n\nNow, let's code this in Fortran.\n\nTesting cases:\n\nFor example, if s=2, f=5, direction is R (d=1). At time t=3, a(t)=3, b(t)=4. Current position is 2. Then, next position would be 3. So cur+d=3 is between 3 and4. So blocked. Append 'X'. So movement is stopped.\n\nAnother case: cur is 4, a(t) is 3-5. Then, cur is in the blocked area. So append 'X'.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nAnother possible issue: in Fortran, the '//' operator concatenates strings. But when appending to the 'actions' variable, which is allocatable, each concatenation causes re-allocation. For a long string, this could be inefficient, but given that it's a programming problem, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the complete Fortran code:\n\nFirst, variables and reading input:\n\nprogram codeforces_342_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: dummy, m, s, f, maxT, i, k, a_val, b_val, t, cur, d\n    character(len=1) :: M\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: actions\n    type Guard\n        integer :: k, a, b\n    end type\n    type(Guard), allocatable :: guards(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n    logical :: blocked\n\n    !

Allocate a and b arrays up to maxT\n        if (maxT > 0) then\n            allocate(a(maxT), b(maxT))\n            a = -1\n            b = -1\n            do i = 1, m\n                k = guards(i)%k\n                a(k) = guards(i)%a\n                b(k) = guards(i)%b\n            end do\n        else\n            ! maxT is 0, but m is positive? Not possible since m>0 and each k >=1?\n            ! Assuming input is correct, but handle by allocating zero size arrays.\n            allocate(a(0), b(0))\n        end if\n    else\n        ! No guards, set maxT to 0 and a, b to empty\n        maxT = 0\n        allocate(a(0), b(0))\n    end if\n\n    !

Process time steps up to maxT\n    do t = 1, maxT\n        blocked = .false.\n        if (t <= size(a)) then  ! Ensure t is within the array bounds\n            if (a(t) /= -1) then\n                ! Check current and next position\n                if ((cur >= a(t) .and. cur <= b(t)) .or. &\n                    (cur + d >= a(t) .and. cur + d <= b(t))) then\n                    blocked = .true.\n                end if\n            end if\n        end if\n        if (blocked) then\n            actions = actions // 'X'\n        else\n            actions = actions // M\n            cur = cur + d\n        end if\n        if (cur == f) exit\n    end do\n\n    ! Continue moving until reach f\n    do while (cur /= f)\n        actions = actions // M\n        cur = cur + d\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    print '(a)', actions\n\nend program codeforces_342_B\n\nWait, but in the case where m=0, the a and b arrays are allocated with size 0. Then, in the loop t=1 to maxT (which is zero), the loop doesn't execute. Then, the code appends M until cur reaches f.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother potential issue: when t exceeds the size of a and b arrays (if maxT is zero). But since in the loop t runs from 1 to maxT, which is zero, the loop doesn't run. So no problem.\n\nBut in Fortran, if the loop is written as 'do t=1, maxT', and maxT is zero or negative, the loop does not execute. So that's correct.\n\nAlso, in the code:\n\nif (t <= size(a)) then \n\nBut the size of a is maxT. So for t in 1 to maxT, t <= size(a) is always true. So perhaps that check is redundant. Because during the loop t runs up to maxT, and a is allocated with size maxT. So if maxT is zero, the loop doesn't run. So in that case, the check can be removed.\n\nSo the code can be simplified by removing that condition.\n\nSo the line:\n\nif (a(t) /= -1) then\n\nBecause for t in 1 to maxT, the array a has elements from 1 to maxT. So for each t in that loop, a(t) is either -1 (if not set) or the value from the input.\n\nSo the code can be adjusted as:\n\nblocked = .false.\nif (a(t) /= -1) then\n    ! Check current and next position\n    if ((cur >= a(t) .and. cur <= b(t)) .or. &\n        (cur + d >= a(t) .and. cur + d <= b(t))) then\n        blocked = .true.\n    end if\nend if\n\nBecause for each t in the loop, a(t) is defined (since the array is allocated to maxT, and t is up to maxT). So the check is valid.\n\nSo the code can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThus, the final code would have:\n\ndo t = 1, maxT\n    blocked = .false.\n    if (a(t) /= -1) then\n        if ((cur >= a(t) .and. cur <= b(t)) .or. &\n            (cur + d >= a(t) .and. cur + d <= b(t))) then\n            blocked = .true.\n        end if\n    end if\n    if (blocked) then\n        actions = actions // 'X'\n    else\n        actions = actions // M\n        cur = cur + d\n    end if\n    if (cur == f) exit\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, if maxT is zero, the a array is allocated with size zero. Trying to access a(t) when t >=1 would be out of bounds. So when m is zero, maxT is zero. Then, the loop t=1 to maxT (0) does not execute, so the code doesn't access a and b arrays.\n\nBut when m is zero, the code may not have allocated a and b arrays. Wait, no: in the code, if m>0, then after reading, a and b arrays are allocated. Else (m=0), a and b are allocated as size 0. So even when m=0, a and b are allocated (size 0). So when the loop t=1 to maxT (0) doesn't run, and a and b are of size 0, so accessing a(t) for t=1 would be out of bounds, but the loop does not execute.\n\nThus, the code is safe.\n\nSo the final code should handle all cases correctly."
