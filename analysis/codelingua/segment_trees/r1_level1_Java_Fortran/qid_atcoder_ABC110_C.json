But in the original code, it processes all characters, including spaces. So perhaps the code should loop up to the declared length of the string. But since the declared length is 200000, that's impractical. So perhaps we should use the len_s variable (the length of S and T) as computed earlier. So len_s is the length of S and T (after checking they are equal). So, in the loop for finding the next occurrence:\n\ndo i = start, len_s\n    if (S(i:i) == c) then\n        pos = i\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nSo, the function would loop up to len_s.

But the Java code would fail if the lengths are different. For example, when S is longer than T, T.charAt(sIdx) would throw an exception if sIdx >= T.length(). But in Fortran, if S and T are different lengths, accessing T at sIdx (if sIdx is within the T's length) would be okay, but if sIdx exceeds T's length, then T(sIdx+1) would be a space (since Fortran's strings are fixed-length). So this could lead to incorrect mappings. But given that the problem probably requires S and T to be the same length, perhaps the code should check this first.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads two strings S and T. Then it checks if there's a valid character mapping between S and T such that each character in S maps to exactly one character in T, and vice versa. If such a bijective mapping exists, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, \"No\".\n\nLooking at the Java code: It loops through each character in the alphabet. For each character s in the alphabet, it finds the index of s in S. If s isn't present, it continues. Then, it gets the corresponding character t in T at that index. Then, it checks all occurrences of s in S to see if their positions match the positions of t in T. If any mismatch is found, the result is set to false.\n\nFortran is a bit different. Let's think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, reading the input. In Java, they use Scanner to read lines. In Fortran, we can use READ(*, '(A)') to read the strings.\n\nThen, the alphabet array. In Java, it's a String array of lowercase letters. In Fortran, we can create a character array with each element being a single character.\n\nThe main logic is looping through each character in the alphabet. For each, check if it exists in S. Then, find the corresponding character in T and check the positions.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are 1-indexed, unlike Java's 0-index. So we need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read S and T from input.\n2. Create an array of characters for the alphabet.\n3. Initialize a logical variable 'res' as .TRUE.\n4. Loop through each character in the alphabet array.\n   a. Find the first occurrence of the character in S. If not found, cycle.\n   b. Get the corresponding character in T at that position.\n   c. Check all occurrences in S for this character and see if they match the positions in T for the corresponding character.\n   d. If any discrepancy, set res to .FALSE. and exit loops.\n5. After checking all characters, print \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on res.\n\nNow, the challenge is translating Java's indexOf method. Fortran doesn't have a built-in indexOf, so we'll need to write functions to find the first occurrence and subsequent occurrences.\n\nAlso, since Fortran doesn't have objects, handling strings is a bit different.\n\nLet's start writing the code.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ncharacter(len=200000) :: S, T\ncharacter(len=26) :: A = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\nlogical :: res\ninteger :: i, s_idx, t_idx, idx, pos_in_s, pos_in_t\ninteger :: len_s\n\nRead the input:\n\nread(*, '(a)') S\nread(*, '(a)') T\n\nTrim the strings to get their actual lengths. Wait, but in Java, the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces? The Java code uses nextLine(), which reads the entire line, including spaces. So in Fortran, we need to read the entire line. However, when declaring variables, their lengths are fixed. So maybe we should adjust. Alternatively, use trim to remove trailing spaces, but perhaps the input strings S and T are given each on a line, so we can read them with a format that captures up to the newline. Hmm, in Fortran, when you read with format '(A)', it reads the entire line into the variable, padded with spaces if necessary. So we can read S and T as such, then process them.\n\nBut in the code, we need to know their actual lengths. Wait, in Java, S and T could be of different lengths? But in the problem statement, probably they are the same length. The code uses S.length(), which implies that S and T are the same length. So first, check if len_trim(S) == len_trim(T). But the original code doesn't check that. Wait, in the code, when checking, the loop runs over the indices of S, and when they look for the index in T, they are assuming that T has the same length. So the code probably expects S and T to be the same length. So in Fortran, perhaps we should first check if the lengths are equal, and if not, immediately return \"No\".\n\nBut the original code doesn't do that. Let's see: For example, if S is longer than T, then T.charAt(sIdx) would throw an exception if sIdx is beyond T's length. But in Java, the code reads the entire lines, and when s is present in S, sIdx is the first occurrence. But if T is shorter than S, then T might have a character at sIdx, but not. Wait, but in the problem, S and T are supposed to be of the same length, perhaps. Let's look back at the problem. The original problem (atcoder ABC110 C) is about transforming S into T via a bijective mapping. So S and T must be the same length. So in the Fortran code, perhaps we should first check if their lengths are equal. If not, output \"No\".\n\nBut the original Java code doesn't check that, which could lead to an error. For example, if S is longer than T, then T.charAt(sIdx) would be accessing an index beyond T's length, leading to an exception. But in practice, the problem probably ensures that S and T are of the same length. So in the Fortran code, perhaps we should include that check.\n\nBut since the Java code doesn't do that, maybe we should proceed under the assumption that they are the same length.\n\nBut in any case, in the code, when the program runs, if S and T are different lengths, the code would crash. So to mirror the Java code, perhaps we should not check and just let it run. But in Fortran, if we try to access a character beyond the length of a string, it returns a space. So that could lead to wrong results. Therefore, perhaps in the Fortran code, we should check that the lengths are equal first.\n\nSo adding a check at the beginning:\n\nif (len_trim(S) /= len_trim(T)) then\n    print *, \"No\"\n    stop\nend if\n\nBut wait, len_trim returns the position of the last non-blank character. But in the original code, S and T may have trailing spaces, but in practice, when input via nextLine(), they would include any leading/trailing spaces except the newline. So perhaps in Fortran, we should process the actual length of the strings. But the problem is that when you read with '(A)', the variables S and T are padded with spaces to their declared length. So for example, if the input line is 'abc', then S will be 'abc' followed by 199997 spaces. So when processing, we need to take into account the actual input length.\n\nBut in Java, S is the entire line, including any spaces. So in Fortran, perhaps we need to process the entire string as is. However, in practice, for this problem, the inputs S and T are supposed to consist of lowercase letters only and be the same length. So perhaps the code will be correct if we proceed under the assumption that S and T are of the same length, and that any trailing spaces are part of the input. But that's not the case. So perhaps the correct approach is to trim the leading and trailing spaces. But the original code in Java uses nextLine(), which includes all characters except the newline. So perhaps in Fortran, we should read the entire line, but not trim, and then process up to the actual length of the input.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read a line into a variable of length 200000, the variable will contain the entire line, padded with spaces if the line is shorter than 200000. So if the input lines are, say, 'abc' and 'def', then S will be 'abc' followed by 199997 spaces, and T similarly. But when processing, in the code, the Java code uses S.indexOf(s), which only considers characters up to the actual length of the string, not the declared length. So in Fortran, we need to process the actual input length.\n\nTherefore, perhaps in Fortran, we need to find the actual length of the input strings. How?\n\nIn Fortran, the LEN_TRIM function returns the position of the last non-blank character. So if the input line has trailing spaces, they are considered part of the string. For example, if the input is 'ab c', then the string would be 'ab c' followed by spaces. So len_trim would be 4. But in Java, nextLine() would return the entire line including the space between 'ab' and 'c', but not the trailing spaces (assuming the user didn't input them). Wait, no. If the user inputs a line like 'abc   ' (with trailing spaces), then nextLine() would include those trailing spaces.\n\nSo the Java code treats all characters in the line (including spaces) as part of S and T. So in Fortran, we should process all characters, including spaces. But when the user enters a line, the read statement reads all characters up to the newline, and pads with spaces if the variable's length is longer. So for example, if the variable is declared as length 10 and the input line is 'abc', then the variable will have 'abc' followed by 7 spaces.\n\nBut in the problem's context, S and T are supposed to consist of lowercase letters. But the code handles any characters. So perhaps the code's logic is correct regardless of the input characters.\n\nBut for the Fortran code, we need to process the entire S and T, but the problem is that when S and T are read into variables of length 200000, and the actual input is shorter, the rest is filled with spaces. So when checking the positions, those spaces are part of the strings.\n\nBut in Java, the code processes the entire string, including any trailing spaces. So perhaps in Fortran, we should process all characters up to the declared length. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can find the actual length of each string (number of characters up to the first newline, but Fortran's read with '(A)' captures the entire line, including spaces, but not the newline). So the actual length of the string as per input is the number of characters read. But Fortran doesn't track that. So when reading into a fixed-length character variable, the variable will have leading characters up to the input line's length, followed by spaces. So if the input line is 'abc', then the variable will have 'abc' followed by spaces. So when checking for occurrences of 'a' in S, the code will check all positions, including those spaces. But in Java, the code's S is exactly the input line, which could include trailing spaces if entered. But the problem's test cases probably don't include such cases. So perhaps in the Fortran code, we can process the entire declared length (200000), but that's impractical. Alternatively, find the actual length by checking where the first newline or null is, but in Fortran, that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the LEN_TRIM function. But that would ignore trailing spaces, which might not be desired. But according to the problem's context, the input strings probably don't have trailing spaces, so using LEN_TRIM to get the effective length is acceptable. But this depends on the problem's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, proceed without trimming and process all 200000 characters. But that's inefficient. However, the problem's test cases likely have strings of manageable lengths. So perhaps in the Fortran code, we can process all characters up to the length of the input strings. To get the actual length, we can use LEN_TRIM(S) and LEN_TRIM(T). But if the input strings contain spaces, len_trim would not account for trailing spaces beyond the last non-space character. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nBut given that the Java code processes the entire string, including any spaces, the Fortran code should do the same. However, in practice, the problem's test cases probably don't include spaces. So perhaps the code can proceed under the assumption that the inputs are all lowercase letters with no spaces. But to mirror the Java code accurately, we need to process all characters in the strings, including spaces.\n\nBut given the variables are declared as length 200000, and the code uses S.indexOf(s), which returns the first occurrence of the character, regardless of position. So in Fortran, when processing the strings, we need to loop through each character position from 1 to the actual length of the strings.\n\nBut how to determine the actual length of S and T in Fortran? Since the code reads the entire line, but the Fortran variables are padded with spaces, the actual input length is len_trim(S), assuming that the input doesn't have trailing spaces. But if the input does have trailing spaces, len_trim would give the index of the last non-space character, but the actual input includes those spaces. For example, input line 'ab ' (with a space at the end) would be stored as 'ab ' followed by spaces. len_trim(S) would be 2 in this case, but the actual input length (as per Java) would be 3. So the code would miss processing the third character. Therefore, to accurately mirror the Java code, we need to process all characters up to the declared length, but that's 200000, which is impractical. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the length of the input line. However, Fortran doesn't track this. One approach is to read each line into a buffer and find the actual length. But that's complicated. Alternatively, since the problem probably expects S and T to be the same length, and the code processes each position, perhaps the code can process up to the maximum of len_trim(S) and len_trim(T). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can assume that S and T are of the same length and use that length. Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nlen_s = len_trim(S)\nif (len_s /= len_trim(T)) then\n    print *, \"No\"\n    stop\nend if\n\nBut the Java code doesn't check this. So perhaps we should not include this check. But the Java code would fail if the lengths are different. For example, when S is longer than T, T.charAt(sIdx) would throw an exception if sIdx >= T.length(). But in Fortran, if S and T are different lengths, accessing T at sIdx (if sIdx is within the T's length) would be okay, but if sIdx exceeds T's length, then T(sIdx+1) would be a space (since Fortran's strings are fixed-length). So this could lead to incorrect mappings.\n\nBut given that the problem probably requires S and T to be the same length, perhaps the code should check this first. The original Java code may have assumed that the input lines are of the same length. So adding the check in Fortran is a good idea.\n\nSo let's add:\n\nlen_s = len_trim(S)\nif (len_s /= len_trim(T)) then\n    res = .false.\nelse\n    res = .true.\n    ! proceed with checks\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, if S and T are different lengths, then when processing characters in S that are beyond the length of T, T.charAt(sIdx) would throw an exception. But in practice, the code would crash. So in the Fortran code, to mirror that, perhaps the code should proceed only if len_s is the same. Otherwise, output \"No\".\n\nSo, first, check if len_trim(S) == len_trim(T). If not, set res to .false. and skip the processing. Else, proceed.\n\nSo that's an additional check that's not in the Java code. But it's necessary to prevent invalid accesses. So perhaps it's better to include it.\n\nNow, for each character in the alphabet array:\n\nLoop over each character in A. For each character s:\n\nFind the first occurrence in S. In Java, indexOf(s). In Fortran, we need to write a function to find the first occurrence.\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have a built-in function for that. So we need to loop through each character in S and find the first occurrence.\n\nSo:\n\ns_idx = 0\ndo i = 1, len_s\n    if (S(i:i) == s) then\n        s_idx = i\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nIf s_idx is 0, then s is not in S, so cycle the loop.\n\nThen, the corresponding character t is T(s_idx:s_idx).\n\nBut if s_idx exceeds the length of T, then this would be invalid. But we already checked len_trim(S) == len_trim(T), so s_idx is <= len_s, which equals len_trim(T). So T(s_idx:s_idx) is valid.\n\nThen, for the current s and t, we need to check that every occurrence of s in S corresponds to t in T, and every occurrence of t in T corresponds to s in S.\n\nWait, no. The original code checks that in S, every occurrence of s is at the same position where t appears in T, and vice versa? Or is it checking that each occurrence of s in S is matched by t in T at the same position, and that there are no extra t's in T at other positions.\n\nThe Java code's logic is:\n\nFor each character s in the alphabet:\n\n   find the first occurrence sIdx in S.\n\n   if none, continue.\n\n   t is the character at sIdx in T.\n\n   then, check all positions in S where s occurs. For each such position idx:\n\n       check that in S, the index of s starting from idx is the same as the index of t starting from idx in T.\n\n   Also, check that there are no occurrences of t in T beyond the current positions.\n\nWait, the code does:\n\nIn the while loop:\n\n   while (idx < S.length()) {\n\n       if (S.indexOf(s, idx) >=0) {\n\n           if (S.indexOf(s, idx) != T.indexOf(t, idx)) --> res=false.\n\n           else, idx is updated to S.indexOf(s, idx) +1.\n\n       } else if (T.indexOf(t, idx) >=0) --> res = false.\n\n       else break.\n\n   }\n\nSo this checks that every occurrence of s in S from idx onwards is at the same position as t in T. Also, after all occurrences of s in S are processed, if there are any occurrences of t in T beyond that, it's invalid.\n\nThis ensures that all occurrences of s in S map to t in T, and all occurrences of t in T are mapped to by s in S.\n\nSo the mapping must be bijective.\n\nNow, in Fortran, we need to replicate this logic.\n\nSo for each s in A:\n\n   find the first occurrence in S. If none, skip.\n\n   t = T at that position.\n\n   then, check all positions in S:\n\n       for idx starting from 1 to len_s:\n\n           find the next occurrence of s in S starting from idx.\n\n           if found, check if T has t at that position.\n\n               also, check if the next occurrence of t in T starting from idx is at the same position.\n\n           if not found, check if there are any occurrences of t in T starting from idx. If yes, invalid.\n\nSo this is a bit complex.\n\nLet's try to implement the while loop logic.\n\nIn the Java code, idx starts at 0 (Java is 0-indexed), and for each iteration:\n\nIf S has s starting at idx, then check if T has t at the same position.\n\nIf not, res is false.\n\nElse, idx is set to the next position after the found index.\n\nIf S doesn't have s starting at idx, then check if T has t starting at idx. If yes, res is false.\n\nElse, break.\n\nSo translating this to Fortran's 1-indexing.\n\nWe can implement this with a loop over idx starting at 1.\n\nBut the logic is:\n\ninitialize idx = 1.\n\nloop:\n\n   find the next occurrence of s in S starting from idx.\n\n   if found:\n\n       find the position in S: pos_in_s.\n\n       find the next occurrence of t in T starting from idx: pos_in_t.\n\n       if pos_in_s /= pos_in_t --> res is false, exit.\n\n       else, set idx to pos_in_s +1.\n\n   else:\n\n       check if there's any occurrence of t in T starting from idx.\n\n       if yes --> res is false, exit.\n\n       else: break.\n\nContinue until idx exceeds len_s.\n\nSo how to find the next occurrence of a character in a string starting from a given index.\n\nImplement functions to find the next occurrence.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can write a function:\n\nfunction find_next_char(str, start, c) result(pos)\n    character(*), intent(in) :: str\n    integer, intent(in) :: start\n    character, intent(in) :: c\n    integer :: pos\n\n    pos = 0\n    do i = start, len_trim(str)\n        if (str(i:i) == c) then\n            pos = i\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\nend function\n\nWait, but the original code uses S.indexOf(s, idx), which returns the first occurrence of s at or after idx. In Fortran, starting from idx (1-based), check each character.\n\nBut in the code, the loop runs from start to len_trim(str). But if the string has trailing spaces beyond the actual input, then len_trim(str) would be the index of the last non-blank character. But in the original code, it processes all characters, including spaces. So perhaps the code should loop up to the declared length of the string. But since the declared length is 200000, that's impractical. So perhaps we should use the len_s variable (the length of S and T) as computed earlier.\n\nSo len_s is the length of S and T (after checking they are equal). So, in the loop for finding the next occurrence:\n\ndo i = start, len_s\n    if (S(i:i) == c) then\n        pos = i\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nSo, the function would loop up to len_s.\n\nBut since functions in Fortran can't have variables from the parent scope, perhaps we need to pass len_s as a parameter.\n\nAlternatively, avoid using functions and inline the code.\n\nBut for readability, perhaps writing functions is better. However, Fortran's function handling can be a bit cumbersome.\n\nAlternatively, implement the find next occurrence inline.\n\nFor example:\n\npos_in_s = 0\ndo i = idx, len_s\n    if (S(i:i) == s) then\n        pos_in_s = i\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nSimilarly for pos_in_t.\n\nThen, proceed as per Java's logic.\n\nSo, let's outline the code for each s in A:\n\ndo i = 1, 26\n    s = A(i:i)\n    ! Find first occurrence of s in S\n    s_idx = 0\n    do j = 1, len_s\n        if (S(j:j) == s) then\n            s_idx = j\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (s_idx == 0) cycle\n\n    t = T(s_idx:s_idx)\n\n    idx = 1\n    do while (idx <= len_s)\n        ! Find next occurrence of s in S starting from idx\n        pos_in_s = 0\n        do j = idx, len_s\n            if (S(j:j) == s) then\n                pos_in_s = j\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        if (pos_in_s /= 0) then\n            ! Check if T has t at pos_in_s\n            if (T(pos_in_s:pos_in_s) /= t) then\n                res = .false.\n                exit\n            end if\n\n            ! Also, check if the next occurrence of t in T starting from idx is the same as pos_in_s\n            pos_in_t = 0\n            do j = idx, len_s\n                if (T(j:j) == t) then\n                    pos_in_t = j\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (pos_in_s /= pos_in_t) then\n                res = .false.\n                exit\n            end if\n\n            idx = pos_in_s + 1\n        else\n            ! Check if there are any occurrences of t in T starting from idx\n            pos_in_t = 0\n            do j = idx, len_s\n                if (T(j:j) == t) then\n                    pos_in_t = j\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (pos_in_t /= 0) then\n                res = .false.\n                exit\n            else\n                exit\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (.not. res) exit\nend do\n\nWait, but this might not exactly replicate the Java logic. Let me re-examine the Java code's loop.\n\nJava code:\n\nwhile (idx < S.length()) {\n    if (S.indexOf(s, idx) >=0) {\n        if (S.indexOf(s, idx) != T.indexOf(t, idx)) {\n            res = false;\n            break;\n        } else {\n            idx = S.indexOf(s, idx) + 1;\n        }\n    } else if (T.indexOf(t, idx) >=0) {\n        res = false;\n        break;\n    } else {\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nSo, in each iteration of the while loop:\n\nCheck if s occurs in S starting from idx. If yes:\n\n   Check if the index of s in S is equal to the index of t in T starting from idx. If not, invalid.\n\n   Then, move idx to the next position after the found index.\n\nElse:\n\n   Check if t occurs in T starting from idx. If yes, invalid.\n\n   Else, break.\n\nSo, the key is that for every occurrence of s in S, the corresponding position in T must have t, and every occurrence of t in T must be matched by an occurrence of s in S.\n\nBut the code checks this by ensuring that when you look for s in S starting at idx, and look for t in T starting at idx, their positions are the same. If they are, then proceed to the next idx. If not, invalid.\n\nIf s is not found in S from idx onwards, then check if t is found in T from idx onwards. If yes, then invalid. Because that would mean there's a t in T that's not mapped to by an s in S.\n\nSo, to implement this in Fortran:\n\nFor each s in A:\n\n   if s not in S, continue.\n\n   t = T(s_idx)\n\n   idx = 1\n\n   do while (idx <= len_s)\n\n       find pos_in_s = first occurrence of s in S >= idx.\n\n       if pos_in_s found:\n\n           find pos_in_t = first occurrence of t in T >= idx.\n\n           if pos_in_s /= pos_in_t --> invalid.\n\n           idx = pos_in_s + 1\n\n       else:\n\n           find pos_in_t = first occurrence of t in T >= idx.\n\n           if pos_in_t found --> invalid.\n\n           else: exit loop.\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\nSo this is the correct logic.\n\nSo the Fortran code for this part would be:\n\nidx = 1\ndo while (idx <= len_s)\n    ! Find pos_in_s in S starting from idx\n    pos_in_s = 0\n    do j = idx, len_s\n        if (S(j:j) == s) then\n            pos_in_s = j\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (pos_in_s /= 0) then\n        !

However, this approach may miss checking for characters in T that are not mapped from any s in S. For example, suppose there's a character in T that is not mapped by any character in S, but is mapped by another character in S. The original code might not catch this because it's only looping through s in S's characters.\n\nWait, the original Java code loops through each character in the alphabet (a-z), not just those present in S. For each character s in the alphabet, if it's present in S, then it checks the mapping. For characters not in S, the code skips them. However, what about characters in T that are not mapped to by any s in S? Because the code only checks that for each s in S, their t is mapped correctly, but doesn't check that every t in T is mapped back to some s in S. \n\nBut in the code's logic, when processing s in the alphabet, for each occurrence of s in S, it also checks that the corresponding t in T is not present elsewhere except where s is present. For example, after processing all occurrences of s in S, the code checks that there are no remaining occurrences of t in T beyond those mapped to s. But this may not cover all possibilities.\n\nBut perhaps the original code's logic is correct. Let's think of an example where the mapping is not bijective.\n\nFor example:\n\nS = \"aba\", T = \"baa\".\n\nThen, the code would process each character in the alphabet.\n\nFor s = 'a':\n\nfirst occurrence is at index 0 (Java) / 1 (Fortran). t is T[1] = 'b'.\n\nThen, for idx=0 (Java), find the occurrence of 'a' starting at 0. It's 0. Check T's occurrence of 'b' starting at 0. It's 0. So okay. idx becomes 1.\n\nNext, find 'a' starting at 1. In S, it's at 2. Check T's occurrence of 'b' starting at 1. T[1] is 'a', so the occurrence of 'b' would be not found. So pos_in_t is 0. So pos_in_s (2) is not equal to pos_in_t (0). So res becomes false.\n\nBut wait, in this example, the code would correctly detect that 'a' in S maps to 'b' in T, but the second 'a' in S is at position 2, which in T is 'a', which doesn't match 'b'.\n\nSo the code would output \"No\".\n\nBut in reality, the mapping isn't bijective. The original code would catch this.\n\nThus, the code's logic seems correct.\n\nIn the Fortran code, by processing each character in the alphabet and checking the correspondence, the code should cover all possible mappings.\n\nHowever, there's a possible flaw: if a character t in T is mapped to by multiple s's in S. For example, if s1 and s2 in S both map to t. The original code would not catch this, because when processing s1, it would check that all occurrences of s1 in S map to t, but when processing s2, it would check that all occurrences of s2 in S map to their corresponding t' (which may be the same t as s1's). But this would result in a conflict.\n\nFor example, S = \"ab\", T = \"aa\".\n\nThen, for s = 'a' in S:\n\nt would be T[0] = 'a'. The code checks that all 'a's in S map to 'a's in T. That's true. Then, when processing 'b' in S, t would be T[1] = 'a'. The code would check that all 'b's in S (position 1) have T's character 'a' at that position. Then, in the while loop for s='b', when checking for occurrences of 'b' in S starting at idx=1, it finds position 1. Then checks if T's occurrence of 'a' starting at 1 is also position 1. It is. Then, idx becomes 2, exit loop. Then, when processing 'b's, it's okay. But then, the code would output \"Yes\", but the actual mapping is not bijective because 'a' in T is mapped to both 'a' and 'b' in S.\n\nAh, this is a problem. The original code's logic is flawed in this case. Because when processing s='a', it checks that all 'a's in S map to 'a's in T, but it doesn't check that no other characters in S also map to 'a's in T. So the code would incorrectly output \"Yes\" for S=\"ab\" and T=\"aa\".\n\nThis suggests that the Java code is incorrect. However, the problem at hand (ABC110 C) requires a bijective mapping. So the code may not handle this case correctly.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the correct answer for S=\"ab\" and T=\"aa\" should be \"No\", since 'a' and 'b' both map to 'a' in T, which is not allowed.\n\nSo the original Java code is incorrect, and thus the Fortran code translated directly would also be incorrect.\n\nBut given that the user wants to translate the Java code to Fortran, regardless of correctness, we need to replicate the logic, even if it's wrong.\n\nSo the translated code will mirror the Java code's logic, including its potential flaws.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code as written earlier is correct in terms of translation, even if the logic has issues.\n\nNow, testing the code with the example S=\"ab\", T=\"aa\".\n\nIn the code:\n\nlen_s = len_trim(S) = 2.\n\nProcessing each character in A:\n\nFor 'a':\n\ns_idx = 1 (position of 'a' in S). t = T(1:1) = 'a'.\n\nThen, in the while loop:\n\nidx starts at 1.\n\npos_in_s is 1 (since S(1) is 'a').\n\npos_in_t is first occurrence of 'a' in T starting at 1, which is 1.\n\npos_in_s == pos_in_t, so idx becomes 2.\n\nNow, idx is 2 <= 2.\n\nfind pos_in_s starting from 2: S(2) is 'b', not 'a', so pos_in_s is 0.\n\nThen, check for pos_in_t in T starting from 2. T has length 2, so j=2: T(2:2) is 'a' (if T is \"aa\", then T(2) is 'a'). So pos_in_t is 2.\n\nThus, in the else clause, pos_in_t is 2 != 0. So res becomes false. Exit loop.\n\nBut wait, the code would set res to false here.\n\nWait, let's walk through the code for this case.\n\nFor s = 'a', t = 'a'.\n\nProcessing the while loop:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nidx = 1.\n\npos_in_s = 1.\n\npos_in_t = 1.\n\nOK. idx becomes 2.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nidx = 2.\n\npos_in_s: check S(2:2) which is 'b' != 'a'. So pos_in_s is 0.\n\nNow, check T for 'a' starting at 2. T is \"aa\", len_s=2. So j runs from 2 to 2. T(2) is 'a'. So pos_in_t=2.\n\nThus, in the else clause, pos_in_t is 2, so res becomes false. Exit loop.\n\nThus, res is false. The code outputs \"No\", which is correct.\n\nWait, but in this example, S is \"ab\", T is \"aa\". The code would output \"No\"?\n\nBut according to the Java code's logic, when processing s='a', it checks that all 'a's in S (position 1) are mapped to 'a's in T. Then, when idx is 2, it checks if there are any 'a's in T starting at 2. T is \"aa\", so position 2 is 'a', which exists. Thus, the code sets res to false.\n\nSo the code correctly outputs \"No\" for this case.\n\nAnother example: S = \"ab\", T = \"ba\". This is a valid bijective mapping.\n\nProcessing s='a':\n\ns_idx=1. t = T(1) = 'b'.\n\nThen, in the while loop:\n\nidx=1.\n\npos_in_s=1.\n\nCheck T for 'b' starting at 1: T(1) is 'a', so pos_in_t=0. So pos_in_s (1) != pos_in_t (0) --> res=false. Exit loop.\n\nSo code outputs \"No\", which is wrong.\n\nWait, but this example is a valid swap of a and b. The correct answer should be \"Yes\".\n\nWait, what's wrong here?\n\nLet me re-examine the code's logic.\n\nIn this case, S is \"ab\", T is \"ba\".\n\nProcessing s='a' in S:\n\ns_idx =1. t = T(1:1) = 'b'.\n\nThen, idx=1.\n\nFind pos_in_s (s='a') starting at 1: 1.\n\nFind pos_in_t (t='b') starting at 1: in T=\"ba\", the first occurrence of 'b' at 1 is position 1. So pos_in_t=1.\n\nSo pos_in_s == pos_in_t. idx becomes 2.\n\nNow, in the next iteration, idx=2.\n\npos_in_s (s='a') starting at 2: not found. pos_in_s=0.\n\nCheck T for 'b' starting at 2: T has length 2. T(2:2) is 'a', so no. pos_in_t=0. So exit loop.\n\nThus, res remains true.\n\nNext, processing s='b' in S.\n\ns_idx =2. t = T(2:2) = 'a'.\n\nThen, in the while loop:\n\nidx=1.\n\nFind pos_in_s (s='b') starting at 1: in S, position 2. pos_in_s=2.\n\nCheck T for 'a' starting at 1: first occurrence is 2. So pos_in_t=2.\n\npos_in_s == pos_in_t. idx becomes 3.\n\nNow, idx=3 > len_s (2), exit loop.\n\nThus, res remains true.\n\nThus, the code would output \"Yes\", which is correct.\n\nHmm, but earlier when processing s='a', the code works correctly.\n\nSo perhaps the code is correct.\n\nBut in the earlier example where S=\"ab\", T=\"ba\", the code works correctly.\n\nAnother test case: S=\"abc\", T=\"bca\". Expected output \"Yes\".\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nFor s='a' in S, t='b'.\n\nCheck all occurrences of 'a' in S (position 1) correspond to 'b' in T. Then check if there are any 'b's in T beyond that. \n\nBut I think the code would correctly handle this.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code as written should correctly translate the Java code's logic.\n\nNow, handling the case where the input strings have different lengths.\n\nIf S is \"a\" and T is \"aa\", then len_trim(S) =1, len_trim(T) =2. The code sets res to false and outputs \"No\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be correct.\n\nThe only thing left is to handle the variable declarations properly. For example, the variables S and T are declared with length 200000. But when processing, we use len_s = len_trim(S). However, if the input strings have trailing spaces, len_trim will give the index of the last non-blank character, but the code may miss trailing spaces in the input. But according to the problem statement, the inputs are supposed to be lowercase letters, so trailing spaces are unlikely. So the code should be correct.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code is as written earlier."
