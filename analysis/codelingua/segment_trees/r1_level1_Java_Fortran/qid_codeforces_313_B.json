So cum(i) represents the total number of pairs up to and including the i-th pair (i.e., up to (i, i+1)). But in the Java code, for the query l to r (after decrementing r by 1), the answer is cum[r] - cum[l-1]. So in the Java code, if the query is l=2, r=3 (after adjustment), then it's the sum from l-1 (1) to r (3). So cum[3] - cum[1-1=0]. But in Fortran's cum array, the indices would correspond to the pairs. Let's see. For example, if the string is \"aabb\", len_s=4. Then the pairs are (1,2) (equal), (2,3) (not), (3,4) (equal). So cum(1) = 1, cum(2)=1, cum(3)=2. cum(4) =0. So for a query l=1, r=4 (original), in Java r becomes 3. So answer is cum(3) - cum(0) = 2-0=2. Which is correct. In Fortran, the same query would have l=1, r=4. Then the code would set r = r-1 =3, then compute cum(r) - cum(l-1). So cum(3) - cum(0) = 2-0=2. Which matches. So the logic is correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nSo the main class reads from standard input and writes to standard output using BufferedReader and PrintWriter. The Fast class handles the logic. The sol method processes the input string and computes a cumulative array. Then, for each query, it calculates the difference between two positions in the cumulative array.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how Fortran handles input and output. Java's BufferedReader and StringTokenizer are used here to read lines and split them into tokens. In Fortran, I'll have to read from the console using READ statements and parse the input manually. \n\nThe cumulative array 'cum' in Java is of size s.length()+1. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but I can adjust indices accordingly. The loop for building the cumulative array starts from index 1 (Java's 0-based) to s.length()-1. Wait, the Java code initializes cum[0] and cum[s.length()] as 0. Wait, no, looking at the Java code: 'cum' is declared as new Integer[s.length() + 1], so the indices go from 0 to s.length(). Then cum[0] and cum[s.length()] are set to 0. But the loop runs for i from 1 to s.length()-1. Hmm, maybe the code has a typo here. Let me check again.\n\nIn the Java code, after creating cum with size s.length() +1, the code does cum[0] = cum[s.length()] = 0. Then the loop is for (i=1; i < s.length(); i++). So for a string of length N, the cum array is size N+1. For i from 1 to N-1 (since i < s.length()). So for each character in the string (since s is 0-based in Java, indices 0 to N-1). Wait, the string length is, say, L. Then the loop runs i from 1 to L-1. So for each i in 1 to L-1, check if s[i] == s[i-1], then add to cum[i]. But the cum array's size is L+1. Hmm, perhaps the original code is a bit confusing. Let me see.\n\nIn the Java code, the cumulative array is built such that cum[i] holds the count of consecutive equal characters up to position i-1. For example, for the string \"aabb\", the cum array would track how many times s[j] == s[j-1] up to j = i-1. Then, for each query [l, r], it returns cum[r-1] - cum[l-1-1], maybe? Wait, the code has l and r being parsed as the input, then r is decremented by 1. Then the answer is cum[r] - cum[l-1]. So if the original query is from l to r (inclusive?), but in the code, r is replaced with r-1, so the interval in the string is from l to r-1. Wait, perhaps the problem's queries are 1-based and refer to positions in the string. So for the string s, each query is a range from l to r, but the code subtracts 1 from r. Wait, the original code's line: Integer l = ... , r = ... -1. Then the answer is cum[r] - cum[l-1]. So perhaps the cumulative array is set up such that cum[i] represents the number of matches up to position i-1. Or maybe the cumulative array is computed in a way that for each i, it's the sum up to i (0-based). Let me think.\n\nThe Java code's cumulative array is initialized with cum[0] = 0. Then, for each i from 1 to s.length()-1 (assuming the loop is up to s.length() -1?), wait, no. Let's see: the loop is for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++). So for a string of length N (s.length() = N), the loop runs i from 1 to N-1. So for each i in 1..N-1. Then, cum[i] is calculated based on whether s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i-1). If so, cum[i] = cum[i-1] +1, else same as before. So the cumulative array cum[0..N] (since the array is of size N+1). But the code initializes cum[0] and cum[N] to 0. Wait, no: in Java, cum is new Integer[N+1], which creates an array of size N+1, indexes 0 to N. Then cum[0] and cum[N] are set to 0. Then for i from 1 to N-1 (since i < s.length()), the code checks s[i] and s[i-1]. For each i, cum[i] is either previous +1 or same.\n\nSo cum[i] holds the count of pairs (s[j], s[j-1]) that are equal, for j from 0 to i-1. Because for i=1, it checks s[0] and s[1], and adds 1 if they are equal. Wait, no: when i is 1, s.charAt(i) is s[1], s[i-1] is s[0]. So if they are equal, cum[1] = cum[0] +1. So cum[i] represents the number of equal adjacent pairs up to position i-1. Because for each i, we're considering the pair (i-1, i). Then, for i from 1 to N-1, each pair (0-1, 1-2, ..., (N-2)-(N-1)). So the cumulative array up to i = N-1 (the last index of the loop) would include all pairs in the string. Then, cum[N] is set to 0. But in the loop, when i is N-1 (the last iteration), then the code checks s[N-1] vs s[N-2], and cum[N-1] is calculated. Then cum[N] remains 0.\n\nThen, for a query l and r (original, before r is decremented by 1), the code subtracts 1 from r, making it r-1, and then the answer is cum[r] - cum[l-1]. So the interval [l, r] in the query (original) becomes [l, r-1], but how does this translate to the cumulative array?\n\nWait, the original query may be from position l to r (1-based?), and the answer is the number of consecutive equal pairs in that range. For example, if the string is a a b b, the consecutive pairs are (1,2) and (3,4). So for l=1, r=4, the answer is 2. But according to the code, when the query is processed, r is set to r-1 (so 4-1=3), and then the answer is cum[3] - cum[0]. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"aabb\", which has length 4. The loop runs i from 1 to 3 (since i < 4). For i=1, compare s[1] and s[0], which are 'a' and 'a' \u2192 cum[1] = 1. For i=2, compare s[2] ('b') and s[1] ('a') \u2192 no, cum[2] =1. For i=3, compare s[3] ('b') and s[2] ('b') \u2192 yes, cum[3] = 2. Then cum[4] is 0.\n\nSo for query l=1 and r=4 (original), r becomes 3. The answer is cum[3] - cum[0] \u2192 2-0=2, which is correct. Another example: l=1, r=2 (original). Then r becomes 1. The answer is cum[1] - cum[0] \u21921-0=1. Which counts the first pair. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input string.\n2. Compute the cumulative array.\n3. Read the number of queries.\n4. For each query, read l and r, compute r-1, then output cum[r] - cum[l-1].\n\nFortran's strings are 1-based, but the original code uses 0-based indices. So when translating, need to adjust indices. Let me think.\n\nIn Java, the string is 0-based. The loop for i from 1 to s.length()-1 (exclusive). So for a string of length L, i runs from 1 to L-1 (so L-1 times). For each i, check s[i] vs s[i-1]. In Fortran, if the string is stored as a 1-based array, then the same check would be for characters at positions i and i-1. So for i from 2 to L (since in Fortran, the loop would run from 2 to L, but since in the Java code, i ranges from 1 to L-1 (Java's indices), which corresponds to the pairs (0,1), (1,2), ..., (L-2, L-1) in the string. In Fortran, if the string is 1-based, then the pairs are (1,2), (2,3), ..., (L-1, L). Wait, the original code's loop runs for i from 1 to s.length()-1. So for a string of length 4, i runs 1,2,3. Each i corresponds to the pair (i-1, i) in Java's 0-based string. So in Fortran's 1-based, that would be (i, i+1). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.\n\nJava's s is 0-based. For i=1, s[i] is s[1], s[i-1] is s[0]. So in Fortran, the same pairs would be (1,2), (2,3), etc., if the Fortran string is 1-based. So in Fortran, for each position j from 2 to L, we can check s(j-1) and s(j). Because j starts at 2, then j-1 is 1, j is 2. So that's the first pair. So the loop in Fortran would run from j=2 to L. For each j, check if s(j-1) == s(j). Then, the cumulative array can be built.\n\nSo in the Java code, the cum array has size L+1 (since s.length() is L). For example, for L=4, indexes 0 to 4. In Fortran, the array can be dimension(0:L), with 0-based or 1-based. But Fortran's default is 1-based, but you can specify the index. So perhaps declare cum(0:L), where L is the length of the string.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if we have a character variable declared as, say, character(len=100) :: s, then s(1:1) is the first character, s(2:2) the second, etc. So the string is 1-based.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the input string. In Fortran, reading a line can be done with read(*,'(A)') s. But need to adjust the length. Alternatively, read the entire line, but in Fortran, the length is fixed once declared. So perhaps read the line into a sufficiently long variable.\n\nBut in the Java code, the first input line is the string. Then the next line is the number of queries, then each query is a line with two integers.\n\nSo in Fortran, first read the string. Then read the number of queries. Then for each query, read l and r.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading from standard input can be done using read(*,*) variables. But for reading lines, sometimes you have to read the entire line and parse it. For example, to read the string, perhaps read a line into a variable. Then, read the next line as the number of queries. Then for each query, read a line and parse l and r.\n\nSo for the string, let's assume that the maximum length is 1000 or something. So declare a character array of size 1000, then read the input line into it.\n\nBut how to handle dynamic lengths? Well, the problem probably expects that the code can handle any length up to a certain maximum, but in Fortran, fixed-length strings are common. So let's proceed with that.\n\nSo code steps:\n\n- Read the input string. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(100000) :: s\ninteger :: len_s\n\nread(*,'(A)') s\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nBut len_trim gives the length without trailing spaces. So this will get the actual length of the input string.\n\nThen, build the cumulative array. Declare cum as an array of integers, with indexes from 0 to len_s.\n\ninteger, dimension(0:100000) :: cum  ! Assuming max string length is 100000.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be used, but for simplicity, perhaps declare a large enough array. Alternatively, use allocatable arrays.\n\nBut in practice, it's better to use allocatable arrays. So:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: cum(:)\n...\nallocate(cum(0:len_s))\ncum(0) = 0\ncum(len_s) = 0  ! Wait, len_s is the actual length. The original code sets cum[s.length()] = 0. But in Java, the array is of size s.length() +1, so cum[s.length()] is the last element. So in Fortran, if len_s is the length of the string, then the cum array should be 0 to len_s. Because in Java, the array is new Integer[s.length() +1], so indexes 0 to s.length(). So in Fortran, cum(0:len_s) is correct.\n\nWait, no. s.length() in Java is the length of the string. The cum array is of size s.length()+1, so indexes 0 to s.length(). For example, if the string length is 4, cum has indexes 0-4 (5 elements). So in Fortran, cum would be declared as (0:len_s), where len_s is the length of the string.\n\nThen, the loop runs for i from 1 to len_s-1 (because in Java code, i < s.length(), which is len_s in Java). So in Fortran, the loop is i=1 to len_s-1.\n\nFor each i in 1 to len_s-1:\n\nif (s(i) == s(i-1)) then\n    cum(i) = cum(i-1) + 1\nelse\n    cum(i) = cum(i-1)\nend if\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Java, for i from 1 to len_s-1 (Java's i < s.length() is equivalent to i < len_s). So in Fortran, for a string of length len_s, the loop would be from i=1 to len_s-1. But in Fortran, the string is 1-based. So the code's check is s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i-1). For Java's i (loop variable), the characters are s[i] and s[i-1]. In Fortran, since the string is 1-based, the corresponding positions would be i and i+1? Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nWait, Java's i runs from 1 to len_s-1. For each i, the code checks s[i] and s[i-1]. So in the Java code, the loop processes the pairs (0,1), (1,2), ..., (len_s-2, len_s-1). These are all consecutive pairs in the string. So for the string of length len_s, there are len_s-1 possible pairs.\n\nIn Fortran, the string is 1-based. So the first pair is s(1) and s(2), then s(2) and s(3), etc. So to process all possible consecutive pairs, the loop in Fortran should run from i=1 to len_s-1. For each i, check s(i) == s(i+1). Wait, no. For i in 1 to len_s-1, s(i) and s(i+1) form the pair. Then, for each such pair, if they are equal, we add 1 to the cumulative sum.\n\nSo the cumulative array in Fortran should be built as follows:\n\ncum(0) = 0\ndo i = 1, len_s-1\n    if (s(i:i) == s(i+1:i+1)) then\n        cum(i) = cum(i-1) + 1\n    else\n        cum(i) = cum(i-1)\n    end if\nend do\ncum(len_s) = 0\n\nWait, but the Java code's cum array is from 0 to len_s (inclusive). So in Fortran, the cum array is 0:len_s. The Java code initializes cum[0] and cum[len_s] to 0. Then, for i from 1 to len_s-1, it sets cum[i] based on the previous value. Then, cum[len_s] remains 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, after building the cum array from 1 to len_s-1, the cum(len_s) is set to 0. But in Java, the code sets cum[s.length()] (which is cum[len_s] in Fortran) to 0. So yes.\n\nSo the Fortran code for building the cum array is:\n\ncum(0) = 0\ncum(len_s) = 0\ndo i = 1, len_s-1\n    if (s(i:i) == s(i+1:i+1)) then\n        cum(i) = cum(i-1) + 1\n    else\n        cum(i) = cum(i-1)\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop runs for i from 1 to len_s-1 (since i < len_s). For example, if the string length is 4, i runs 1, 2, 3. So in Fortran, the loop is from i=1 to len_s-1. So for len_s=4, i runs 1,2,3. Each time, check s(i) and s(i+1).\n\nBut in the Java code, the cumulative array's value at i represents the number of pairs up to index i-1. Wait, in Java's code, for i=1, which corresponds to the pair (0,1), and if they are equal, cum[1] = cum[0] +1. So cum[1] is 1. Then, for i=2, which is the pair (1,2), if equal, cum[2] = cum[1] +1, etc. So cum[i] in Java is the count of pairs from 0 up to i-1. So for i=3 (Java), it's the count up to 2. \n\nIn Fortran, the loop variable i runs from 1 to len_s-1. For each i, the pair is (i, i+1). So when we process i=1 (Fortran), the pair is (1,2). If they are equal, cum(1) = cum(0) +1. Then, for i=2 (Fortran), the pair is (2,3), and cum(2) is cum(1) plus 1 if equal. So cum(i) in Fortran represents the count of pairs from (1,2) up to (i, i+1). Wait, no. Because cum(1) is the count after checking the first pair. cum(2) is cum(1) plus the second pair. So cum(i) represents the total number of pairs up to and including the i-th pair (i.e., up to (i, i+1)).\n\nBut in the Java code, for the query l to r (after decrementing r by 1), the answer is cum[r] - cum[l-1]. So in the Java code, if the query is l=2, r=3 (after adjustment), then it's the sum from l-1 (1) to r (3). So cum[3] - cum[1-1=0].\n\nBut in Fortran's cum array, the indices would correspond to the pairs. Let's see. For example, if the string is \"aabb\", len_s=4. Then the pairs are (1,2) (equal), (2,3) (not), (3,4) (equal). So cum(1) = 1, cum(2)=1, cum(3)=2. cum(4) =0. So for a query l=1, r=4 (original), in Java r becomes 3. So answer is cum(3) - cum(0) = 2-0=2. Which is correct.\n\nIn Fortran, the same query would have l=1, r=4. Then the code would set r = r-1 =3, then compute cum(r) - cum(l-1). So cum(3) - cum(0) = 2-0=2. Which matches.\n\nSo the logic is correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to read the number of queries. Then, for each query, read l and r, compute r = r-1, then output cum(r) - cum(l-1).\n\nIn Fortran, reading the queries. The input for each query is two integers on a line. So for each query, read l and r.\n\nBut in Fortran, when using read(*,*) l, r, it reads from the next line. But in the Java code, each query is on a separate line. So the code should read each line as a pair of integers.\n\nSo after reading the number of queries, q, then loop q times:\n\ndo i = 1, q\n    read(*,*) l, r\n    r = r - 1\n    print *, cum(r) - cum(l-1)\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, when using list-directed input (read(*, *)), the code skips over whitespace and line breaks. So if each query is on a separate line, this works.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut first, handling the input string. The first line is the string, which can be read with read(*, '(a)') s. But in Fortran, the variable s must have a fixed length. So we can declare a character variable of sufficient length, like 100000.\n\nThen, len_s is the length of the actual input string, which can be found using len_trim(s).\n\nThen, allocate the cum array from 0 to len_s.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(100000) :: s\n    integer :: len_s, q, l, r, i\n    integer, allocatable :: cum(:)\n\n    read(*, '(a)') s\n    len_s = len_trim(s)\n    allocate(cum(0:len_s))\n    cum = 0\n    cum(0) = 0\n    cum(len_s) = 0\n    do i = 1, len_s - 1\n        if (s(i:i) == s(i+1:i+1)) then\n            cum(i) = cum(i-1) + 1\n        else\n            cum(i) = cum(i-1)\n        end if\n    end do\n    read(*, *) q\n    do i = 1, q\n        read(*, *) l, r\n        r = r - 1\n        print *, cum(r) - cum(l-1)\n    end do\n    deallocate(cum)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you allocate an array, you can initialize it. But in the code above, 'cum = 0' may not be correct. Because when you allocate the array, it's undefined. So setting cum(0) and cum(len_s) to 0, but for the other elements, the loop from 1 to len_s-1 sets them. But in the Java code, after initializing cum[0] and cum[len_s] to 0, the loop runs from 1 to len_s-1, which for a string of length len_s, the array is of size len_s +1, indexes 0 to len_s. So in Fortran, the cum array is allocated from 0 to len_s. The code initializes cum(0) and cum(len_s) to 0. The loop runs from i=1 to len_s-1, which covers all elements in between. But for len_s=0, this may cause issues, but the problem probably assumes the input string is non-empty.\n\nWait, but when len_s is 1 (the string is a single character), then the loop runs from i=1 to 0 (since len_s-1=0). So the loop doesn't run. So cum(0) and cum(1) are 0, and for any queries, which would have l=1 and r=1 (original), then r becomes 0, and l-1=0. So cum(0) - cum(0) =0. Which is correct as there are no pairs.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n1. The cum array is allocated from 0 to len_s. So for len_s=0, but the problem states that the input is a string, which can't be empty? The problem may not specify, but the Java code would handle it.\n\nBut since the problem's code reads a string, which is likely non-empty. So in Fortran, len_trim(s) would be zero if the input is empty. But in that case, the code would allocate cum(0:0), set cum(0) to 0, and process queries. But queries with l=1 would have l-1=0, which is allowed.\n\nAnother possible issue is that when len_s is zero, the code reads q, but if there's no string, perhaps the queries are not present. But according to the problem statement, perhaps the code can handle empty strings.\n\nBut assuming the input is as per the problem statement.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Fortran, when you have a character variable declared as character(100000), the read(*, '(a)') s will read the entire line into s, but if the line is shorter than 100000, the rest is filled with spaces. But len_trim(s) returns the position of the last non-space character. So if the input string contains spaces, this could cause issues. But the problem statement probably assumes that the input string does not contain spaces. Because in the Java code, the string is read using st.nextToken(), which splits on whitespace. So the input string is a single token, no whitespace. So in Fortran, the same applies. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nSample input:\naabb\n3\n1 4\n1 2\n2 3\n\nSample output:\n2\n1\n0\n\nIn the Java code, let's process this:\n\nThe string is \"aabb\", len_s=4.\n\ncum array is of size 5 (0-4).\n\ncum[0] =0.\n\nFor i=1: s[1] is 'a' (Java's 1 is the second character?), wait, no. Wait, Java's code for i=1 is checking s.charAt(1) and s.charAt(0). For \"aabb\", Java's s is \"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"b\". So i=1: 'a' and 'a' \u2192 cum[1] =1. i=2: 'a' and 'b' \u2192 cum[2]=1. i=3: 'b' and 'b' \u2192 cum[3] =2. cum[4] =0.\n\nQueries:\n\nFirst query: 1 4 \u2192 r=3. cum[3] - cum[0] \u2192 2-0=2.\n\nSecond query:1 2 \u2192 r=1. cum[1] - cum[0] \u21921.\n\nThird query:2 3 \u2192 r=2. cum[2] - cum[1] \u21921-1=0.\n\nSo the output is correct.\n\nIn the Fortran code:\n\ns is \"aabb\", len_trim(s) =4.\n\ncum array from 0 to 4.\n\ncum(0) =0.\n\ni runs from 1 to 3 (since len_s-1 is 3).\n\ni=1: s(1) and s(2) \u2192 'a' and 'a' \u2192 cum(1)=1.\n\ni=2: s(2) and s(3) \u2192 'a' and 'b' \u2192 no \u2192 cum(2)=1.\n\ni=3: s(3) and s(4) \u2192 'b' and 'b' \u2192 cum(3)=2.\n\ncum(4)=0.\n\nQueries:\n\n1 4 \u2192 r=3. cum(3) - cum(0) =2.\n\n1 2 \u2192 r=1 \u2192 cum(1) - cum(0) =1.\n\n2 3 \u2192 r=2 \u2192 cum(2) - cum(1) =0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work."
