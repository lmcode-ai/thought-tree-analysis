So in the quicksort example, the initial call would be call quicksort(a, 1, n). But implementing this recursive quicksort may be acceptable.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first to understand what it does.\n\nThe main part of the Java code is in the solve method. It reads n and k, then an array of n integers. Then it sorts the array and sums the first k elements. So the goal is to read the input, sort the array, sum the smallest k elements, and output the result.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to structure the Fortran program. Fortran programs typically start with a program block. Since Fortran is a procedural language, I can't use classes like in Java, so I need to structure the code using subroutines or functions if necessary.\n\nIn Java, they use a custom InputReader class to read inputs efficiently. In Fortran, reading from standard input can be done using read statements. But I need to handle the input correctly. The Java code reads n and k as integers, then reads the array elements.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and k from input.\n2. Read the array of size n.\n3. Sort the array in ascending order.\n4. Sum the first k elements.\n5. Print the sum.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, declaring variables. n, k are integers. The array is an integer array, size n. Then sum the first k elements after sorting.\n\nFor input, in Fortran, we can use read(*,*) to read from standard input. But the input might be in a single line or multiple lines. The Java code reads using nextInt(), which splits on any whitespace. So in Fortran, the same approach would work.\n\nSo the code structure would be something like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, k, i\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n    integer :: ans = 0\n\n    read(*, *) n, k\n    allocate(a(n))\n    read(*, *) a\n\n    ! sort the array\n    call sort(a)\n\n    ! sum first k elements\n    do i = 1, k\n        ans = ans + a(i)\n    end do\n\n    print *, ans\n\ncontains\n\n    ! implement a sorting subroutine\n    subroutine sort(arr)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        ! use a simple bubble sort for small arrays, but maybe for larger arrays a better sort is needed?\n        ! but the problem probably expects using the built-in sort if available. Wait, does Fortran have a built-in sort?\n\n        ! Hmm, in Fortran, there isn't a built-in sort function. So I need to implement one. Alternatively, use an existing implementation.\n\n        ! For simplicity, perhaps using the minloc approach for a selection sort.\n\n        integer :: i, j, temp\n        do i = 1, size(arr)\n            do j = i+1, size(arr)\n                if (arr(j) < arr(i)) then\n                    temp = arr(i)\n                    arr(i) = arr(j)\n                    arr(j) = temp\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end subroutine sort\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but the Java code uses Arrays.parallelSort(a), which sorts the array in ascending order. So we need to sort the array in ascending order. The above subroutine does a selection sort, which is O(n^2) but for small n (like programming competition problems where n could be up to 1e5?), but in the Java code, the problem is from AtCoder ABC 171 B. Typically, B problems have small constraints, so maybe n is small enough for a bubble sort.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more efficient sort is better, but for the sake of code simplicity, since we need to implement it ourselves, perhaps use an efficient algorithm. However, given that the original code uses parallelSort, which is a parallel version of the sort\u2014probably a merge sort or similar. But in Fortran, implementing a quick sort or merge sort would be more efficient. However, given that the code is to be written quickly, perhaps a selection sort or bubble sort is sufficient.\n\nBut for larger arrays, this would be too slow. However, the problem B from ABC 171 likely has small constraints. Let me check the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem: The user is to select K fruits with the smallest prices. The input is N K, then N integers. Sum the first K after sorting. So n can be up to, say, 1e5? But in programming competition, Java's parallelSort is efficient. However, in Fortran, a custom sort would be needed.\n\nBut perhaps in Fortran, there's a better way. Wait, Fortran 90 and later have intrinsic functions like minval, but no built-in sort. So we need to implement a sort.\n\nAlternatively, use an existing Fortran sort routine. Since the code needs to be self-contained, we need to implement the sort.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem's constraints, a simple O(n^2) sort is acceptable. For example, if n is up to 1000, then 1e6 operations. But if n is up to 1e5, that's 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nWait, the original code uses Arrays.parallelSort(a), which is a Java method. So the Java code is using a sort that's O(n log n). So if the Fortran code uses a O(n^2) algorithm, it would be too slow for large n.\n\nBut the problem's constraints for ABC 171 B? Let's think. AtCoder's B problem typically has n up to 1e5. For example, for the problem where K is up to N. So using a O(n^2) sort would not be feasible.\n\nSo we need a O(n log n) sort implementation in Fortran.\n\nHmm. So perhaps implementing a quick sort or merge sort.\n\nLet me think. Implementing a quick sort in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran 2003's intrinsic functions. Wait, no, Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function.\n\nSo, the code needs to include a sorting algorithm.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can use a quick sort.\n\nAlternatively, use an array that's sorted using the minloc approach.\n\nBut for code brevity, perhaps implementing a quick sort.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to do it using the minloc approach for each element.\n\nBut for the code, maybe the easiest way is to implement a quick sort.\n\nBut writing a quick sort in Fortran would be a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nUse the Fortran intrinsic function 'sort' from a library. Wait, but Fortran does not have such a function.\n\nSo, the user must implement a sorting algorithm.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should include a quick sort implementation.\n\nLet me look up a quick sort implementation in Fortran.\n\nHere's an example of a quick sort in Fortran:\n\nrecursive subroutine quicksort(a, first, last)\n  implicit none\n  integer, intent(inout) :: a(:)\n  integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n  integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n  if (first < last) then\n    pivot = a((first + last)/2)\n    i = first\n    j = last\n    do\n      do while (a(i) < pivot)\n        i = i + 1\n      end do\n      do while (a(j) > pivot)\n        j = j - 1\n      end do\n      if (i >= j) exit\n      temp = a(i)\n      a(i) = a(j)\n      a(j) = temp\n      i = i + 1\n      j = j - 1\n    end do\n    call quicksort(a, first, j)\n    call quicksort(a, j+1, last)\n  end if\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nBut to use this, the main program can call quicksort(a, 1, n), assuming the array is 1-based.\n\nBut in the code, when we read the array, Fortran's arrays are 1-based by default unless specified otherwise. So the code would allocate a(n) and read into a(1), a(2), ..., a(n).\n\nSo in the quicksort example, the initial call would be call quicksort(a, 1, n).\n\nBut implementing this recursive quicksort may be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, use a non-recursive implementation to avoid stack overflow for large n. But for the problem's constraints, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nSo, modifying the code to include a quicksort subroutine.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran code would:\n\n- Read n and k.\n\n- Read the array.\n\n- Sort it.\n\n- Sum the first k elements.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, k, i, ans\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n    read(*, *) n, k\n    allocate(a(n))\n    read(*, *) a\n\n    call quicksort(a, 1, n)\n\n    ans = 0\n    do i = 1, k\n        ans = ans + a(i)\n    end do\n\n    print *, ans\n\ncontains\n\n    recursive subroutine quicksort(a, first, last)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: a(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n        integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n        if (first < last) then\n            pivot = a((first + last)/2)\n            i = first\n            j = last\n            do\n                do while (a(i) < pivot)\n                    i = i + 1\n                end do\n                do while (a(j) > pivot)\n                    j = j - 1\n                end do\n                if (i >= j) exit\n                temp = a(i)\n                a(i) = a(j)\n                a(j) = temp\n                i = i + 1\n                j = j - 1\n            end do\n            call quicksort(a, first, j)\n            call quicksort(a, j+1, last)\n        end if\n    end subroutine quicksort\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you pass the array to a subroutine, the indices in the subroutine are based on the declared bounds. So if the array is declared as a(n) in the main program, which starts at index 1, then in the subroutine, the first and last parameters are 1 and n.\n\nBut when we pass a to the quicksort subroutine, the subroutine's a is the same array. So the code should work.\n\nBut let's test this with a sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n5 3\n5 3 2 4 1\n\nAfter sorting: 1 2 3 4 5. Sum first 3: 1+2+3=6. So the output should be 6.\n\nIn the code, after reading n=5, k=3, then array [5,3,2,4,1]. Then quicksort sorts it into 1,2,3,4,5. Summing first 3 gives 6. So code would output 6.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the array is read via read(*,*) a? In Fortran, when you read into an array, the elements are read in column-major order, but in this case, if the input is a single line with all elements, it should read them correctly.\n\nFor example, if the input line is \"5 3 5 3 2 4 1\", then the first read reads 5 and 3 into n and k, then the next read into a(5 elements). Wait, no. The first read is for n and k. The second read is for the array of n elements. So the input would be two lines:\n\nFirst line: 5 3\n\nSecond line:5 3 2 4 1\n\nOr they can be on the same line. Because the read(*, *) a will read the next n elements from the input, regardless of line breaks.\n\nSo the code should handle both cases.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The quicksort implementation. Let me check the logic.\n\nThe pivot is chosen as the middle element. Then i and j move towards each other, swapping elements that are on the wrong side of the pivot. Once they cross, the partition is done. Then recursively sort the left and right.\n\nThis should work correctly.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran's integer division. (first + last)/2. For even and odd numbers, but that's acceptable for pivot selection.\n\nAnother possible problem: the array indices. In Fortran, the array is 1-based. So first and last are 1 and n. The code should handle that.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be correct."
