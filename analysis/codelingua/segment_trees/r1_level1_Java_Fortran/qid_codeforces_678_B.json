    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main method reads a year, checks if it's a leap year, then starts a loop from the next year, accumulating the sum of days (365 or 366) each year. It checks when the sum modulo 7 becomes zero, meaning the same weekday, and if the leap year status matches the original year, then prints that year.\n\nFirst, I'll need to replicate the check_leap function. In Fortran, functions return values, so I'll write a logical function check_leap(y) that returns .true. if y is a leap year.\n\nThe main program will read the input year. Then, determine if it's a leap year. Then loop from y+1 upwards, calculate sum each iteration. For each i, add 366 if leap, else 365. Then check if sum mod 7 is zero. If yes, check if current i's leap status matches original. If so, print and exit.\n\nWait, the loop in Java is infinite, with a break when the condition is met. In Fortran, I can use a do loop with an exit condition.\n\nNow, variables: sum needs to be an integer. mod is a reserved word in Fortran, so maybe use 'remainder' instead. Oh, in the Java code, 'mod' is a variable but not used. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nWait, the Java code has 'int mod = 0;' but it's not used. Probably a leftover variable. So in Fortran, I can ignore that.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the input year.\n\n2. Check if it's leap (leap_original).\n\n3. Initialize sum to 0.\n\n4. Start a loop with i starting at y+1, incrementing by 1 each iteration.\n\n5. For each i, check if it's a leap year. Add 366 or 365 to sum.\n\n6. Check if sum modulo 7 is 0. If yes:\n\n   a. Check if the current i's leap status is same as original.\n\n   b. If yes, print i and exit.\n\n   c. Else, continue.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nUse a do loop with i starting from y+1, loop indefinitely until the condition is met.\n\nBut in Fortran, you can have a do loop with an exit condition.\n\nSo:\n\nsum = 0\n\ni = y + 1\n\ndo\n\n   calculate if current i is leap (leap_current)\n\n   add days to sum\n\n   check if sum mod 7 is 0.\n\n   if yes:\n\n      if (leap_current .eqv. leap_original) then\n\n         print i and exit\n\n      else:\n\n         cycle (but no, after adding, even if it's not the same leap, continue looping)\n\nWait, the Java code says:\n\nif (sum %7 ==0) {\n\n   if (check_leap(i) and leap OR ... ) then print and return\n\n   else continue.\n\nBut in Java, the loop is infinite until return. So in Fortran, after adding to sum each iteration, check sum mod7. If zero, then check leap status. If matches, output and exit. Else, proceed with next iteration.\n\nSo in code:\n\nsum = 0\n\nleap_original = check_leap(y)\n\ni = y + 1\n\ndo\n\n   leap_current = check_leap(i)\n\n   if (leap_current) then\n\n      sum = sum + 366\n\n   else\n\n      sum = sum + 365\n\n   end if\n\n   if (mod(sum,7) == 0) then\n\n      if ( (leap_current .and. leap_original) .or. (.not. leap_current .and. .not. leap_original) ) then\n\n         print *, i\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   i = i + 1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the loop, how does i increment? In Java, the for loop increments i each time. So in Fortran, the loop should start with i = y+1, then each time, after processing, increment i by 1.\n\nSo the code inside the loop:\n\nAt the start, check i, compute sum, then increment i for next iteration?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Java's for loop: for (int i = y+1; ; i++). So in each iteration, i is the current year being considered, then after processing, i is incremented. So in Fortran, after processing i, we need to increment i by 1 for the next iteration.\n\nSo in the Fortran loop:\n\nWe start with i = y+1.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nProcess i (check if it's leap, add days to sum), check conditions. Then, after that, increment i by 1.\n\nBut in the code above, after adding to sum, checking mod7, etc., then do i = i +1.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is for (i starts at y+1, then increments each iteration). So in each iteration, the code processes i, then i is incremented. So in Fortran, after processing i, increment i.\n\nSo in the Fortran loop:\n\nThe code for i is processed, then i is incremented for the next iteration.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nJava's for loop is:\n\nfor (int i = y+1; ; i++) { ... }\n\nSo first, i is y+1. Then, inside the loop, the code is executed. Then, i is incremented.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ni starts at y+1.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nprocess i.\n\nthen i = i +1.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ni = y+1\n\ndo \n\n   ... process i ...\n\n   i = i +1\n\nend do\n\nBut that's an infinite loop. But inside the loop, when the condition is met, we exit.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nprogram codeforces_678_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: y, i, sum\n\nlogical :: leap_original, leap_current\n\nread *, y\n\nleap_original = check_leap(y)\n\nsum = 0\n\ni = y +1\n\ndo\n\n   leap_current = check_leap(i)\n\n   if (leap_current) then\n\n      sum = sum + 366\n\n   else\n\n      sum = sum +365\n\n   end if\n\n   if (mod(sum,7) == 0) then\n\n      if ( (leap_current .and. leap_original) .or. (.not.leap_current .and. .not.leap_original) ) then\n\n         print *, i\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   i = i +1\n\nend do\n\ncontains\n\nlogical function check_leap(yy) result(is_leap)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: yy\n\nis_leap = .false.\n\nif (mod(yy,400) ==0) then\n\n   is_leap = .true.\n\nelse if (mod(yy,4) ==0 .and. mod(yy,100)/=0) then\n\n   is_leap = .true.\n\nend if\n\nend function check_leap\n\nend program codeforces_678_B\n\nWait, but the loop in Java adds the days for the next year each time. For example, when i starts as y+1 (the next year), adding 366 or 365 days. Then, the sum is accumulated. Then, check if sum mod 7 is zero. If yes, and the leap status matches, then output.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut in Fortran, when adding to sum, the days correspond to the year i, which is the next year. Then, check if the total sum mod 7 is zero, meaning that after adding those days, the next year's starting weekday is same as original.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases. For example, the original year is a leap year. The code checks that the new year's leap status is same as original, and that the sum mod7 is zero.\n\nSo the Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java code.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The modulus operation in Fortran uses mod(sum,7). But sum can be negative? Well, since sum is accumulated by 365 or 366, which are positive, sum is always positive. So mod is okay.\n\n- The check for leap year is correct. The Java code returns true if divisible by 400, or divisible by 4 but not 100. Same as the Fortran function.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, variables need to be declared. So sum and i are integers. The variables y is read as integer.\n\nAlso, the loop is an infinite loop that exits when the condition is met.\n\nSo this should work."
