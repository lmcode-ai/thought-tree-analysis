So the adjustl can be omitted. But to make the code robust, adding adjustl is better. But what if the input is \"12 . 34\"? Then the index of '.' is 3, but there's a space before. But the code would take the character before the dot (position 2, which is '2'), and process. But in reality, the input is invalid. So the code may not handle that, but the original Java code doesn't check for that. So the adjustl is used to move leading spaces to the left, but that's not sufficient if there are spaces in the middle. But the problem probably ensures that the input is a valid number. So proceed with the code as written.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first. The program reads a string input, finds the position of the dot, and then decides based on the digits around the dot whether to output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", round up the number before the dot, or just output it as is.\n\nFirst, in Java, they're reading a line, converting it to a char array. Then they find the index of the dot. If the digit before the dot is 9, they print the message. If the digit after the dot is greater than 4, they round up the integer part. Otherwise, they just print the integer part.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read a string, find the position of the dot. Let's think about how to handle that. Fortran has string manipulation functions, like INDEX to find the position of a character.\n\nWait, Fortran strings are 1-based, right? So the first character is position 1. So when we find the dot index, in Java it's 0-based, but in Fortran it's 1-based. So for example, if the input is \"123.456\", in Java dotIndex is 3, but in Fortran, INDEX returns 4. So when checking the character before the dot, in Java it's str[dotIndex - 1], which in Java's 0-based would be index 3-1=2 (third character). In Fortran, the dot is at position 4, so the previous character is at 4-1=3, which is correct.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read the input line as a string.\n\n2. Find the position of the dot. If there's no dot, maybe the code is not handling that, but the original Java code assumes there is one (since the problem probably guarantees it).\n\n3. Check if the character before the dot is '9'. If yes, output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n\n4. Else, check the first character after the dot. If it's >=5, increment the integer part and output. Otherwise, output the integer part as is.\n\nSo in Fortran, after reading the input string, we can use INDEX to get the dot's position.\n\nFor example, dot_pos = INDEX(input_str, '.'). Then check if input_str(dot_pos-1:dot_pos-1) == '9'. If so, print the message.\n\nIf not, check the next character. In Java, they take the first digit after the dot (str[dotIndex +1]). So in Fortran, that's input_str(dot_pos+1:dot_pos+1). Then convert that character to a number and see if it's >4.\n\nIf yes, then take the substring up to (dot_pos-1) characters, convert to integer, add 1, and print. Otherwise, print the substring up to the dot.\n\nBut wait, in Java, they are using BigInteger to handle potentially very long numbers, to avoid integer overflow. Fortran's integers have limited size. So if the input has a very long integer part (like hundreds of digits), then converting to a Fortran integer would fail. But the original code uses BigInteger, so the Fortran code needs to handle arbitrarily large integers as strings.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because Fortran's integer types can't handle arbitrary precision. So how to handle that?\n\nThe original code is adding 1 to the integer part. So if the integer part is a very long string of digits, adding 1 would require manual handling.\n\nBut given that the Java code uses BigInteger, which can handle any length, the Fortran code should also handle this. But Fortran doesn't have arbitrary-precision integers. So how can we handle this?\n\nThis might complicate things. So the original problem probably expects that the input's integer part is not too big for standard data types, but perhaps the test cases are designed such that the integer part is small. But given that the Java code uses BigInteger, the Fortran code might need to handle the integer part as a string and perform the increment manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem constraints ensure that the integer part is small enough to fit into a Fortran integer.\n\nBut without knowing the problem constraints, perhaps we need to handle the case where the integer part could be very long.\n\nSo the Java code builds a string of the integer part (characters before the dot) and converts it to a BigInteger, adds one, and outputs it. To do the same in Fortran, we need to implement the increment operation on the string.\n\nSo, let's think: the integer part is a string of digits. We need to add 1 to it, handling possible carryovers. For example, \"999\" becomes \"1000\".\n\nSo, the steps for adding 1:\n\n1. Start from the end of the string, moving left.\n\n2. Add 1 to the current digit. If it becomes 10, set it to 0 and carry over 1.\n\n3. Repeat until carry is zero or we reach the start.\n\n4. If carry is still 1 after processing all digits, prepend a '1'.\n\nThis requires implementing a string-based increment function.\n\nBut writing this in Fortran is a bit involved.\n\nSo, perhaps for the Fortran code, the approach would be:\n\n- Extract the integer part as a string (all characters before the dot).\n\n- If the first character after the dot is >=5, increment the integer part string.\n\n- Then output the incremented string.\n\nOtherwise, output the integer part as is.\n\nSo the key is to implement the increment function for a string of digits.\n\nSo, in the Fortran code:\n\nAfter getting the integer_part string (from 1 to dot_pos-1), we need to increment it.\n\nSo let's outline the code steps:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nFind the position of the dot.\n\nCheck if the character before the dot is '9' \u2192 output message.\n\nElse:\n\n   check if the first character after the dot is >=5.\n\n   if yes:\n\n      increment the integer part (as a string) and print.\n\n   else:\n\n      print the integer part.\n\nSo the main challenge is to implement the increment function.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nIn Fortran, we can read the input using read(*,'(a)') input_str. But we need to ensure that the input is read properly, trimming any leading/trailing spaces. However, the problem probably provides the number as a string with no spaces, like \"123.456\".\n\nNext, find the dot:\n\ndot_pos = INDEX(input_str, '.')\n\nIf there's no dot, the original code might not handle it, but the problem probably ensures that the input is correct.\n\nNow, check if the character before the dot is '9':\n\nif (input_str(dot_pos-1:dot_pos-1) == '9') then\n\n   print *, \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n\nelse\n\n   check the next character.\n\n   char_after_dot = input_str(dot_pos+1:dot_pos+1)\n\n   if (char_after_dot >= '5') then\n\n      increment the integer part.\n\n      print the result.\n\n   else\n\n      print the integer part.\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nSo the integer part is input_str(1:dot_pos-1). So we can extract that as a substring.\n\nThen, incrementing that string.\n\nHow to handle the increment:\n\nLet's write a function or a subroutine to increment a digit string.\n\nIn Fortran, we can process each character from the end to the beginning.\n\nInitialize a carry of 1.\n\nLoop from the end of the string to the beginning:\n\n   digit = ICHAR(str(i:i)) - ICHAR('0')\n\n   new_digit = digit + carry\n\n   if new_digit == 10 then\n\n       new_digit = 0\n\n       carry = 1\n\n   else\n\n       carry = 0\n\n   endif\n\n   str(i:i) = ACHAR(ICHAR('0') + new_digit)\n\n   if carry is 0, exit loop.\n\nIf after processing all digits, carry is 1, then we need to prepend '1' to the string.\n\nFor example, the string '999' becomes '000' after increment with carry, then we add '1' at the beginning.\n\nSo, here's how the code could look:\n\nsubroutine increment_string(str)\n\n    character(len=*), intent(inout) :: str\n\n    integer :: i, carry, digit, new_digit\n\n    carry = 1\n\n    do i = len_trim(str), 1, -1\n\n        digit = ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n        new_digit = digit + carry\n\n        if (new_digit >= 10) then\n\n            new_digit = new_digit - 10\n\n            carry = 1\n\n        else\n\n            carry = 0\n\n        endif\n\n        str(i:i) = achar(ichar('0') + new_digit)\n\n        if (carry == 0) exit\n\n    end do\n\n    if (carry == 1) then\n\n        str = '1' // str\n\n    endif\n\nend subroutine\n\nBut wait, Fortran has fixed-length strings unless using allocatable or other features. But when passing to a subroutine, the length is fixed. So if the original string's length is not enough to hold the incremented value, this could be a problem.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the integer_part string is stored in a variable that is long enough. Or we can use a temporary variable.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, when extracting the integer part, we can store it in a variable with enough length. For example, if the input line is up to, say, 1000 characters, the integer part could be up to 1000 characters. But when incrementing, adding a leading '1' would require an extra character.\n\nBut handling this in Fortran requires that the variable holding the integer part is large enough.\n\nAlternatively, use a variable with sufficient length. Let's assume that the maximum possible length is, say, 1000. So when we extract the integer_part, we can store it in a variable of length 1000, but in practice, the actual integer part is shorter. Then, after increment, if we need to add a leading '1', the variable's length must allow for that. But if the variable is declared as, say, character(1000), then after processing, we can trim leading spaces or zeros (but no, since leading zeros are part of the number, but in the problem, the input probably doesn't have leading zeros, except maybe for zero itself).\n\nWait, in the original Java code, the input is read as a string. For example, if the input is \"9999999999999999999999999.4\", then the code would output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" if the digit before the dot is 9, else round accordingly.\n\nBut in Fortran, when we have to increment a long string, the code's approach would be to process it as a string.\n\nSo in the code:\n\n- The integer_part is stored as a string.\n\n- The increment is done via the subroutine as above.\n\nBut handling the variable length. Let's say the code uses a character variable with sufficient length. For example, in Fortran, when extracting the integer part (from 1 to dot_pos-1), the length of the integer part is dot_pos-1 characters.\n\nSo, in Fortran code:\n\ncharacter(1000) :: integer_part\n\ninteger_part = input_str(1:dot_pos-1)\n\ncall increment_string(integer_part)\n\nBut the problem is that the variable 'integer_part' is declared as length 1000, but when we pass it to the subroutine, the subroutine's 'str' is length 1000, so the loop runs from len_trim(str) down to 1. However, if the actual integer_part is shorter, len_trim(integer_part) would give the correct length.\n\nWait, len_trim returns the position of the last non-blank character. But in the code, after extracting input_str(1:dot_pos-1), the integer_part is assigned to a variable of length 1000. So if the actual integer part is, say, 5 characters, then integer_part would be those 5 characters followed by 995 blanks. So len_trim(integer_part) is 5.\n\nBut when we process the string, we need to process from the end (5th character) backward. The code in the subroutine would loop from i = 5 down to 1, then if there's a carry, prepend '1' to the string. But since the variable is of length 1000, the '1' would be added at the beginning, and the rest would shift. Wait, no. Because in Fortran, when you assign a string longer than the variable's length, it's truncated. So, for example:\n\nIf the variable is character(5), and you assign '12345', then assign '123456', it becomes '12345'.\n\nBut in our case, when we have a variable of length 1000, and the integer_part is, say, 5 characters, then the rest is filled with spaces. But when we process, we first trim to get the actual length.\n\nWait, but when we process the integer_part, we need to process all the digits, which are in the left part of the string, followed by spaces. Wait, no. Because in the assignment integer_part = input_str(1:dot_pos-1), if input_str(1:dot_pos-1) is, say, 3 characters, and integer_part is 1000 characters, then the first 3 characters are copied, and the rest are filled with spaces. So len_trim(integer_part) would be 3. So the loop in the subroutine would process the 3 characters, correctly.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nBut when we assign the incremented string back, for example, if the integer_part was '999', after increment, it becomes '000' with carry 1, so the subroutine would prepend '1', making the new string '1000', but since the variable is length 1000, the rest would be filled with spaces. So when we output the string, we need to trim any trailing spaces. Wait, no, the leading part is '1000' followed by spaces. But when we output the string, it would print all 1000 characters, including the spaces. That's a problem.\n\nSo we need to trim the leading digits and ignore the trailing spaces. But how?\n\nAlternatively, after incrementing, the integer_part is a string with leading digits and trailing spaces. So when printing, we need to output only the non-space characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you print a character variable, it prints all characters, including trailing spaces, which would be incorrect.\n\nSo to avoid that, after processing, we need to trim the integer_part to the leftmost non-space characters.\n\nWait, no. The integer_part is, for example, '123   ' (with trailing spaces). When you print it, it would print '123' followed by spaces. Which is not desired.\n\nSo, the solution is to find the actual length of the digits after increment and output only that part.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the code can use the original length of the integer_part (dot_pos-1) and adjust if the length increases by 1 (due to carry).\n\nAlternatively, after incrementing, the integer_part may have leading digits followed by spaces. So, when we print, we need to print all characters up to the first space. But that's not correct, because the integer_part could have leading digits followed by spaces. So the correct way is to take the left-justified string and trim any trailing spaces. But Fortran's TRIM function trims trailing spaces. So, for example, TRIM(integer_part) would give the string without trailing spaces. But if the increment caused leading digits and then spaces, TRIM would remove the trailing spaces. But if the original integer_part was '999' (stored as '999' followed by spaces), after incrementing, it's '1000' followed by spaces. Then TRIM(integer_part) would be '1000' followed by the spaces. Wait, no: TRIM removes trailing spaces, so '1000   ' becomes '1000'.\n\nBut when the code increments, the subroutine adds a '1' at the beginning. For example, if the original integer_part is '999', which is stored as '999' followed by 997 spaces, after incrementing, the subroutine changes the first three characters to '000', then adds a '1' at the beginning. So the variable becomes '1000' followed by 996 spaces. Then TRIM(integer_part) would return '1000' (assuming there's a space after the 1000?), no. Wait, the code would have:\n\ninteger_part = input_str(1:dot_pos-1) \u2192 which is, for example, '999', stored in a 1000-length variable as '999' followed by 997 spaces.\n\nThe subroutine increments this. The code in the subroutine processes each character from the end (i=3, then 2, then 1). Adding 1 to each '9' (which becomes 0 with carry). After processing all three, carry is 1. So prepend '1' \u2192 the string becomes '1' followed by '000' and then the remaining 996 spaces. So the string is '1000' followed by 996 spaces. So TRIM(integer_part) would return '1000' (since TRIM removes trailing spaces). So when printing, output TRIM(integer_part) would be correct.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, after incrementing, print the trimmed version.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nprint '(a)', trim(integer_part)\n\nSimilarly, when the code outputs the integer part as is, it's input_str(1:dot_pos-1). But that part may have trailing spaces if the variable is longer. Wait, no. The input_str is read as, say, '123.45', so input_str(1:dot_pos-1) is '123', stored into a 1000-length variable as '123' followed by spaces. So when we print that variable, we should trim it.\n\nSo in the code, whenever we need to print the integer part, we should print the trimmed version.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe steps for the code:\n\nRead input_str.\n\nFind dot_pos.\n\nIf the character before the dot is '9', print message.\n\nElse:\n\n   char_after_dot = input_str(dot_pos+1:dot_pos+1)\n\n   if (char_after_dot >= '5') then\n\n      integer_part = input_str(1:dot_pos-1)\n\n      call increment_string(integer_part)\n\n      print *, trim(integer_part)\n\n   else\n\n      print *, trim(input_str(1:dot_pos-1))\n\n   end if\n\nNow, the code for the increment_string subroutine.\n\nBut in Fortran, subroutines need to be in the same module or in the contains section if it's an internal subroutine.\n\nAssuming that the code is in a program with an internal subroutine.\n\nBut Fortran's fixed-form or free-form. Let's use free-form.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_99_A\n    implicit none\n    character(1000) :: input_str\n    integer :: dot_pos\n    character(1) :: char_after_dot\n    character(1000) :: integer_part\n\n    read(*, '(a)') input_str\n    input_str = adjustl(input_str)  ! Remove leading spaces if any\n    dot_pos = index(input_str, '.')\n\n    if (dot_pos == 0) then\n        ! Handle error, but assume input has a dot per problem statement\n        print *, \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    if (input_str(dot_pos-1:dot_pos-1) == '9') then\n        print *, \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n    else\n        char_after_dot = input_str(dot_pos+1:dot_pos+1)\n        if (char_after_dot >= '5') then\n            integer_part = input_str(1:dot_pos-1)\n            call increment_string(integer_part)\n            print *, trim(integer_part)\n        else\n            print *, trim(input_str(1:dot_pos-1))\n        end if\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine increment_string(str)\n        character(len=*), intent(inout) :: str\n        integer :: i, carry, digit, new_digit\n        integer :: length\n\n        carry = 1\n        length = len_trim(str)  ! Get the actual length of the number part\n\n        do i = length, 1, -1\n            digit = ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n            new_digit = digit + carry\n            if (new_digit >= 10) then\n                new_digit = new_digit - 10\n                carry = 1\n            else\n                carry = 0\n            end if\n            str(i:i) = achar(ichar('0') + new_digit)\n            if (carry == 0) exit\n        end do\n\n        if (carry == 1) then\n            ! Prepend '1' to the string. Since str may have trailing spaces,\n            ! shift the existing characters to the right by one and add '1' at the start.\n            str = '1' // str(1:length)\n        end if\n    end subroutine increment_string\n\nend program codeforces_99_A\n\nWait, but when prepending '1', the length of the string may exceed the original length. For example, if the original integer_part is '999' stored in a 1000-length variable, after incrementing, we need to prepend '1' to make '1000'. The code in the increment subroutine does str = '1' // str(1:length). Since str is a 1000-length variable, '1' concatenated with str(1:length) (which is 3 characters) gives 4 characters, and the rest are filled with spaces. So str becomes '1000' followed by 996 spaces. Then, when we print trim(str), it becomes '1000'.\n\nBut what if the original integer_part is longer than the allocated length of str? For example, if the integer_part is 999 characters long, and the variable is declared as 1000-length. Adding '1' would require 1000 characters, but the variable can hold it. So the code should be okay.\n\nBut in the code, 'str' in the increment subroutine is declared with len=*, so it takes the length of the actual argument. The actual argument is 'integer_part' which is 1000 characters. So the code can handle up to 1000 digits. Which is sufficient for practical purposes.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: 123.456\n\ndot_pos is 4.\n\nCheck character at 3: '3' != '9'.\n\nCheck next character: '4' <5 \u2192 output 123.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nInput: 999.999\n\ndot_pos is 4.\n\nCharacter before dot is '9' \u2192 output message.\n\nTest case 3:\n\nInput: 1234.5\n\ndot_pos is 5.\n\nCharacter after dot is '5' \u2192 increment.\n\ninteger_part is '1234'.\n\nIncrement to 1235. Output 1235.\n\nTest case 4:\n\nInput: 999.6 \u2192 char after is 6>5. Increment 999 \u2192 1000.\n\nSo code should output 1000.\n\nAnother test case: 1999.6 \u2192 increment 1999 to 2000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut in the code, when the input is read, the adjustl is used. Why? Because the read statement may have leading spaces, but the problem's input probably doesn't. But to handle possible leading spaces, adjustl moves the input to the left, trimming leading spaces.\n\nBut the original Java code reads the entire line as the input string, including leading spaces. So the adjustl ensures that leading spaces are ignored. Wait, but in the Java code, new Scanner(System.in).nextLine().toCharArray(), so leading spaces are part of the input. So, if the input is \" 123.45\", the Java code would process it as such, leading to possible errors (since the code expects the integer part to be before the dot). So the adjustl in Fortran would move the '123.45' to the left, so leading spaces are ignored. So this may be a discrepancy.\n\nBut the problem probably ensures that the input is a valid number with no leading spaces. So perhaps the adjustl is unnecessary. But to make the code handle possible leading spaces, it's safer to include adjustl.\n\nBut in the original code, the input may have leading spaces, but the code would process them as part of the number, which is incorrect. For example, \" 12.3\" would have the integer part as \" 12\", which is invalid. So the adjustl is needed to trim leading spaces so that the integer part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is always a valid number with no leading or trailing spaces. So the adjustl can be omitted.\n\nBut to make the code robust, adding adjustl is better.\n\nBut what if the input is \"12 . 34\"? Then the index of '.' is 3, but there's a space before. But the code would take the character before the dot (position 2, which is '2'), and process. But in reality, the input is invalid. So the code may not handle that, but the original Java code doesn't check for that.\n\nSo the adjustl is used to move leading spaces to the left, but that's not sufficient if there are spaces in the middle. But the problem probably ensures that the input is a valid number.\n\nSo proceed with the code as written.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be as above."
