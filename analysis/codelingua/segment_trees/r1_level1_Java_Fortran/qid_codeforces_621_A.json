    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads an integer n, then a list of n long integers. It separates even and odd numbers. All even numbers are added to the sum. The odd numbers are collected into a list, sorted, then added to the sum. But if there's an odd number of odd numbers, the smallest one (since the list is sorted in ascending order) is subtracted from the total sum. So the goal is to get the maximum possible sum that's even, I think.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure this in Fortran. \n\nFirst, the input. In Java, they use Scanner to read inputs. In Fortran, we'll use READ statements. The first input is n, then n numbers. \n\nIn Java, they have an ArrayList for the odd numbers. In Fortran, we can use an array. But since we don't know how many odds there are upfront, maybe we need to count them first, then allocate an array of that size. Wait, or perhaps read all numbers, process each one, and collect the odds into an array. Let's think: in Java, they collect all odds into a list, then sort it. So in Fortran, perhaps read all numbers into an array, then loop through each, separate evens and odds. Sum the evens, collect the odds into another array. Then sort that array. Then sum all odds. If the count of odds is odd, subtract the smallest (first element after sorting).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n numbers into a list (array in Fortran).\n3. Separate even and odd numbers.\n4. Sum all evens.\n5. Collect odds into an array.\n6. Sort the odds array.\n7. Sum all elements in the sorted odds array and add to sum.\n8. If the number of odds is odd, subtract the first element (smallest) from sum.\n9. Output the sum.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- n is integer.\n- The numbers are of type long in Java, which is 64-bit. Fortran uses INTEGER(8) for 64-bit integers, but maybe in Fortran, if the numbers can be large, we should use INTEGER(KIND=8). Alternatively, depending on the compiler, but assuming the numbers can be up to 10^18, we need 64-bit integers.\n\nSo variables:\n\nINTEGER :: n\nINTEGER(KIND=8), ALLOCATABLE :: numbers(:), odd(:)\nINTEGER :: i, count_odd\nINTEGER(KIND=8) :: sum, num\n\nBut wait, Java's long is 64-bit, so in Fortran, using INTEGER(8) is appropriate.\n\nSo first, read n:\n\nREAD(*,*) n\n\nThen, allocate numbers array of size n:\n\nALLOCATE(numbers(n))\n\nThen read the numbers:\n\nDO i = 1, n\n    READ(*,*) numbers(i)\nEND DO\n\nThen loop through each number. For each number:\n\nsum_even starts at 0. Then, collect odds into an array. So count how many odds first. Wait, but in the Java code, they add all even numbers to sum, then process the odds. So perhaps:\n\nInitialize sum = 0 (sum is even_sum + sum of odds, adjusted if needed).\n\nThen, create an array to hold the odd numbers. But how to collect them? In Fortran, perhaps count the number of odds first, then allocate the array. Alternatively, collect them in a dynamic array. But Fortran's ALLOCATABLE arrays can be handled with moving_alloc or similar techniques, but that's a bit cumbersome. Alternatively, first count the number of odds, then allocate the array of that size, then loop through again to collect them.\n\nWait, perhaps first loop through the numbers once to count how many odds there are, then loop again to collect them. Or during the first loop, collect even sum and count the odds. Let's see.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nInitialize sum_even = 0\n\ncount_odd = 0\n\nLoop over each number:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    num = numbers(i)\n    if (mod(num, 2) == 0) then\n        sum_even = sum_even + num\n    else\n        count_odd = count_odd + 1\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen allocate the odd array with size count_odd.\n\nThen loop again through the numbers to collect the odds into the array.\n\nWait, but that would require two passes. Alternatively, during the first loop, collect the odds into a temporary array, but since in Fortran, arrays need to be allocated with a size. So perhaps first loop to count, then allocate, then collect.\n\nSo:\n\nsum_even = 0\ncount_odd = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    num = numbers(i)\n    if (mod(num, 2_8) == 0) then\n        sum_even = sum_even + num\n    else\n        count_odd = count_odd + 1\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen allocate odd(count_odd), then loop again:\n\nj = 1\ndo i = 1, n\n    num = numbers(i)\n    if (mod(num, 2_8) /= 0) then\n        odd(j) = num\n        j = j + 1\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut this requires two loops. Alternatively, perhaps collect the odds in a dynamic array. But Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays like ArrayList, but you can use a temporary array, copy, and expand. But that's more complex and less efficient. So the two-pass approach is probably better here.\n\nOnce the odd array is filled, we need to sort it in ascending order. In Java, it's Collections.sort(odd). In Fortran, we can use the intrinsic sort function, but Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort for arrays. Wait, actually, Fortran 2003 and later have some array intrinsic functions, but perhaps we need to implement a sort or use a library. Alternatively, since the code is simple, maybe implement a simple bubble sort, but for larger arrays that's not efficient, but since the code is for a programming competition problem, maybe the inputs are manageable. Or perhaps use the sort from the standard libraries, but how?\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Fortran 90 approach and use the intrinsic function, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps using the 'sort' function from the Fortran standard library, but I'm not sure if that's available. Alternatively, write a quick sort.\n\nAlternatively, use a simple call to sort the array. Wait, perhaps in the code submission, using a simple bubble sort would be acceptable here. Let's proceed with that.\n\nBut given that the original Java code uses a sort, which is O(n log n), and the odds could be up to n elements (if all are odd), but for code submission purposes, perhaps using a simple O(n^2) sort is acceptable if n is small. But given that the problem's constraints are not known, perhaps it's better to implement a quick sort or a merge sort.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is small (assuming that in programming competition), bubble sort is acceptable. Let's proceed with a bubble sort.\n\nSo code for sorting:\n\nBut perhaps the code will use the fact that after sorting, the first element is the smallest. So even if the array is sorted in ascending order, the first element is the minimum.\n\nSo, in Fortran, to sort the odd array in ascending order.\n\nAlternatively, use the MINLOC function to find the minimum, but since we need the entire array sorted, perhaps the code needs a proper sorting algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, use a Fortran subroutine for sorting. Let's write a simple bubble sort.\n\nSubroutine to sort an array in ascending order.\n\nBut perhaps in the code, I can use a built-in function. Wait, maybe not. So here's the plan for sorting:\n\nImplement a bubble sort on the odd array.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'SORT' function from the intrinsic module, but I'm not sure. Let me check. Oh, Fortran does not have a built-in sort function. So need to implement it.\n\nSo code for bubble sort:\n\nsubroutine bubble_sort(arr)\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    integer :: i, j, n\n    integer(kind=8) :: temp\n    n = size(arr)\n    do i = 1, n-1\n        do j = 1, n-i\n            if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n                temp = arr(j)\n                arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n                arr(j+1) = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nThen, after collecting the odd array, call bubble_sort(odd).\n\nOnce sorted, sum all elements of the odd array. Then, check if the count_odd is odd. If yes, subtract the first element (since the array is sorted in ascending order, the first element is the smallest).\n\nSo sum_odds is sum(odd). Then sum_total = sum_even + sum_odds.\n\nIf count_odd is odd, then sum_total = sum_total - odd(1).\n\nThen output sum_total.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate numbers array with size n.\n\nRead n numbers into numbers array.\n\nCompute sum_even and count_odd.\n\nAllocate odd array with count_odd elements.\n\nCollect the odd numbers into the array.\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute sum_odds = sum(odd).\n\nsum_total = sum_even + sum_odds.\n\nIf count_odd is odd, sum_total = sum_total - odd(1).\n\nPrint sum_total.\n\nNow, let's code this in Fortran, taking care with variable types.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The use of 64-bit integers. In Fortran, we can declare variables with INTEGER(8).\n\n- The MOD function must use the correct kind. For example, mod(num, 2_8) to ensure that the 2 is treated as a 64-bit integer.\n\n- The sum_even should be initialized to 0_8 to have the correct kind.\n\n- The sorting subroutine must handle 64-bit integers.\n\nSo, let's code:\n\nprogram codeforces_621_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, j, count_odd\n    integer(8), allocatable :: numbers(:), odd(:)\n    integer(8) :: sum_even, sum_total, num\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(numbers(n))\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) numbers(i)\n    end do\n\n    sum_even = 0_8\n    count_odd = 0\n\n    ! First pass: compute sum_even and count_odd\n    do i = 1, n\n        num = numbers(i)\n        if (mod(num, 2_8) == 0) then\n            sum_even = sum_even + num\n        else\n            count_odd = count_odd + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Allocate odd array and collect odd numbers\n    if (count_odd > 0) then\n        allocate(odd(count_odd))\n        j = 1\n        do i = 1, n\n            num = numbers(i)\n            if (mod(num, 2_8) /= 0) then\n                odd(j) = num\n                j = j + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Sort the odd array\n        call bubble_sort(odd)\n\n        sum_total = sum_even + sum(odd)\n\n        ! Check if count_odd is odd\n        if (mod(count_odd, 2) /= 0) then\n            sum_total = sum_total - odd(1)\n        end if\n    else\n        sum_total = sum_even\n    end if\n\n    print *, sum_total\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine bubble_sort(arr)\n        integer(8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer :: i, j, n\n        integer(8) :: temp\n        n = size(arr)\n        do i = 1, n-1\n            do j = 1, n-i\n                if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n                    temp = arr(j)\n                    arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n                    arr(j+1) = temp\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end subroutine bubble_sort\n\nend program codeforces_621_A\n\nNow, let's check for possible issues.\n\n- What if there are no odd numbers? Then count_odd is 0. The code handles that by setting sum_total to sum_even.\n\n- The sorting is done via bubble sort. For large arrays, this is slow, but given that in programming competition, perhaps the constraints are acceptable. The original code uses Java's sort which is O(n log n), but bubble sort is O(n^2). However, for the problem's constraints, if n is up to 1e5, this would be a problem. But looking at the original code, the Java code uses a list and then sorts it. However, the problem statement is not provided. But in the absence of that, perhaps we have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Fortran, array indices start at 1 unless specified. The code uses 1-based indices, which is correct here.\n\nTesting with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\nEvens: 2. Sum_even = 2.\n\nOdds: 1, 3. Sorted becomes [1,3]. sum_odds =4. count_odd is 2 (even). sum_total = 2+4=6. So output is 6.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4\n\n2 4 6 8\n\nAll evens. sum_even=20. No odds. sum_total=20.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5\n\n1 3 5 7 9\n\ncount_odd=5 (odd). sum_even=0.\n\nsum_odds=1+3+5+7+9=25. Since count_odd is 5 (odd), subtract the first element (1). sum_total=25-1=24.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nAnother test case from the problem example:\n\nOriginal Java code's sample input (probably):\n\nFor example, the sample input in the problem:\n\nLet's see:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3 \u2192 sum_evens=2. Odds are [1,3]. sum_odds=4. total=6. But count_odd is 2 (even), so no subtraction. Output 6.\n\nAnother example:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4\n\n1 3 5 7 \u2192 count_odd=4. sum_evens=0. sum_odds=16. count_odd even \u2192 total 16.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n1\n\n1 \u2192 count_odd=1. sum_evens=0. sum_odds=1. Then subtract 1. sum_total=0.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should correctly implement the logic of the Java code."
