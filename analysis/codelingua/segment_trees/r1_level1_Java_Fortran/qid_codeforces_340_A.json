In the loop where we compute c, after setting c = x * j or y * j, j increments. For example, if x is larger than y, then j starts at 2, so c = x*2, then j becomes 3, next iteration would be x*3, etc. But in the Java code, the loop continues until c is a multiple of the smaller number. So after each step, the new c is checked for divisibility by the min(x,y). So this approach works. But wait, for example, if x=6 and y=4. Then max(x,y) is 6. The min is 4. 6 mod 4 is 2.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads four integers: x, y, a, b. Then it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of x and y, but maybe not directly. Wait, the code seems to compute a value 'c' which is the LCM of x and y. Let me check:\n\nIn Java, the code starts by setting c to the maximum of x and y. Then, it checks if c is already a multiple of the smaller of x and y. If not, it increments c by multiplying the larger one by j (starting at 2) until c becomes a multiple of the smaller. So that's essentially finding the LCM. Because LCM(x,y) is the smallest number that's a multiple of both x and y. So if the maximum of x and y isn't a multiple of the other, they increment it until it is.\n\nOnce c is determined, the code checks if c is beyond b. If so, output 0. Otherwise, it counts how many multiples of c are between a and b inclusive.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read x, y, a, b.\n2. Compute LCM of x and y as c.\n3. If c > b, output 0.\n4. Else, find the first multiple of c >= a, then compute how many multiples exist between that and b.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the structure.\n\nFortran uses static typing, so variables need to be declared. We'll need to use integer variables. Also, input is handled differently. Let's outline the steps:\n\n- Declare variables: x, y, a, b, j, i, x1, y1, c, count. Wait, but in the Java code, x1 and y1 are declared but not used. So maybe they can be omitted. Let me check the Java code again. Oh right, x1 and y1 are initialized to 0 but never used. So I can ignore those variables in Fortran.\n\nVariables in Fortran should be declared with appropriate types. Since the Java code uses long, which is 64-bit integers, in Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) to handle large numbers.\n\nSo variables: x, y, a, b, j, c, i, count. Also, the boolean 'ans' is used. In Fortran, logical variables are used.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read the inputs. In Java, using Scanner, but in Fortran, we can use read(*,*) to read from standard input.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram codeforces_340_A\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: x, y, a, b, j, c, i, count\nlogical :: ans\n\nread(*,*) x, y, a, b\n\nThen, set c to the maximum of x and y. In Fortran, max(x,y).\n\nc = max(x, y)\n\nCheck if c > b. If so, print 0 and set ans to false.\n\nans = .true.\nif (c > b) then\n    print *, 0\n    ans = .false.\nend if\n\nBut in Java, after this check, there's a while loop that runs only if ans is true. Wait, the Java code:\n\nif (c > b) {\n    System.out.println(\"0\");\n    ans = false;\n}\n\nThen, while (c % min(x,y) !=0 and ans) { ... }\n\nWait, but if c is >b, ans is false, so the loop doesn't run.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the initial check, we need to enter a loop only if ans is true.\n\nSo after the initial check, if ans is true, then enter the loop.\n\nWait, the Java code's while loop is:\n\nwhile (c % Math.min(x,y) !=0 && ans) { ... }\n\nWhich means, as long as c is not divisible by the min(x,y), and ans is true.\n\nSo the loop continues until c is a multiple of the smaller of x and y.\n\nIn Fortran, we can use a do loop with exit conditions.\n\nBut the Java code uses a while loop, so perhaps:\n\ndo while (mod(c, min(x,y)) /= 0 .and. ans)\n\nBut in the loop, they check if x > y. If so, multiply x by j (starting at 2) and increment j each time. Otherwise, multiply y by j. Then check if this new c exceeds b. If so, output 0 and set ans to false.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop:\n\nj starts at 2. Then, inside the loop, if x > y, c = x * j, j increments. Else, c = y * j, j increments. Then check if c > b. If so, output 0 and break.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nwhile (c % Math.min(x, y) != 0 && ans) {\n    if (x > y) {\n        c = x * j;\n        j++;\n    } else {\n        c = y * j;\n        j++;\n    }\n    if (c > b) {\n        System.out.println(\"0\");\n        ans = false;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nSo this loop is trying to find the LCM by multiplying the larger of x and y by j (starting from 2) until c becomes a multiple of the smaller one.\n\nWait, but this approach may not always work. For example, if x is 4 and y is 6. The maximum is 6. 6 is already a multiple of 4? No. So the code would enter the loop. Then, since x (4) < y (6), else branch is taken. c = y * j (j=2) \u2192 12. Then check 12 mod 4 is 0. So the loop exits. Then c is 12. Which is LCM(4,6) = 12. So the code works here.\n\nBut what if x and y are co-prime? For example, x=3, y=5. Max is 5. Then check 5 mod 3 is 2. So loop. Since x < y, multiply y (5) by j=2 \u2192 10. Check 10 mod 3 is 1. Still not. Multiply by j=3 \u219215. 15 mod3=0. So c=15. Which is LCM(3,5)=15. So correct.\n\nSo this code correctly calculates the LCM as c.\n\nBut in Fortran, how to implement this loop?\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nj = 2\n\ndo while (mod(c, min(x,y)) /= 0 .and. ans)\n    if (x > y) then\n        c = x * j\n    else\n        c = y * j\n    end if\n    j = j + 1\n    if (c > b) then\n        print *, 0\n        ans = .false.\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but the loop is a do while loop. However, in the Java code, after updating c and j, it checks if c > b. So the code in the loop may increment c, then check, and if it exceeds, break.\n\nIn Fortran, after modifying c, check if it's >b. So inside the loop, after setting c and incrementing j, check if c >b.\n\nBut the loop condition is mod(c, min(x,y)) !=0 and ans is true. So in the Fortran code, perhaps:\n\nInside the loop, first compute c and j, then check if c exceeds b. If yes, set ans to false and exit the loop.\n\nSo the loop in Fortran would be:\n\nans = .true.\n\nif (c > b) then\n    print *, 0\n    ans = .false.\nend if\n\ndo while (mod(c, min(x,y)) /= 0 .and. ans)\n    if (x > y) then\n        c = x * j\n    else\n        c = y * j\n    end if\n    j = j + 1\n    if (c > b) then\n        print *, 0\n        ans = .false.\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but initially, j is 2. Let's see the Java code:\n\nj starts at 2. Then inside the loop, they set c to x*j (if x>y) or y*j (otherwise), then j increments by 1. Then check if c exceeds b.\n\nSo in Fortran, j is initialized to 2, then inside the loop, multiply x or y by j, then j increases by 1 each time.\n\nYes.\n\nSo variables j is initialized to 2. But in the initial code, j is declared as long j=2. So in Fortran, j = 2_8 (using 8-byte integer).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, j is initialized as 2. So in Fortran:\n\nj = 2\n\nBut since variables are integer(kind=8), better to initialize as 2_8.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nj = 2_8\n\nBut perhaps in the code, the user enters x, y, etc. as 64-bit integers. So all variables should be 64-bit.\n\nNow, after computing c, the code then checks if ans is true. If so, find the first multiple of c >= a, then compute the count.\n\nIn Java:\n\nif (ans) {\n    long count = 0;\n    i = a;\n    for (i = a; i <= b; i++) {\n        if (i % c ==0) break;\n    }\n    if (i != b+1) {\n        System.out.println( ( (b -i)/c ) +1 );\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(0);\n    }\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, this part translates to:\n\nif (ans) then\n    ! Find the first i >= a and i <=b such that mod(i,c) ==0\n    i = a\n    do while (i <= b)\n        if (mod(i, c) == 0) exit\n        i = i + 1\n    end do\n\n    if (i <= b) then\n        count = (b - i) / c + 1\n        print *, count\n    else\n        print *, 0\n    end if\nend if\n\nYes.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let me check for possible errors.\n\nIn the loop where we compute c, after setting c = x * j or y * j, j increments. For example, if x is larger than y, then j starts at 2, so c = x*2, then j becomes 3, next iteration would be x*3, etc. But in the Java code, the loop continues until c is a multiple of the smaller number. So after each step, the new c is checked for divisibility by the min(x,y). So this approach works.\n\nBut wait, for example, if x=6 and y=4. Then max(x,y) is 6. The min is 4. 6 mod 4 is 2. So enter loop. Since x>y, multiply x (6) by j=2 \u2192 12. Check 12 mod 4 is 0 \u2192 exit loop. So c=12. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: x=4, y=6. max is 6, min is4. 6 mod4=2. So enter loop. x<y, so multiply y (6) by j=2 \u219212. 12 mod4=0. So exit. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm correctly computes the LCM.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the variables must be properly initialized.\n\nIn the Java code, 'ans' is initially true. Then if c >b, set ans to false. Then in the loop, if c exceeds b, set ans to false.\n\nSo in Fortran, ans is initialized as .true.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nRead x, y, a, b.\n\nSet c = max(x,y)\n\nCheck if c >b. If yes, print 0 and ans is .false.\n\nIf ans is still true, enter the loop:\n\ndo while (mod(c, min(x,y)) /=0 and ans)\n\nIn each iteration:\n\nMultiply the larger of x and y by j (starting at 2) \u2192 new c.\n\nj increments.\n\nCheck if new c >b. If yes, print 0 and set ans to false.\n\nElse, loop continues until c is a multiple of min(x,y).\n\nOnce c is found (the LCM), then proceed to find the first i >=a that is a multiple of c.\n\nIf found (i <=b), then the count is (b -i)/c +1.\n\nOtherwise, 0.\n\nNow, translating all that into Fortran.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. In Fortran, mod(a,b) returns a positive result if b is positive. But in Java, the modulus can be negative if a is negative. However, in this code, a and b are positive (since they are read from input as such). So no problem.\n\n2. Division in Fortran for integers: (b -i)/c is integer division. But in Fortran, using / with integers truncates towards zero, same as Java. So correct.\n\n3. Handling large numbers. Since the variables are 64-bit integers, it should be okay.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nHere's the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_340_A\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: x, y, a, b, j, c, i, count\nlogical :: ans\n\n! Read input\nread(*,*) x, y, a, b\n\nans = .true.\nc = max(x, y)\n\nif (c > b) then\n    print *, 0\n    ans = .false.\nend if\n\nj = 2_8\n\n! Find LCM\ndo while (mod(c, min(x, y)) /= 0 .and. ans)\n    if (x > y) then\n        c = x * j\n    else\n        c = y * j\n    end if\n    j = j + 1_8\n    if (c > b) then\n        print *, 0\n        ans = .false.\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nif (ans) then\n    ! Find first i >=a divisible by c\n    i = a\n    do while (i <= b)\n        if (mod(i, c) == 0) exit\n        i = i + 1\n    end do\n\n    if (i <= b) then\n        count = (b - i) / c + 1\n        print *, count\n    else\n        print *, 0\n    end if\nend if\n\nend program codeforces_340_A\n\nWait, but in the loop for finding the LCM, after each iteration, we need to check if the new c is divisible by min(x,y). Because the loop condition is checked after each iteration. Wait, in Fortran, the do while loop checks the condition at the beginning. So the code inside the loop will run only if mod(c, min(x,y)) is not zero and ans is true.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nwhile (c % Math.min(x, y) != 0 && ans) { ... }\n\nSo each iteration, after calculating new c, the loop checks again.\n\nSo the Fortran code's do while loop is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the Fortran code, after setting c in the loop (e.g., c = x*j), then j increments, check if c >b. If not, the loop continues. But the next iteration's condition is based on the new c. So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's test the code with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n2 3 6 18\n\nJava code output is 3 (6,12,18).\n\nIn this case, x=2, y=3. c is 3. mod(3, 2) is 1. So enter loop. Since x < y, multiply y=3 by j=2 \u21926. j becomes 3. Check if 6 mod2 ==0 \u2192 yes. So loop exits. c is 6 (the LCM). Then find first i >=6 (a=6). i=6. Then count is (18-6)/6 +1 \u219212/6=2+1=3. So output 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput 2 4 1 4\n\nx=2, y=4. c=4. mod(4, 2)=0. So no loop. ans is true. Then find i >=1. The first i is 4. Then (4-4)/4=0 +1=1. Output 1.\n\nIn Fortran code, the code would correctly compute that.\n\nAnother test case where LCM is found in the loop.\n\nx=3, y=5. a=10, b=20.\n\nc starts as5. mod(5,3)=2. Enter loop. x < y \u2192 multiply y=5 by j=2 \u219210. Check mod(10,3)=1. j increments to 3. Next iteration: multiply by 3 \u219215. mod(15,3)=0. Exit loop. c=15. Then find i >=10. First i is 15. (20-15)/15=0 +1=1. Output 1.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues in Fortran:\n\n- The do while loop for finding i starts at i=a. Then increments by 1. For large ranges, this could be slow, but the original Java code does the same. Since the constraints aren't given, but the user is translating code, it's okay.\n\nSo the Fortran code should work as intended."
