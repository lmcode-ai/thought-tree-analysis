    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The main part seems to be calculating something with a binary search, using a helper function called get, which calculates some value based on the digits of a number.\n\nFirst, let's look at the get function in Java. It takes a long a and returns a long. The logic here seems to be counting the number of digits multiplied by their place values. For example, numbers from 1 to 9 contribute 1 digit each, 10-99 contribute 2 each, and so on. The function calculates the total digits up to a. So, for a number like 123, it would compute 9*1 (for 1-9) + 90*2 (for 10-99) + 24*3 (for 100-123). That makes sense. Now, translating this into Fortran. Fortran uses subroutines or functions. Since the Java function returns a value, I'll make a Fortran function for this.\n\nNext is the binarySearch function. Wait, but looking at the main method, the binarySearch isn't actually called. Oh, right! The main method uses another binary search approach in the loop. The binarySearch function in Java is defined but not used in the main method. So maybe the main part is the binary search loop in the main function. So perhaps the binarySearch function isn't necessary for the translation. Wait, the main function's loop is a binary search between beg and end. Let me check.\n\nIn the Java main:\n\nThey read gen, st, tim. Then gen is divided by tim. Then they set beg to st-1, end to 1e18. Then a loop that performs a binary search where med is calculated as (beg + end)/2 +1. Depending on whether get(med) - get(st-1) is larger than gen, they adjust end or beg. When beg equals end, output the result.\n\nSo the key parts are the get function and the binary search loop.\n\nSo, for the Fortran code, I need to replicate this logic.\n\nFirst, variables: gen, st, tim. Then compute gen = gen / tim. Then perform the binary search loop.\n\nNow, Fortran doesn't have a built-in power function for integers like 10^18, but I can write 1e18 as a real, but since we're dealing with integers, maybe use 10**18. But Fortran's integer kinds might need to handle large numbers. Let's assume we use 8-byte integers (integer*8), which can handle up to 9e18.\n\nSo, variable declarations:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: gen, st, tim, med, beg, end, ans\n\nWait, but in the Java code, ans is a static variable. But in the main function, it's not used except for in the binarySearch function, which is not called. So perhaps ans is irrelevant here. Wait, looking back, the binarySearch function is not called in the main function. So the main loop is doing a different binary search. So maybe the binarySearch function is dead code. Therefore, in the Fortran translation, I can ignore the binarySearch function and focus on the main loop and the get function.\n\nSo the key steps:\n\n1. Translate the get function.\n\n2. Translate the main loop.\n\nLet's start with the get function.\n\nIn Java:\n\npublic static long get(long a) {\n    long ret = 0;\n    long now = 1;\n    long t = 1;\n    for (; ; ) {\n        if (now * 10 > a) {\n            ret += (a - now + 1) * t;\n            break;\n        }\n        ret += now * 9 * t;\n        now *= 10;\n        t++;\n    }\n    return ret;\n}\n\nThis loop calculates the total number of digits when writing all numbers from 1 to a. For each digit length t, starting at 1, it checks if the next power of 10 (now*10) is greater than a. If so, add the remaining numbers (a - now +1) multiplied by t. Otherwise, add 9*now*t (since from now to now*10-1, there are 9*now numbers, each with t digits), then multiply now by 10 and increment t.\n\nIn Fortran, I'll create a function get(a) that returns an integer(kind=8). Let's code this.\n\nfunction get(a) result(ret)\n    integer(kind=8) :: a, ret, now, t\n    ret = 0\n    now = 1\n    t = 1\n    do\n        if (now * 10 > a) then\n            ret = ret + (a - now + 1) * t\n            exit\n        else\n            ret = ret + now * 9 * t\n            now = now * 10\n            t = t + 1\n        end if\n    end do\nend function\n\nNow, in the main program.\n\nThe Java main reads gen, st, tim from input, then does gen = gen / tim. Then starts a binary search between beg and end.\n\nIn Fortran, reading input. Java uses Scanner, which reads from stdin. In Fortran, we can read using read(*,*) variables.\n\nThen, the loop is:\n\nbeg = st - 1\nend = 1e18 (but as integer)\nloop until beg == end:\n    med = (beg + end)/2 + 1\n    compute get(med) - get(st-1) and compare with gen\n    adjust beg or end accordingly\nWhen loop ends, output beg - st +1.\n\nWait, but in Java, (beg + end) /2 +1 might be equivalent to med = (beg + end +1)/2, which is the upper middle to avoid infinite loops in binary search. Because in Java, integer division truncates. So (beg + end)/2 is floor division.\n\nBut in Fortran, integer division with / is truncating towards zero. So (beg + end)/2 would be the same as in Java. Then adding 1 gives med as (beg + end)/2 +1.\n\nBut perhaps in Fortran, med = (beg + end + 1) / 2. Because (beg + end)/2 +1 is the same as (beg + end +2)/2. Wait, maybe not. Let's see: if (beg + end) is even or odd?\n\nWait, for example, if beg=1, end=3. (1+3)/2 = 2. Then med = 2 +1 =3. So med would be (1+3+1)/2 = 2.5, but as integer division, that's 2. So maybe not. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the Java code uses med = (beg + end)/2 +1. For example, when beg + end is even, (beg + end)/2 is exact, then adding 1. So for example, if beg=1, end=3: (1+3)/2=2, med=3. Then med becomes (1+3+1)/2=2.5 truncated to 2? Wait no, in Java, (1+3) is 4, divided by 2 is 2 (integer division), plus 1 is 3. So med is 3.\n\nIn Fortran, (beg + end)/2 would be 2 (since 4/2=2), then adding 1 gives 3. So same result.\n\nBut if beg and end are such that (beg + end) is odd. Like beg=1, end=4. Then (1+4)/2=2 (since 5/2=2 in integer division), plus 1=3. So med=3.\n\nSo the Fortran code can do med = (beg + end)/2 +1.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you do integer division, like (a + b)/2, if a + b is odd, it truncates towards zero. For example, (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5 becomes 2. So adding 1 gives 3.\n\nSo the code for med in Fortran would be med = (beg + end)/2 + 1.\n\nNow, the loop condition in Java is a while(true) loop, and breaks when beg == end.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps a do loop with exit when beg == end.\n\nBut the loop runs until beg and end meet. Let's structure it as:\n\nbeg = st - 1\nend = 1e18_8  ! using 8-byte integer\ndo\n    if (beg == end) exit\n    med = (beg + end)/2 + 1\n    ! compute get(med) - get(st-1)\n    current = get(med) - get(st-1)\n    if (current > gen) then\n        end = med -1\n    else\n        beg = med\n    endif\nend do\n\nThen, after the loop, print beg - st +1.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the 1e18 may need to be written as a 8-byte integer. So 10**18_8.\n\nBut 10**18 is 1000000000000000000, which is larger than the maximum 8-byte integer (which is 9223372036854775807). Oh wait, 1e18 is 1 followed by 18 zeros. 1e18 is 10^18, which is 1000000000000000000, which is larger than 9e18 (which is the max 8-byte signed integer? Wait, the maximum 64-bit signed integer is 2^63 -1 = 9223372036854775807, which is approximately 9.2e18. So 1e19 is larger than that. But 1e18 is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is less than 9.2e18, so it can be stored in an 8-byte integer. Wait 1e18 is 10^18 = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000. Which is 10^18 is 1 followed by 18 zeros. Let's see: 2^60 is about 1.15e18, 2^63 is 9.2e18, so 1e18 is less than that. So 1e18 can fit into 8-byte integer. So in Fortran, end = 10**18_8.\n\nBut in Fortran, 10**18 is written as 10_8**18, perhaps, but need to use 8-byte integers. So better to compute end as 10**18, but in 8-byte. So in Fortran, I can write end = 10_8**18.\n\nBut 10**18 is 1000000000000000000, which is 1e18. So end is initialized as 10^18.\n\nNow, the variables in Fortran need to be declared with integer(kind=8) to handle such large numbers.\n\nSo, the main program steps:\n\nRead gen, st, tim from input.\n\nThen gen = gen / tim.\n\nBut in Java, gen is a long, so division is integer division. So in Fortran, gen = gen / tim, but using integer division. So in Fortran, we can use gen = gen / tim, since gen and tim are integers.\n\nThen, the binary search loop as discussed.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nIn Fortran, the code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8) :: gen, st, tim, beg, end, med\n    integer(kind=8) :: get\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) gen, st, tim\n\n    gen = gen / tim\n\n    beg = st - 1\n    end = 10_8**18\n\n    do\n        if (beg == end) exit\n\n        med = (beg + end)/2 + 1\n\n        if (get(med) - get(st-1) > gen) then\n            end = med - 1\n        else\n            beg = med\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, beg - st + 1\n\ncontains\n\n    function get(a) result(ret)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: a\n        integer(kind=8) :: ret, now, t\n        ret = 0\n        now = 1\n        t = 1\n        do\n            if (now * 10 > a) then\n                ret = ret + (a - now + 1) * t\n                exit\n            else\n                ret = ret + now * 9 * t\n                now = now * 10\n                t = t + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n    end function get\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you have a function inside a program, you need to declare its type. But in this case, since get is a contained function (inside the contains section), the interface is known. So this should work.\n\nTesting this code for possible issues.\n\nFor example, when a=0, but in the code, a starts from 1? Well, in the main code, st can be 1, and st-1 is 0. Then get(0) would be called. Let's see what the get function returns for a=0.\n\nIn the get function:\n\nnow starts at 1. Then now*10 is 10, which is larger than a=0. So (0 -1 +1)*t = 0 *1=0. So ret=0. So get(0) returns 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: if st=1, then st-1=0. get(med) - get(0) is the total digits from 1 to med.\n\nAnother possible problem: large numbers. Using 8-byte integers should handle up to 9e18, which is sufficient.\n\nSo this code should be correct."
