    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first, I'll look at what the Java code does. So, it reads H, W, A, B from input. Then checks if W is less than 2*A or H less than 2*B. If so, output -1. Otherwise, it creates a grid where certain positions are 0 or 1 based on the conditions.\n\nSo the first part is handling the input. In Java, they use a Scanner. In Fortran, we'll read using read(*,*) statements. Then, the condition check. If the condition is met, output -1. Otherwise, generate the grid.\n\nThe main loop is for i from 0 to H-1, and j from 0 to W-1. The condition is (i < B and j < A) OR (i >= B and j >= A). Then write 0 else 1. Then a new line after each row.\n\nWait, Fortran uses 1-based indexing by default, but the Java code uses 0-based. So the loops in Fortran should start from 0 to H-1? Or maybe adjust the loop variables. Let's think: in Java, i runs from 0 to H-1 (since i < H). So in Fortran, perhaps do i = 0, H-1. Similarly for j.\n\nFortran's do loops can handle that. But Fortran's variables need to be declared. So we'll have to declare H, W, A, B as integers.\n\nNow, the output part. Java writes to BufferedWriter, which is efficient. In Fortran, we can write to the console using print statements, or format strings.\n\nWait, the Java code outputs each line as a string of 0s and 1s. So for each row, construct a string and then print it. In Fortran, perhaps we can create a character array for each line, then print it.\n\nAlternatively, for each j in the row, write the character, then after the loop, print a new line. But writing each character individually might be slow, but for the purposes here, it's manageable.\n\nBut Fortran's formatted output can handle this. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, create a character variable for each line. Initialize it as a string of length W, then set each position to '0' or '1', then print the line.\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are fixed-length. So perhaps for each row, create a character array of length W, set each element, then write as a format.\n\nWait, for each row, build a string. Let's say we have a line variable, line(W), each character is either '0' or '1'. Then, after filling the line, print it.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 0, H-1\n  line = ' '  ! Initialize to spaces?\n  do j = 0, W-1\n    if ((i < B .and. j < A) .or. (i >= B .and. j >= A)) then\n      line(j+1:j+1) = '0'  ! Because Fortran is 1-based\n    else\n      line(j+1:j+1) = '1'\n    endif\n  end do\n  print *, line\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, if j starts at 0, then for j+1, the first position is 1, which is correct. But line has to be a string of length W. So declare line as character(len=W).\n\nBut how to handle that. Let's see:\n\nFor each row, create a character variable of length W. Then, for each column (0 to W-1), set the j+1 position to '0' or '1'.\n\nYes. So, in code:\n\ncharacter(len=W) :: line\n\nBut wait, W is a variable, so in Fortran, you can't have a character with length determined at runtime unless you use allocatable or other methods. Oh right, Fortran requires that the length of a character variable be a constant unless it is allocatable. So to handle dynamic length, we need to use an allocatable character variable.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(:), allocatable :: line\n\nThen, allocate it with length W.\n\nBut in Fortran 2003 and later, this is possible. So in the code, after reading H and W, we can do:\n\nallocate(character(W) :: line)\n\nBut for each row, perhaps we can re-allocate? Or better, allocate once before the loop.\n\nWait, the line length is W, which is fixed once H and W are read. So allocate once:\n\nallocate(character(W) :: line)\n\nThen, for each row, loop through j from 0 to W-1, set the j+1 character.\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, read H, W, A, B.\n\nCheck if (W < 2*A) .or. (H < 2*B). If so, print -1 and stop.\n\nElse, proceed to generate the grid.\n\nThen, loop over each row (i from 0 to H-1), then for each j from 0 to W-1, check the condition.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFortran code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: H, W, A, B, i, j\n    character(:), allocatable :: line\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) H, W, A, B\n\n    ! Check condition\n    if (W < 2*A .or. H < 2*B) then\n        print *, -1\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    ! Allocate line with length W\n    allocate(character(W) :: line)\n\n    ! Generate each row\n    do i = 0, H-1\n        do j = 0, W-1\n            if ( (i < B .and. j < A) .or. (i >= B .and. j >= A) ) then\n                line(j+1:j+1) = '0'\n            else\n                line(j+1:j+1) = '1'\n            end if\n        end do\n        print '(A)', line\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(line)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you do 'print '(A)', line', it will print the entire line, which is of length W, and since each character is set, that's correct.\n\nTesting the condition: Let's see. For example, when i < B (i starts at 0) and j < A, then '0'. Also, if i >= B (so B <= i < H) and j >= A (A <= j < W), then '0' as well. Else '1'.\n\nYes, that's the same as the Java code.\n\nNow, possible issues: The Java code uses 0-based indices for i and j. The Fortran code uses 0-based in the loops (i=0 to H-1, j=0 to W-1) so the conditions are the same.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the 'do' loop variables can start and end with any integers. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: When W or H is 0, but according to the problem statement, perhaps inputs are positive integers. The original Java code didn't handle that, so the Fortran code also doesn't.\n\nSo this should be the correct translation."
