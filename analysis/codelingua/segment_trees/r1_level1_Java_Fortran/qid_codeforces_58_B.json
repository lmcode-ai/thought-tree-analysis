    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The program reads an integer n from the input, then prints out a sequence of numbers starting with n. Each subsequent number is the largest divisor of the previous number that's smaller than it. For example, if n is 10, the output would be 10 5 1 (since 5 divides 10, then 1 divides 5, and we stop at 1). Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. The loop starts from n-1 down to 1. For each i, if m (starting as n) is divisible by i, then print i, set m to i. So for n=10, the first m is 10. Then i starts at 9, but 10%9 is not 0. Then i=8, no. i=5: 10%5=0, so print 5, m becomes 5. Next iteration, i is 4, 5%4=1. Then i=3, same. i=2, no. i=1: 5%1=0, print 1, m becomes 1. Then the loop ends. So the output would be 10 5 1. So the code is finding the largest proper divisors in sequence until it reaches 1.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, reading an integer from input. In Java, they use Scanner. In Fortran, we can read using read(*,*) n. Then print n followed by a space. Then m is initialized to n. Then loop from i = n-1 down to 1. For each i, check if m mod i is 0. If yes, print i, and set m to i. Then continue the loop.\n\nSo in Fortran, how to handle the loop? The loop structure in Fortran is do loop. But since we need to loop from n-1 down to 1, step -1. So do i = n-1, 1, -1. Then inside the loop, check if mod(m, i) == 0. If so, print i and set m = i.\n\nBut in Fortran, the print statement adds a newline by default. In the Java code, each print is with a space and then a newline. Wait, Java's println adds a newline. So in the Java code, each number is printed on a separate line. Wait, no: in Java, the code does System.out.println(n + \" \"); So that's n followed by a space and then a newline. Then each subsequent print is System.out.println(i + \" \"); which is i, space, newline. So each number is printed on its own line, followed by a space. Wait, maybe the output is each number on a line, but with a trailing space. For example, when n is 10, the output is:\n\n10 \n5 \n1 \n\nBut perhaps the user wants each number printed on the same line, separated by spaces. Wait, looking at the Java code again: the first print is n + \" \" and then println. Wait, no, System.out.println adds a newline. So in Java, the first line prints n followed by a space and then a newline. Then each subsequent i is printed similarly. So each number is on its own line, but with a trailing space. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake, but that's what the code does. So the Fortran code should replicate that behavior.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you use print *, the default is to add a space between items and a newline. For example, print *, n, \" \" would print n followed by a space and a newline. Wait, but in Fortran, if you do print *, n, \" \", it's equivalent to printing n, then a space, then a new line. Because each item in the print statement is output with a space separator, and the whole line ends with a newline. So in Java, the code is printing a line with n followed by a space and a newline. So in Fortran, the equivalent would be to print n and a space, then a newline. Which can be done with print '(I0, \" \")', n. Wait, but the format might need to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Java code's output is each number on a separate line, each with a space at the end. So in Fortran, to replicate that, each number is printed with a trailing space, followed by a newline. So the first line is n followed by a space, then a newline. Then each subsequent i is the same. So in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nprint *, n, ' '  ! But this adds two spaces, perhaps. Wait, the first item is n, then a space. The print statement with * uses list-directed formatting. For example, print *, n, ' ' would output the value of n, then a space, then a newline. Because in list-directed output, each item is separated by a space. Wait, no. List-directed output (using *) adds a space between items. So print *, n, ' ' would print n, followed by a space (from the list-directed separator), then the ' ', which is another space. So between n and the space there are two spaces. Hmm. That's not desired.\n\nAlternatively, using a format string. For example, print '(I0, A)', n, ' ' would print n followed by a space, then a newline. Because the format I0 prints the integer without leading spaces, then A prints the ' ' (a single space). Then the line ends with a newline. So that would be correct. Then for each subsequent number, do the same. So the first print is n followed by a space and newline, then each i is printed the same way.\n\nSo the Fortran code structure would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_58_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, i\n    read(*,*) n\n    print '(I0, A)', n, ' '\n    m = n\n    do i = n-1, 1, -1\n        if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n            print '(I0, A)', i, ' '\n            m = i\n        end if\n    end do\nend program codeforces_58_B\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the initial print, the loop starts from n-1 and checks if m % i == 0. So in Fortran, mod(m, i) gives the remainder. If that's zero, then i divides m.\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop is from n-1 down to 1. So the code should loop i from n-1 to 1, step -1.\n\nTesting with n=10:\n\nFirst, print 10 followed by space and newline. m=10. Then i starts at 9. mod(10,9)=1 !=0. i=8: mod(10,8)=2. i=7: 3. i=6:4. i=5:0. So yes. Print 5, set m=5. Then next i=4. mod(5,4)=1. i=3: mod(5,3)=2. i=2:1. i=1: mod(5,1)=0. So print 1, set m=1. Then loop ends. So output is:\n\n10 \n5 \n1 \n\nWhich matches the Java code's output.\n\nSo the Fortran code should work as intended."
