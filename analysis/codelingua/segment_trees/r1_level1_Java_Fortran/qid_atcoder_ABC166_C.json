    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. \n\nSo, the Java program reads N and M. Then reads N values into H array. It initializes an ans array of booleans, all set to true. Then for M pairs of integers, it compares the corresponding H values. Depending on the comparison, it sets the ans entries to false. Finally, it counts how many entries in ans are still true and outputs that count.\n\nHmm, Fortran. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, variable declarations. In Java, N is an int, M is a long. But in Fortran, I'll use integer for both. Wait, but in Java, M is read as a long, but in the code, M is used in a loop that runs M times, so maybe it's okay to use integer in Fortran. Because M is up to 1e18 or something? No, the problem probably expects M to fit in a regular integer. But maybe in the original code, M is a long for some reason. Wait, in Java, Scanner's nextLong() reads a 64-bit integer, but in Fortran, the default integer might be 32-bit. But if M is up to 1e5 or similar, 32-bit is enough. Let me check the problem statement. Oh, since it's from AtCoder's ABC166 problem C, the constraints are likely N up to 1e5 and M up to 1e5 as well. So using integer in Fortran is okay.\n\nSo in Fortran, N and M can be integers. Then H is an array of long integers. Wait, in Java, H is a long array. So in Fortran, H can be an integer array, but maybe using 8-byte integers. Let's use integer(8) for H. Or maybe the problem allows H to be regular integers. The problem says \"H_i is the height of the i-th observatory\", but heights can be large. So to match Java's long, which is 64-bit, Fortran's integer(8) would be appropriate.\n\nThe ans array in Java is a boolean array. In Fortran, we can use a logical array.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read N and M.\n2. Read H array of size N.\n3. Initialize ans array to .true.\n4. Read M pairs of integers, each pair temp1 and temp2.\n   For each pair, compare H[temp1-1] and H[temp2-1]. Then set ans[temp1-1] and ans[temp2-1] accordingly.\n5. Count the number of .true. in ans and print.\n\nNow, in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default. So when the Java code uses temp1-1, in Fortran, since the array starts at 1, we can directly use temp1 and temp2. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, in Java, H is 0-based. So when the input gives temp1, which is 1-based in the problem's input (probably), the code subtracts 1 to get the 0-based index. So in Fortran, the input temp1 is the 1-based index of the observatory, so the array in Fortran is 1-based, so we don't need to subtract 1. So in the Java code, when temp1 is read, it's converted to 0-based. In Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the code would use H(temp1) directly.\n\nWait, let me check the code. For example, the Java code does:\n\nH[temp1 - 1]\n\nBecause the observatory numbers are 1-based in the input, and the Java array is 0-based. So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then temp1 is the index. So in Fortran, we can just use H(temp1).\n\nSo for the input, when we read temp1 and temp2, they are 1-based indices in the problem's input. So in Fortran, those indices can be used directly as array indices.\n\nSo the code in Fortran would process each pair as:\n\nIf H(temp1) < H(temp2), then ans(temp1) = .false.\n\nElse if H(temp1) > H(temp2), ans(temp2) = .false.\n\nElse, both ans(temp1) and ans(temp2) = .false.\n\nSo that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, how to read the input.\n\nIn Java, the code uses Scanner to read N, M. Then reads H as N longs. Then M pairs of integers.\n\nIn Fortran, reading can be done with READ(*,*) statements.\n\nBut for large inputs, using formatted reads can be slow, but for code translation purposes, we can proceed.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead N and M as integers.\n\nThen read N values into H array. H is declared as integer(8), dimension(N).\n\nThen initialize ans as a logical array of size N, all .true.\n\nThen loop M times, each time read temp1 and temp2. Then perform the comparisons and set ans entries.\n\nFinally, count the number of .true. in ans and print.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. Fortran's logical array initialization: ans = .true. can be done via ans = .true. but for an array, in Fortran, you can assign it in a loop or using array constructors.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code would be:\n\ninteger :: N, M\ninteger(8), allocatable :: H(:)\nlogical, allocatable :: ans(:)\n\nread(*,*) N, M\nallocate(H(N), ans(N))\ndo i = 1, N\n    read(*,*) H(i)\n    ans(i) = .true.\nend do\n\nThen read M lines, each with temp1 and temp2:\n\ndo i = 1, M\n    read(*,*) temp1, temp2\n    if (H(temp1) < H(temp2)) then\n        ans(temp1) = .false.\n    else if (H(temp1) > H(temp2)) then\n        ans(temp2) = .false.\n    else\n        ans(temp1) = .false.\n        ans(temp2) = .false.\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen count the number of .true. in ans:\n\nans2 = 0\ndo i = 1, N\n    if (ans(i)) ans2 = ans2 + 1\nend do\nprint *, ans2\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Fortran, the variables need to be declared. Let's declare temp1 and temp2 as integers.\n\nPotential gotchas:\n\n- The variables should be declared with the right types.\n\nIn Fortran, when reading into variables, the types must match. So temp1 and temp2 are integers.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo the Fortran code would be something like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC166_C\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, M, i, temp1, temp2, ans2\n    integer(8), allocatable :: H(:)\n    logical, allocatable :: ans(:)\n    \n    read(*,*) N, M\n    allocate(H(N), ans(N))\n    \n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*,*) H(i)\n        ans(i) = .true.\n    end do\n    \n    do i = 1, M\n        read(*,*) temp1, temp2\n        if (H(temp1) < H(temp2)) then\n            ans(temp1) = .false.\n        else if (H(temp1) > H(temp2)) then\n            ans(temp2) = .false.\n        else\n            ans(temp1) = .false.\n            ans(temp2) = .false.\n        end if\n    end do\n    \n    ans2 = 0\n    do i = 1, N\n        if (ans(i)) ans2 = ans2 + 1\n    end do\n    print *, ans2\n    \n    deallocate(H, ans)\nend program atcoder_ABC166_C\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read input, each read(*,*) reads a line. So if the H array is read in a single line, then the code may not work. But the original Java code uses Scanner, which reads tokens, so as long as the input is properly formatted with whitespace, it's okay. The Fortran code's read statements will read the numbers as per the input, regardless of line breaks, assuming that the input is correct. So in the problem's test cases, if the H array is provided in a single line or multiple lines, the code should work.\n\nAnother thing: in Java, the code uses long for H. So in Fortran, H is declared as integer(8), which is 8-byte integers (equivalent to Java's long).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the correct translation."
