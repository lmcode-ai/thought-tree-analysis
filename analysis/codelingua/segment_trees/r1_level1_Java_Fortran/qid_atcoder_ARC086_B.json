    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. \n\nSo the code reads an integer n and an array a of n integers. Then it finds the index m of the element with the maximum absolute value. Then it builds a list of operations (strings) in r. \n\nThe first loop adds operations where elements with opposite signs are modified by adding the value of the maximum element. Then, depending on whether the maximum element is positive or negative, it either adds all elements from the front to make them positive or from the back to make them negative. Finally, it prints the number of operations and each operation.\n\nHmm. So in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, reading input. In Java, they use Scanner. In Fortran, I'll read from standard input using READ statements. The first input is n, then an array of n integers. \n\nThen, finding m: the index of the element with the maximum absolute value. In Java, the loop starts from index 1 (since arrays are 0-based). Wait, the Java code initializes m as 0, then loops from i=1 to n-1. So in Fortran, which is 1-based, the loop should start from i=2 to n. So m starts at 1, then compare abs(a(i)) with abs(a(m)).\n\nNext, the first part of building r: for each element, if the sign of a[m] and a[i] are opposite (a[m] >=0 XOR a[i] >=0), then add the operation. So in Fortran, check if (a(m) >=0 .neqv. a(i) >=0). Then, the indices in the output are 1-based in Java, so same as Fortran. So the operation is m followed by i, but in the code, they add m+1 and i+1 because Java uses 0-based. Wait, no: the Java code uses m + 1 and i +1 because the array is 0-based, so in Fortran, which is 1-based, m and i are already correct. So the Java code's a has indices 0..n-1, so m is 0-based, and when adding to the output, they do m+1 and i+1. But in Fortran, since m and i are 1-based, those would be correct. So in the Fortran code, when adding to the list, just m and i.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array a is 0-based, so m is the index in 0-based. Then when constructing the operation strings, they add m+1 and i+1. For example, if m is 0 (first element), the output is 1. So in Fortran, since the indices are 1-based, we can just use m and i directly. So that part would be different.\n\nSo the first part of the Java code is:\n\nfor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   if (a[m] >=0 XOR a[i] >=0):\n\n       add (m+1) + \" \" + (i+1)\n\nIn Fortran, since m and i are 1-based, the code would check for each i from 1 to n, and if the sign is different, add m and i.\n\nSo the first loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if ( (a(m) >=0 .neqv. a(i) >=0) ) then\n\n       add to the list: m, i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, depending on whether a(m) is positive or negative, the next part. If a(m) is positive, then for i from 1 to n-1, add operations i and i+1. But wait, the Java code's loop is for (int i=1; i <n; ++i) which is 0-based indices, so i runs from 1 to n-2 (if n is the original n). Wait, original code:\n\nIf a[m] is positive:\n\n   for (int i=1; i <n; ++i) r.add(i + \" \" + (i+1));\n\nWait, Java's indices here are 0-based? Wait, no. The loop is i from 1 to n-1 (since i <n, starts at 1). Then adding i and i+1. Wait, no, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=1; i <n; ++i), so i starts at 1 (0-based?), but in the code, the array has length n. So for example, if n=5, i runs from 1 to 4 (since i <5). Then, the added strings are i followed by i+1. Wait, but in 0-based terms, the elements are from 0 to 4. So i here is 1, 2, 3,4. So adding (i) and (i+1) would be 1 and 2, etc. Wait, perhaps the code is using 1-based indices here? No, that's confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe Java code's array is 0-based, but the code for building the operations when a[m] is positive is adding pairs like i followed by i+1, where i starts from 1 and goes up to n-1. Wait, n is the number of elements. So, for example, if n=5 elements (indices 0-4), the loop i runs from 1 to 4 (since i <n). Then the operations are \"i\" and \"i+1\", which would be 1 and 2, 2 and 3, etc. But the elements are 0-based. So this seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the code is adding 1-based indices here.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nIf a[m] is positive:\n\n   for (int i=1; i <n; ++i) r.add(i + \" \" + (i + 1));\n\nWait, i is 1-based? Because in the Java code, the array is 0-based, but here the code is adding 1-based indices. Because the first element is index 0, but here i starts at 1. So the first operation is 1 followed by 2, which refers to the second and third elements in the array. That seems like a mistake.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when a[m] is positive, the code appends operations that add each element to the next, starting from the first element (i=0 in the array). Wait, maybe I need to re-express the code.\n\nWait, the code for when a[m] is positive:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <n; ++i) r.add(i + \" \" + (i+1));\n\nWait, i starts at 1 (in Java, which is 0-based?), but in this loop, the code is adding i and i+1. For example, if n is 5, then i runs from 1 to 4, and the operations are 1 2, 2 3, 3 4, 4 5. Wait, but the array is 0-based, so the elements are 0-4. So the code seems to be adding 1-based indices here. So perhaps the code is generating the list of operations as 1-based indices, even though the array is 0-based. That's possible. Because in the first part, when they add m+1 and i+1, they are converting from 0-based to 1-based. Then, in the loops where they add the operations for same sign elements, they are using 1-based indices. So when the array is 0-based, the indices are 1-based in the output.\n\nSo in the Java code, the output is 1-based. So for example, when a[m] is positive, the loop adds operations from 1 to n-1 (Java i runs from 1 to n-1), which correspond to the 0-based indices 0 to n-2. But in the code, the added operations are i and i+1, which are 1-based. So for n=5 elements, the loop runs from i=1 to i=4 (0-based?), no. Wait, the code is written as:\n\nIf a[m] >=0, then:\n\n   for (int i=1; i <n; ++i) r.add(i + \" \" + (i+1));\n\nWait, in Java, the loop variable i starts at 1 and goes up to n-1 (since i <n). So for example, if n is 5, i is 1, 2, 3,4. So the operations added are \"1 2\", \"2 3\", \"3 4\", \"4 5\". But the array has 5 elements (indices 0-4). So these operations are adding elements 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4? Because in 1-based numbering, 1 would correspond to index 0. So this seems like a confusion between 0-based and 1-based indices.\n\nWait, but the output in the Java code is the list of operations, where the numbers are 1-based. So in the code, when the a[m] is positive, the code is adding operations to apply the following: for each element from the first to the second last, add the current element to the next. So, for example, after the first part (the XOR operations), the array is all positive. Then, to propagate the maximum (positive) value to all elements, the code does a chain from the first to the last element. So each step adds the previous element to the next, thus making each element the sum of all previous elements up to that point. That would result in all elements being the same as the maximum. So the operations are 1 2, 2 3, etc., which in 1-based indices. So in Fortran, since the array is 1-based, these indices are correct. So in Fortran, when a(m) is positive, the code would add operations for i from 1 to n-1, each being (i, i+1). Similarly, if a(m) is negative, add from n down to 2, (i, i-1).\n\nSo, for the loop when a(m) is positive:\n\nIn Java, for (i=1; i <n; ++i) adds operations 1 2, 2 3, ..., n-1 n. So in Fortran, since the array is 1-based, the loop would be from i=1 to n-1, adding (i, i+1). Which is the same as the Java code's output. So the code in Fortran would be:\n\nif (a(m) >=0) then\n\n    do i = 1, n-1\n\n        add (i, i+1) to r\n\nelse\n\n    do i = n, 2, -1\n\n        add (i, i-1) to r\n\nSo the loops are straightforward.\n\nNow, how to handle the list of operations. In Java, it's an ArrayList of Strings. In Fortran, we can use an array of strings, but since we don't know the size upfront, perhaps using a list structure. However, Fortran doesn't have dynamic lists, so we need to preallocate an array that can be large enough. The maximum possible number of operations is n-1 (from the first loop) plus (n-1) from the second part. So for the first loop, each element could be added (if opposite sign). The worst case is when all elements except m are of opposite sign. Then the first part adds n-1 operations. Then the second part adds n-1 operations. So total 2n-2 operations. So preallocating an array of size 2n.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, the first part could have up to n-1 operations. So maximum size is (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-2. So preallocate an array of size 2n, then track the count.\n\nAlternatively, we can first compute the count and then create the array, but that's more complex. Probably easier to preallocate.\n\nSo, in Fortran code:\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, read a as an array of size n.\n\nFind m as the index of the maximum absolute value.\n\nCompute the first part: for each i from 1 to n, check if sign is different. If so, add operation m i.\n\nCompute the count of these operations. Then, compute the second part: either n-1 operations (if a(m) is positive) or n-1 operations (if negative). So total maximum is (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-2.\n\nBut in practice, the first part could have k operations, and the second part n-1, so total k + (n-1). So we can preallocate an array of size 2n to be safe.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n, read a(1..n).\n\n2. Find m: index of element with maximum absolute value.\n\n3. Generate the first set of operations (opposite signs) and store in a list.\n\n4. Generate the second set of operations (propagate the maximum).\n\n5. Output the total number of operations and each operation.\n\nNow, how to represent the list of operations. Each operation is a string, like 'm i' where m and i are integers.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps store the operations in a character array, where each element is a string of length, say, 20 (enough to hold two integers and a space). Then, keep track of the current count.\n\nAlternatively, build the list as a list of strings, but since Fortran has static arrays, perhaps use a preallocated array and track the count.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nprogram arc086b\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, m, i, cnt\n\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n    character(len=20), allocatable :: r(:)\n\n    integer :: max_abs, tmp\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    allocate(a(n))\n\n    read(*,*) a\n\n    ! Find m (1-based index) with maximum absolute value\n\n    m = 1\n\n    max_abs = abs(a(1))\n\n    do i = 2, n\n\n        if (abs(a(i)) > max_abs) then\n\n            max_abs = abs(a(i))\n\n            m = i\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Now generate the first part of operations\n\n    cnt = 0\n\n    allocate(r(2*n)) ! maximum possible size\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        if ( (a(m) >=0 .neqv. a(i)>=0) ) then\n\n            cnt = cnt +1\n\n            write(r(cnt), '(I0, \" \", I0)') m, i\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Generate the second part\n\n    if (a(m) >=0) then\n\n        do i = 1, n-1\n\n            cnt = cnt +1\n\n            write(r(cnt), '(I0, \" \", I0)') i, i+1\n\n        end do\n\n    else\n\n        do i = n, 2, -1\n\n            cnt = cnt +1\n\n            write(r(cnt), '(I0, \" \", I0)') i, i-1\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Output\n\n    print*, cnt\n\n    do i =1, cnt\n\n        print*, trim(r(i))\n\n    end do\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you use write with a format, you need to have the correct format. For example, when writing two integers, the format could be (2I0) but then separated by a space. Alternatively, '(I0, \" \", I0)' as used above.\n\nBut let me check: for m=3, i=5, the string would be '3 5' which is correct.\n\nBut when writing to a character variable, the length of the variable must be sufficient. For example, if m and i are up to 10^5, then each integer could be up to 5 or 6 digits. So using len=20 should suffice. But in the code above, when allocating r as 2n elements, each of len=20. So the code would need to have:\n\ncharacter(len=20), allocatable :: r(:)\n\nThen, when writing to r(cnt), it would be filled up to the required length.\n\nAnother thing: when the code reads the array a, the Java code uses Arrays.setAll(a, i -> s.nextInt()); which reads n integers. In Fortran, read(*,*) a reads all the integers on the same line or subsequent lines. So assuming that the input is provided as a single line for the array. If the input has the array elements split across lines, this may not work, but per typical programming contest inputs, it's likely that the array is given on a single line after n.\n\nAnother point: the Java code's first part loops through all elements, including m itself. But when i = m, the condition (a[m] >=0 XOR a[i] >=0) is false, so no operation is added. So in Fortran, the loop from 1 to n includes m, but the condition will skip it. So that's okay.\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n-2 -4 3\n\nJava code:\n\nThe maximum absolute value is 4 (element at index 1 (0-based in Java). So m=1 in Java, but in Fortran, it's 2 (since 1-based). Then, for each element, check if sign is different from a(m). a(m) is -4. So elements with positive signs are the third element (3). So in the first part, add (2,3). Then since a(m) is negative, the second part adds operations 3 2, then 2 1. So the operations are:\n\nFirst part: 2 3\n\nSecond part: 3 2, 2 1\n\nTotal 3 operations.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n3\n\n2 3\n\n3 2\n\n2 1\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample from the problem:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 1\n\nMaximum absolute is 1, any of them. Suppose m=1. All elements are positive. So first part has no operations (since all are same sign). Then second part adds 1 2. So output is 1 followed by 1 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the Fortran code seems correct.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n- The allocation of r as size 2n may be overkill, but in practice, it's acceptable.\n\n- The format string when writing to r(cnt) uses '(I0, \" \", I0)' which should produce the required strings.\n\n- Fortran's .neqv. operator is used correctly for the sign check.\n\nSo I think this code should work."
