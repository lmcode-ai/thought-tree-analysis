So in the code, during each iteration, sometimes a character is printed, sometimes not. So building the output as a string could be possible, but the original Java code prints as it goes, which is straightforward. So using the advance='no' option in Fortran's write statements to mimic this. But Fortran's output can sometimes buffer the output, and the advance='no' can be used to prevent line breaks. Let's try to code that. Initialize s_flag to .FALSE. Then, loop over each character:\n\nif (c == '.') then\n    if (s_flag) then\n        print '1', advance='no'\n        s_flag = .false.\n    else\n        print '0', advance='no'\n    end if\nelse if (c == '-') then\n    if (s_flag) then\n        print '2', advance='no'\n        s_flag = .false. else\n        s_flag = .true.\n    end if\nend if\n\nWait, but the 'else' part is for the '-', right? So code structure in Fortran:\n\nlogical :: s_flag\ns_flag = .false. do i = 1, len_trim(input) c = input(i:i)\n    if (c == '.') then\n        if (s_flag) then\n            write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '1'\n            s_flag = .false.\n        else\n            write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '0'\n        end if\n    else  ! assume it's '-'\n        if (s_flag) then\n            write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '2'\n            s_flag = .false. else\n            s_flag = .true.\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Java, the else clause corresponds to when the character is not '.', which in the Java code is checking for '-', but the code actually uses an else clause. So the original code's else is when the character is not '.', which in the problem's context would be '-', since the input is composed of '.' and '-'. So in Fortran, the code can safely check for '.' and else assume it's '-'. But perhaps better to have an explicit check.",

But if you write a zero-length string with advance='no', nothing. Hmm, perhaps to flush the buffer, write a single space with advance='no'? Not sure. Alternatively, since the problem's test cases expect the output to match exactly, perhaps the Fortran code's approach of writing each character with advance='no' and letting the program's termination flush the buffer is sufficient.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm. Let me first understand what the Java code does.\n\nThe Java code reads a string input, processes each character, and outputs some digits based on whether the character is '.' or '-'. There's a boolean variable 's' that acts as a flag. Let me walk through the code logic.\n\nSo, the input is a string composed of '.' and '-'. For each character in the string:\n\n- If the character is '.', then:\n  - If 's' is true, print 1 and set 's' to false.\n  - Else, print 0 (since 's' was already false).\n  \n- If the character is '-', then:\n  - If 's' is true, print 2 and set 's' to false.\n  - Else, set 's' to true (meaning the next character will determine if it's part of a two-character code).\n\nSo the logic is that '-' can be part of a two-character code (like '--' becomes 2?), but wait no, in the code, every '-' checks the 's' flag. So, for example:\n\nWhen a '-' is encountered and 's' is false, we set 's' to true. Then, the next character is either '.' or '-'. If it's a '.', then we print 1 (since 's' was true). If it's another '-', then we print 2. So each pair of '-' followed by something determines a 1 or 2, and a single '.' is 0. \n\nSo the input is like a sequence of Morse-like codes where '.' is 0, '-.' is 1, and '--' is 2. So the code translates the input string into the corresponding digits.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, read the input string. In Java, they read it using Scanner.next(). In Fortran, we can read the input as a character variable.\n\nThen, loop through each character in the string. In Java, it's using a for loop with the length of the array. In Fortran, we can loop from 1 to the length of the string, accessing each character via index.\n\nThe boolean 's' in Java can be represented as a logical variable in Fortran. Let's call it 's_flag' maybe. Initialize it to .FALSE. at the start.\n\nFor each character in the string:\n\nIf the current character is '.', then:\n\n- If s_flag is .TRUE., output '1' and set s_flag to .FALSE.\n- Else, output '0'.\n\nIf the character is '-', then:\n\n- If s_flag is .TRUE., output '2' and set s_flag to .FALSE.\n- Else, set s_flag to .TRUE. (so wait for the next character)\n\nSo the main challenge is handling the output in Fortran, which typically buffers output lines. Since the Java code prints each digit as it's processed, we need to make sure that in Fortran, each write statement doesn't add a newline. So we can use the advance='no' parameter in the write statements.\n\nBut Fortran's formatted I/O can be a bit tricky. Let's structure the code step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input string. Let's assume that the input is a single line with no spaces, as per the Java code. So in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: input  ! assuming a max length, but better to adjust\nread(*,*) input\n\nThen, trim the input to get the actual length. Or loop until the end of the string. Wait, but in Fortran, when you read into a character variable, it's padded with spaces if the input is shorter than the declared length. So to process the actual characters, we need to loop up to the actual length of the input. Wait, but in Java, the next() method reads until the next whitespace, so the input is a single token. So in Fortran, reading with format (A) would get the entire line? Or perhaps use list-directed input. Hmm, perhaps read it as a single token, so using list-directed input (the * format) would read until a whitespace or newline.\n\nSo for example, if the input is \"--.-..\", then in Fortran, read(*,*) input would capture that as the input variable, left-justified, with trailing spaces.\n\nThen, loop from 1 to len_trim(input), which gives the actual length of the input without trailing spaces.\n\nWait, but len_trim returns the position of the last non-blank character. So for input = '--.-..', len_trim would be 6, and each character from 1 to 6 would be processed.\n\nSo the loop would be:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(input)\n    c = input(i:i)\n    ...\nend do\n\nNow, handling the output. Each time a digit is determined, we need to print it immediately without a newline. In Fortran, we can use the format statement with advance='no' like:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)', advance='no') '0'\n\nBut we have to make sure that each write statement uses this. Alternatively, collect the output into a string and print it at once. However, since the output is generated character by character, building a string might be easier, but in the Java code, each iteration may or may not output a character. For example, when a '-' is encountered and s is false, it doesn't output anything but sets s to true. Then, the next character will trigger an output.\n\nSo in the code, during each iteration, sometimes a character is printed, sometimes not. So building the output as a string could be possible, but the original Java code prints as it goes, which is straightforward. So using the advance='no' option in Fortran's write statements to mimic this.\n\nBut Fortran's output can sometimes buffer the output, and the advance='no' can be used to prevent line breaks. Let's try to code that.\n\nInitialize s_flag to .FALSE.\n\nThen, loop over each character:\n\nif (c == '.') then\n    if (s_flag) then\n        print '1', advance='no'\n        s_flag = .false.\n    else\n        print '0', advance='no'\n    end if\nelse if (c == '-') then\n    if (s_flag) then\n        print '2', advance='no'\n        s_flag = .false.\n    else\n        s_flag = .true.\n    end if\nend if\n\nWait, but the 'else' part is for the '-', right? So code structure in Fortran:\n\nlogical :: s_flag\ns_flag = .false.\ndo i = 1, len_trim(input)\n    c = input(i:i)\n    if (c == '.') then\n        if (s_flag) then\n            write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '1'\n            s_flag = .false.\n        else\n            write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '0'\n        end if\n    else  ! assume it's '-'\n        if (s_flag) then\n            write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '2'\n            s_flag = .false.\n        else\n            s_flag = .true.\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Java, the else clause corresponds to when the character is not '.', which in the Java code is checking for '-', but the code actually uses an else clause. So the original code's else is when the character is not '.', which in the problem's context would be '-', since the input is composed of '.' and '-'. So in Fortran, the code can safely check for '.' and else assume it's '-'.\n\nBut perhaps better to have an explicit check. However, the original code doesn't validate the input, so in Fortran, we can do the same.\n\nNow, after processing all characters, there's a possibility that s_flag is still .true. if the input ends with a '-'? Because in that case, the last character is a '-', which sets s_flag to .true., but there's no next character to process. But according to the problem statement, is the input always a valid Borze code? Because Borze code is defined such that every code is properly formed. So perhaps the input is always valid, and there are no trailing '-'s. But the Java code doesn't handle that case. So the Fortran code can also ignore it, as per the problem's constraints.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTesting with example inputs:\n\nFor example, input \".\", output is 0.\n\nInput \"-.\", should output 1.\n\nInput \"--\", outputs 2.\n\nInput \"-..-\", let's see:\n\nCharacters:\n\n1st '-': s_flag becomes .true.\n2nd '.': since s_flag is true, output 1, s_flag false.\n3rd '-': s_flag is false, so set to true.\n4th '-': since s_flag is true, output 2, s_flag false.\n\nSo output is 12.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, code in Fortran:\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nprogram codeforces_32_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200) :: input\n    logical :: s_flag\n    integer :: i\n    character :: c\n\n    read(*, *) input\n    s_flag = .false.\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(input)\n        c = input(i:i)\n        if (c == '.') then\n            if (s_flag) then\n                write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '1'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '0'\n            end if\n        else\n            if (s_flag) then\n                write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '2'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                s_flag = .true.\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    write(*, *)  ! to add a new line at the end\nend program codeforces_32_B\n\nWait, but the Java code does not add a new line at the end. However, in Fortran, each write statement may buffer the output. The final write(*, *) will add a new line. But in the original Java code, the outputs are printed without a new line. So in the Java code, after processing all characters, the output is a sequence of digits with no trailing newline. However, depending on the system, when the program ends, the output buffer may be flushed. But perhaps the problem expects the output to be exactly the digits with no newline. However, the Fortran code as written adds a newline at the end. That could be an issue.\n\nIn the Java code, after the loop, there's no System.out.println(), so the output is all the digits concatenated. But in the Fortran code, after the loop, we have a write(*, *), which adds a newline. That would be incorrect.\n\nSo to fix that, we need to remove that line. But then, how to ensure that the output is flushed. Because each write with advance='no' adds to the buffer, but without a final newline, the output may not be visible. However, in Fortran, when the program ends, the output buffer is typically flushed. So perhaps omitting the final write(*,*) is better.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nRemove the final write(*, *). So the code becomes:\n\nprogram codeforces_32_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200) :: input\n    logical :: s_flag\n    integer :: i\n    character :: c\n\n    read(*, *) input\n    s_flag = .false.\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(input)\n        c = input(i:i)\n        if (c == '.') then\n            if (s_flag) then\n                write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '1'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '0'\n            end if\n        else\n            if (s_flag) then\n                write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '2'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                s_flag = .true.\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\nend program codeforces_32_B\n\nBut how does Fortran handle the output buffer when using advance='no'? For example, if the program ends without a final line with advance='yes', the buffer may not be flushed. So in some systems, the output may not appear unless it's followed by a newline.\n\nIn Java, each System.out.print() flushes the buffer (or not? Well, in Java, the PrintStream used by System.out may be line-buffered, but perhaps not). However, in Fortran, using non-advancing output may require explicit flushing. To ensure that all the output is printed, perhaps after the loop, we can call a flush statement.\n\nBut standard Fortran 95 does not have a flush statement. However, many compilers support it as an extension, like call flush(). Alternatively, we can write an empty format with advance='yes' to flush the buffer.\n\nAlternatively, after the loop, write a '' with advance='yes', but that would add nothing. For example:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)', advance='yes') ''\n\nBut that would just output a new line. Wait, no. If you write a zero-length string with advance='yes', it will output a new line. But if you write a zero-length string with advance='no', nothing. Hmm, perhaps to flush the buffer, write a single space with advance='no'? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem's test cases expect the output to match exactly, perhaps the Fortran code's approach of writing each character with advance='no' and letting the program's termination flush the buffer is sufficient. However, this may vary by compiler. To be safe, perhaps after the loop, we can print a new line. But then the output would have a trailing newline, which might be incorrect according to the problem's expected output.\n\nWait, the original Java code does not print a newline. So the Fortran code must not print a newline either. So the solution is to remove the final write(*, *). But then, the output buffer may not be flushed, leading to no output being displayed. To avoid this, perhaps the code should flush the buffer.\n\nBut again, standard Fortran does not have a portable way to flush. However, for the purposes of code submission, perhaps the online judge is lenient. For example, if the code is as follows:\n\nprogram codeforces_32_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200) :: input\n    logical :: s_flag\n    integer :: i\n    character :: c\n\n    read(*, *) input\n    s_flag = .false.\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(input)\n        c = input(i:i)\n        if (c == '.') then\n            if (s_flag) then\n                write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '1'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '0'\n            end if\n        else\n            if (s_flag) then\n                write(*, '(A)', advance='no') '2'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                s_flag = .true.\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\nend program codeforces_32_B\n\nBut I'm not sure if this would work. Alternatively, perhaps collect the output into a buffer and print it all at once. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: output\ninteger :: pos\n\noutput = ''\npos = 0\n\nThen, for each character to be output, increment pos and set output(pos:pos) to the digit. At the end, write(*, '(A)') output(1:pos)\n\nThis way, we avoid the advance='no' issue. Let's see.\n\nThis approach would be better. Because building a string and then outputting it once. Let's adjust the code.\n\nInitialize a character buffer of sufficient size, say 200 characters (since the input can be up to 200 characters, but each input character could result in one output character (like '.' being 0) or two input characters resulting in one output (like '-.' being 1, etc. But the maximum output length is the same as the input length. For example, input of all '.' would produce the same length. So the output buffer can be the same length as the input.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprogram codeforces_32_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200) :: input, output\n    logical :: s_flag\n    integer :: i, pos\n    character :: c\n\n    read(*, *) input\n    s_flag = .false.\n    output = ''\n    pos = 0\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(input)\n        c = input(i:i)\n        if (c == '.') then\n            if (s_flag) then\n                pos = pos + 1\n                output(pos:pos) = '1'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                pos = pos + 1\n                output(pos:pos) = '0'\n            end if\n        else\n            if (s_flag) then\n                pos = pos + 1\n                output(pos:pos) = '2'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                s_flag = .true.\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    write(*, '(A)') output(1:pos)\nend program codeforces_32_B\n\nThis way, we collect all the digits into the output string and then print it all at once with a newline. Wait, but the original Java code does not print a newline. However, in Fortran, when you write using '(A)', it appends a newline. So the code as written would add a newline at the end, which the Java code does not.\n\nSo this is a problem. To avoid the newline, we can use:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)', advance='no') output(1:pos)\n\nBut then, after writing, we need to output a newline? But the problem's required output doesn't have a trailing newline. So for example, if the output is '120', the Java code prints exactly that, without any newline. But in Fortran, using write(*, '(A)', advance='no') would write the string without a newline, but when the program ends, the output may still be in the buffer. However, if we use this approach, and write the entire output at once, perhaps it's better.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_32_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200) :: input, output\n    logical :: s_flag\n    integer :: i, pos\n    character :: c\n\n    read(*, *) input\n    s_flag = .false.\n    output = ' '\n    pos = 0\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(input)\n        c = input(i:i)\n        if (c == '.') then\n            if (s_flag) then\n                pos = pos + 1\n                output(pos:pos) = '1'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                pos = pos + 1\n                output(pos:pos) = '0'\n            end if\n        else\n            if (s_flag) then\n                pos = pos + 1\n                output(pos:pos) = '2'\n                s_flag = .false.\n            else\n                s_flag = .true.\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    write(*, '(A)', advance='no') output(1:pos)\nend program codeforces_32_B\n\nBut initializing output as ' ' may not be necessary. Instead, we can initialize it as a string of spaces and then replace the relevant positions. But when we write output(1:pos), it includes all the characters up to pos. So this should work.\n\nThis approach avoids the need for multiple write statements and ensures that the output is written in one go without a newline. However, in Fortran, when you write a string with advance='no', it doesn't add a newline. So this should match the Java code's behavior.\n\nTesting this code with the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: . \nOutput: 0\n\nIn the code, c is '.', s_flag is false, so output '0' at position 1. Then write output(1:1) which is '0', no newline.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: -.\nProcessing:\n\ni=1, c is '-', s_flag is false \u2192 set s_flag to true.\ni=2, c is '.', s_flag is true \u2192 output '1' at pos 1. Then write '1' with no newline.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: -- \u2192 outputs '2' \n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The initial input is read with read(*, *), which reads until whitespace. So if the input has leading spaces, it would not capture them. But the problem's input is a Borze code, which consists of . and -, no spaces. So the Java code uses next(), which reads a token without spaces, so the Fortran code's read(*, *) is correct.\n\n- The output buffer is 200 characters, which is sufficient for inputs up to 200 characters. If the input is longer, the code would fail. But the original Java code uses a char array from in.next(), which has whatever length the input is. However, in Fortran, declaring a fixed-length string for input is necessary. So perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the input length is not more than 200. Alternatively, use a larger size.\n\nBut given that the original code uses a char array, which in Java can handle any length (up to memory), but for code submission platforms, it's common to assume a maximum input length. So the code should work as written.\n\nSo, the final Fortran code would be as written above, using an output buffer and writing it once without a newline."
