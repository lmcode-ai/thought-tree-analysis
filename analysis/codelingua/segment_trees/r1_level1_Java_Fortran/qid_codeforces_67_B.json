The loop for shifting is:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--). Since m is 0 initially, m++ makes m=1, and j_ starts at 0, but the loop condition is j_ >j (which is 0 >0 \u2192 false). So the loop doesn't run. Then aa[j] (j=0) is set to a.\n\nIn Fortran, when m=0, and we are inserting the first element. The j calculated would be 1 (assuming the inner loop exits with j=1). Then, to shift elements from j=1 to m=0 \u2192 no loop. So we directly set aa(1) = a_java, and m becomes 1. So in the code:\n\nAfter the inner loop (that finds j), the shifting is done from m downto j+1, but when m is 0, the loop doesn't run. So in Fortran, the code for shifting would be:\n\ndo j_ = m, j, -1\n\n    aa(j_ +1) = aa(j_)\n\nend do But when m=0 and j=1, the loop would run from 0 downto 1, which is not possible, so the loop doesn't execute. Then, aa(j) = a_java. Wait, but when m=0, the aa array is empty. So inserting at position j=1 would set aa(1) = a_java, and m becomes 1. Which is correct. So the code for shifting would be:\n\ndo j_ = m, j, -1\n\n   aa(j_ +1) = aa(j_)\n\nend do So this loop shifts elements from position j_ to j_+1. But when m is less than j, the loop doesn't run. So in Fortran, after finding j, the code shifts elements from m downto j, moving each to j_+1. Then insert a_java at j.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndo j_ = m, j, -1\n\n    aa(j_ +1) = aa(j_)\n\nend do\n\naa(j) = a_java\n\nm = m +1 Yes.",

So perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that for each a, bb[a] is such that the required number of elements >= a +k exists in the array. But in the absence of such guarantees, the code may fail. But since the original code works, we can assume that the input is valid. So in Fortran, we can proceed without checking j's bounds, but then during runtime, if j exceeds n, it will cause an out-of-bounds error.",

But then, if the loop exits with bb(a_f) >0, then the insertion position j will be n+1, which is invalid. But again, assuming the problem's input is valid, this won't happen. So the code as written may crash if j exceeds n. But in practice, if the input is valid, it should work. Another issue: in Fortran, the do loop for shifting:\n\ndo j_ = m, j, -1\n\n    aa(j_ +1) = aa(j_)\n\nend do But when m is 0 and j is 1, the loop runs from 0 to 1 in steps of -1. Which is not valid. So the loop doesn't execute, which is correct. For example, when m=0, j=1:\n\nj_ starts at 0 and goes down to 1.",

So this suggests that the code may have an error. But in the original Java code, this would also crash with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when j=3 (since aa's size is 3, indexes 0-2). So j=3 would access aa[3], which is out of bounds. So the problem's input must be such that this doesn't happen. So in the code's current state, it's possible to have out-of-bounds access if the input is invalid. But since the user's code is supposed to be correct for the given problem, we can assume that the input is valid.",

But when j exceeds n, accessing aa(j) would be out of bounds and cause a runtime error. So this is a problem. So we need to adjust the loop to prevent j from exceeding n. So in the inner loop, when j exceeds n, we should exit the loop. But how to replicate the Java code's behavior.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe code reads two integers, n and k. Then it reads an array bb of size n. It processes this array to create another array aa. The main logic is in the loops where for each a from n-1 down to 0, they adjust the position of 'a' in the aa array based on the values in bb. \n\nFirst, I'll need to set up the Fortran program structure. Fortran uses subroutines and programs, so I'll need to think about how to structure the input and output. The original Java code uses a Scanner for input and a PrintWriter for output. In Fortran, I'll use READ and WRITE statements.\n\nLooking at the main method in Java, the code reads n and k, then the array bb. The processing involves nested loops. The variable m seems to track the current size of the aa array as it's being built. For each a, the inner loop checks where to insert 'a' into the aa array based on the count in bb. Then, elements in aa are shifted to make space for the new element.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based indices. So I need to adjust for that. Let's see. The original code starts aa as an empty array, and for each a (from n-1 down to 0), inserts it into the aa array at position j. The loop for j increments until bb[a] is satisfied. The shifting part moves elements from m down to j to make space. Then aa[j] is set to a. Then m increments each time since we added a new element.\n\nHmm. Let me try to map this. The Java code's aa is being built from the end towards the start. The key part is figuring out where to insert each a into aa based on the value of bb[a].\n\nLet me think about the variables. In Java, aa is initialized to size n. The m variable starts at 0 and increments each time a new element is added. So for each a, after processing, m increases by 1.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are static, but we can manage them with indices. Let's see. For each a in reverse order (from n down to 1, since Fortran is 1-based?), the code checks how many elements in aa (so far) are >= a + k. Wait, the original code uses a from n-1 downto 0. But in Fortran, if we have a from n downto 1, that's equivalent. Because in Java, a starts at n-1, which is 0-based. So in Fortran, for a loop from 1 to n, but in reverse order. Wait, no. Wait, in Java, n is the size, so a starts at n-1 (0-based), down to 0. So in Fortran, since it's 1-based, the loop would be from a = n down to 1? Wait, no. Let's see. For example, if n is 3, Java's loop would be a = 2,1,0. Fortran would need to loop from 3 down to 1? But that's 3 elements. Wait, maybe in Fortran, the code should loop a from n-1 down to 0, but adjust for 1-based. Or perhaps in the Fortran code, we can keep the variables as 0-based, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps adjust the indices to 1-based. Hmm.\n\nThis part might get a bit tricky. Let's think through the original code:\n\nIn the Java code, for a in (n-1 downto 0). So a ranges from 0 to n-1. For each a, the code checks how many elements in the current aa array (which is built incrementally) are greater than or equal to a + k. The count of such elements is stored in bb[a]. Then, they insert a into aa at position j, which is determined by finding where the number of elements >= a + k equals bb[a]. \n\nWait, the code says:\n\nwhile (bb[a] > 0) {\n    if (aa[j] >= a +k) bb[a]--;\n    j++;\n}\n\nSo for each a, j starts at 0. For each j in aa (from 0 upwards), if aa[j] >= a +k, then decrement bb[a]. Once bb[a] becomes zero, the loop stops. Then, j is the position where a should be inserted. Then, the elements from j to m-1 are shifted right by one position (since m is the current size of aa). Then, aa[j] is set to a, and m increases by 1.\n\nHmm. So the insertion is such that after inserting a at position j, there are exactly bb[a] elements before j that are >= a +k. Because each time aa[j] is >= a +k, we decrement bb[a], and stop when it's zero. So the insertion position j is where a is placed so that the number of elements before it (in the current aa array) that are >= a +k is exactly the value of bb[a].\n\nSo the algorithm constructs the aa array by inserting elements starting from the largest a (n-1 downto 0) into the correct position such that the number of elements already present that are >= a +k is equal to bb[a].\n\nNow, to translate this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Java, n and k are read first. Then bb is read as an array of size n. Then aa is initialized as an array of size n, and m starts at 0. For each a from n-1 downto 0, process as follows.\n\nIn Fortran, the arrays would be 1-based. So perhaps a loops from n downto 1? Because in Java a is 0-based, so a=0 is the first element. Wait, no. Wait, the loop in Java is a starting at n-1 downto 0. So for n elements. In Fortran, perhaps a should loop from n downto 1. For example, if n is 5, Java's a is 4,3,2,1,0. Fortran's loop would be a =5 downto 1. But then the original code's a is the index into bb. Wait, bb in Java is of size n, indexes 0 to n-1. In Fortran, bb would be indexes 1 to n. So for a in Fortran, the original a in Java is a_f - 1. So when we process a in Fortran as going from n downto 1, the Java a is a_f -1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. For example, in the original code, the loop is for a in (n-1 downto 0). So in Fortran, a_java = a_f -1. So when Fortran's a_f is 1, a_java is 0. So in Fortran, the loop would be from a_f = n downto 1.\n\nSo, in Fortran, for a_f in 1 to n, the equivalent of the Java a_java is a_f -1. But since the loop in Java is from n-1 downto 0, in Fortran, it's from a_f = n downto 1, so that a_java = a_f-1, which ranges from n-1 downto 0.\n\nSo, for each a_f in Fortran (from n downto 1), we process the element a_java = a_f -1. Then, bb in Fortran is (1:n), corresponding to Java's 0:n-1. So bb_f(a_f) = bb_java(a_java).\n\nSo the first thing is to read n and k. Then read the bb array. Then, process each a_f from n downto 1, and for each, compute the position j where to insert a_java (which is a_f-1) into the aa array.\n\nBut the aa array in Fortran is 1-based. So the insertion logic needs to be adjusted.\n\nIn Java, the aa array is built starting from 0. m starts at 0. Each insertion shifts elements from j to m-1 right, then sets aa[j] = a_java (which is a_f-1 in Fortran terms). Then m increases by 1.\n\nIn Fortran, the aa array can be 1-based. m starts at 0 (but since Fortran is 1-based, perhaps m starts at 1?), but I need to track the current size. Let's see: in Java, initially m is 0. For each a processed, after insertion, m increments by 1. So in Fortran, m can start at 0, but when inserting, the current size is m elements. So inserting into j (1-based?), then shifting elements j to m to the right, then inserting at j, then m becomes m+1.\n\nWait, perhaps in the Fortran code, the aa array is 1-based. So for each a in Fortran's loop (from n downto 1), the a_java is a_f -1.\n\nBut let's think about the shifting part. In Java, when inserting into position j (0-based), they shift elements from j to m-1 (since m is the current length) to the right. Then set aa[j] = a_java, then m becomes m+1.\n\nIn Fortran, if j is 1-based, then to insert into position j, elements from j to m (current length) are shifted right. So for example, current elements are 1 to m. Insert at j: move elements j to m to j+1 to m+1, then set aa(j) = a_java. Then m becomes m+1.\n\nSo the code for shifting would be something like:\n\ndo j_ = m, j, -1\n    aa(j_ + 1) = aa(j_)\nend do\n\nBut m starts at 0, which would be a problem. Wait, in Fortran, the aa array is declared as (n), but we need to track the current size m. So m starts at 0. Then, for each insertion, after shifting, m increments by 1.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays start at 1, so when m is 0, the array is empty. When inserting the first element, j would be 1 (if the loop in Java's code found j=0, which in 1-based is j=1?), but perhaps not. Let me see.\n\nIn the Java code, for the first a (a_java = n-1), the inner loop:\n\nj starts at 0. The while loop checks if aa[j] >= a_java + k. Since the aa array is empty (m is 0), the loop doesn't run. Then, j is 0. Then, the code shifts elements from m (0) downto j (0) to the right. But m is 0, so the loop for j_ from m-1 (which is -1) downto j (0) would not execute. Then, aa[j] = a_java, and m becomes 1.\n\nSo for the first insertion, j is 0 (Java's 0-based), which in Fortran would be j=1. Wait, maybe not. Because in Java, inserting into position j=0 (the first element) would correspond to position 1 in Fortran. Wait, perhaps the j in Java is 0-based, and in Fortran, the j is 1-based. So for example, when Java's code sets j to 0, the Fortran code's j would be 1. But how does that affect the calculation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire algorithm can be adjusted to use 1-based indices in Fortran. Let's see:\n\nIn the Fortran code, for each a_f (from n downto 1), a_java is a_f -1. The code then computes j in 1-based, where to insert a_java into the aa array.\n\nThe inner loop in Java:\n\nint j = 0;\nwhile (bb[a] >0) {\n    if (aa[j] >= a +k) bb[a]--;\n    j++;\n}\n\nSo the loop checks each element in the current aa array (from 0 to m-1) until the condition is met. But in Fortran, the current aa array is from 1 to m (since m is the current size). So in Fortran, j starts at 1. For each j from 1 to m, check if aa(j) >= (a_java +k). If so, decrement bb. Continue until bb becomes zero.\n\nWait, but in Java's code, j increments until the loop stops. So for each j in aa (from 0 upwards), the code checks if aa[j] is >= a_java +k, and if so, decrements bb[a]. This continues until bb[a] is zero. Then, the insertion position is j. Then, shift elements from j to m-1 to j+1 to m, then insert a at j.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the current aa array (size m), we need to find j such that, when inserting a_java at position j, there are exactly bb[a_java] elements before j that are >= a_java +k.\n\nWait, the code seems to be similar to constructing a permutation based on some constraints. Maybe it's similar to the problem where you reconstruct the permutation based on the number of elements before it that are greater than a certain value.\n\nBut back to the translation. Let's try to model the loop in Fortran.\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor each a from n-1 downto 0:\n\n    j = 0\n\n    while (bb[a] >0):\n\n        if (aa[j] >= a +k):\n\n            bb[a]--\n\n        j++\n\n    then shift elements in aa from j to m-1 to j+1 to m, insert a at j.\n\n    m++\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nfor a_f from n downto 1:\n\n    a_java = a_f -1\n\n    j =1\n\n    do while (bb(a_f) >0)\n\n        if (aa(j) >= (a_java +k)) then\n\n            bb(a_f) = bb(a_f) -1\n\n        endif\n\n        j = j +1\n\n        ! but need to check if j exceeds current m\n\n    end do\n\nWait, but the current aa array has m elements. So the loop in Java runs j from 0 to m (current size), but in Fortran, j starts at 1 and goes to m. Wait, perhaps in Fortran, the loop should run j from 1 to m, and increment j until bb is decremented to zero.\n\nBut this isn't exactly the same as the Java code. In Java, the loop can run j beyond the current m. Because m is the current size of the aa array. Wait, no. Because when inserting elements, the aa array is built incrementally. For each a processed, the aa array has m elements. So for a new a, the initial m is the current size. The code in Java's inner loop starts j at 0 and increments until bb[a] becomes zero. But during this loop, j can go beyond the current m. Wait, no, because when the code processes a new a, the aa array has m elements (from 0 to m-1). So the loop j starts at 0, and can go up to m (since aa[j] is 0 to m-1, j increments until j equals m, which would be beyond the array. But in Java, this would throw an exception. But in the original code, since m is initially zero, but as elements are added, m increases. Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect. Or perhaps the loop runs beyond the array's current size. Wait, that can't be. Let's look at the original code.\n\nWait, when the code starts, m is 0, and aa is an array of size n. But when m is 0, the first insertion is at j=0. Then m becomes 1. Then for the next a, m is 1. But during the inner loop, j starts at 0 and increments. The code checks aa[j] (which is 0-based). So when m is 1, the aa array has elements 0 to 0. So during the loop, j can go up to m (but aa[j] would be beyond the current elements). Wait, that's a problem. Because the code in the inner loop would check aa[j], which may be uninitialized. So the Java code may have a bug here. But perhaps in the problem's constraints, it's guaranteed that the bb array is such that this doesn't happen. Or perhaps the code relies on the fact that the elements beyond m are zero (but in Java, the array is initialized to zero? Wait, no. Java initializes int arrays to zero. But aa is initialized as new int[n], so all elements are zero. So in the first insertion, when a_java is n-1, the code runs the loop to j=0. But when m is 0, the aa array's elements are all zero. So the code would check aa[j] (j starts at 0), which is zero. Then, if a_java +k is <= zero? Hmm, but a_java is n-1, so a_java +k is (n-1) +k. Which is likely larger than zero, so the code would not decrement bb[a]. So j increments. But the loop continues until bb[a] is zero, but the code may run j beyond the current elements, but since aa[j] is zero, which may not be >= a_java +k. So perhaps the loop will eventually exit. \n\nBut this seems like a potential issue. However, the original code works as per the problem's context, so I need to replicate its logic in Fortran.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code for each a_f (from n downto 1) would have:\n\na_java = a_f -1\n\nj starts at 1 (since Fortran is 1-based). \n\nThen, while bb(a_f) > 0:\n\n   if (aa(j) >= a_java +k) then\n\n       bb(a_f) = bb(a_f) -1\n\n   endif\n\n   j = j +1\n\nBut here, j can go beyond the current m elements. Because in Fortran, the aa array is of size n, and m is the current number of elements. So for j from 1 to m, but during the loop, j can exceed m, leading to checking aa(j) which are uninitialized (but since in Fortran, the array elements are not automatically initialized, this could cause problems). Wait, but in Java, the aa array is initialized to zero. So in Fortran, perhaps we need to initialize the aa array to zero as well.\n\nYes, in Java, the aa array is initialized to all zeros. So in Fortran, when declaring aa, we should initialize it to zero. Because in the inner loop, when j exceeds the current m (i.e., j > m), aa(j) would be zero. So in Java, the code can run j beyond the current elements, and since the array is zero-initialized, aa[j] will be zero, which may or may not satisfy the condition.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to make sure that aa is initialized to zero. So when declaring aa, we can set it to zero.\n\nSo, for Fortran code:\n\nRead n, k\n\nRead bb(1:n) (since in Fortran, it's 1-based, corresponding to Java's 0-based)\n\nInitialize aa(1:n) to 0\n\nm = 0\n\ndo a_f = n downto 1, 1\n\n   a_java = a_f -1\n\n   j =1\n\n   do while (bb(a_f) >0)\n\n       if (aa(j) >= a_java +k) then\n\n           bb(a_f) = bb(a_f) -1\n\n       endif\n\n       j = j +1\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Now, shift elements from j to m to the right by one position\n\n   do j_ = m+1, j+1, -1\n\n       aa(j_) = aa(j_ -1)\n\n   end do\n\n   aa(j) = a_java\n\n   m = m +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the shifting part. In Java, after finding j, they shift elements from m-1 downto j to the right. Then insert at j. For example, if m is the current length (number of elements), then elements j to m-1 are shifted to j+1 to m. Then, aa[j] = a, and m becomes m+1.\n\nIn Fortran, if m is the current number of elements (1-based), then inserting at position j (1 <= j <= m+1). So to shift elements from j to m to j+1 to m+1. Then insert at j.\n\nSo the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo j_ = m, j, -1\n\n    aa(j_ +1) = aa(j_)\n\nend do\n\nThen, aa(j) = a_java.\n\nBut in Fortran, if m is 0 (initially), then for the first element, j is 1. So m=0, the loop runs from 0 downto 1, which is invalid. So we need to handle the case when m is 0.\n\nWait, initially m=0. For the first a_f in the loop (a_f =n downto 1). For example, when m=0, and j is determined. Let's see how the Java code handles this.\n\nIn Java, when m=0, j starts at 0. The loop for shifting is:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--). Since m is 0 initially, m++ makes m=1, and j_ starts at 0, but the loop condition is j_ >j (which is 0 >0 \u2192 false). So the loop doesn't run. Then aa[j] (j=0) is set to a.\n\nIn Fortran, when m=0, and we are inserting the first element. The j calculated would be 1 (assuming the inner loop exits with j=1). Then, to shift elements from j=1 to m=0 \u2192 no loop. So we directly set aa(1) = a_java, and m becomes 1.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nAfter the inner loop (that finds j), the shifting is done from m downto j+1, but when m is 0, the loop doesn't run. So in Fortran, the code for shifting would be:\n\ndo j_ = m, j, -1\n\n    aa(j_ +1) = aa(j_)\n\nend do\n\nBut when m=0 and j=1, the loop would run from 0 downto 1, which is not possible, so the loop doesn't execute. Then, aa(j) = a_java.\n\nWait, but when m=0, the aa array is empty. So inserting at position j=1 would set aa(1) = a_java, and m becomes 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code for shifting would be:\n\ndo j_ = m, j, -1\n\n   aa(j_ +1) = aa(j_)\n\nend do\n\nSo this loop shifts elements from position j_ to j_+1. But when m is less than j, the loop doesn't run.\n\nSo in Fortran, after finding j, the code shifts elements from m downto j, moving each to j_+1. Then insert a_java at j.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndo j_ = m, j, -1\n\n    aa(j_ +1) = aa(j_)\n\nend do\n\naa(j) = a_java\n\nm = m +1\n\nYes. That should handle the shifting correctly.\n\nNow, the next step is to read the input. The original code reads from standard input. In Fortran, we can read using read(*,*) statements.\n\nThe Java code reads the array bb as:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) bb[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nIn Fortran, this is:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    read(*,*) bb(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen, the code processes and outputs the aa array elements, each added by 1. Because in the Java code, when printing, they add 1: aa[i] +1. Because the aa array in Java contains elements from 0 to n-1 (the a_java values), and when printed, they add 1 to get 1-based indices.\n\nWait, the Java code's aa array stores the a_java values, which are 0-based. So when printing, they add 1 to each element. So in Fortran, since the a_java is stored as aa elements, which are 0-based, we need to add 1 when printing.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code will have stored a_java values (which are 0-based) in the aa array. So when outputting, each element aa(i) is a_java, and we need to print aa(i) +1.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n    write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') aa(i)+1, ' '\n\nend do\n\nBut Fortran's write statements may require a different approach. Alternatively, we can build a string or use a format that writes each number followed by space.\n\nAlternatively, write each element with a format that appends a space, and then print a new line.\n\nSo, the code in Fortran would loop through aa, and print each element +1 followed by space.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, k, a_f, a_java, j, j_, m, i\n\n    integer, allocatable :: bb(:), aa(:)\n\n    read(*,*) n, k\n\n    allocate(bb(n), aa(n))\n\n    bb = 0\n\n    aa = 0\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) bb(i)\n\n    end do\n\n    m = 0\n\n    do a_f = n, 1, -1\n\n        a_java = a_f -1\n\n        j = 1\n\n        do while (bb(a_f) > 0)\n\n            if (j > m) exit  ! because aa(j) is zero, and if a_java +k >0, this won't affect\n\n            if (aa(j) >= a_java +k) then\n\n                bb(a_f) = bb(a_f) -1\n\n            end if\n\n            j = j +1\n\n        end do\n\n        ! Now, shift elements from m downto j\n\n        do j_ = m, j, -1\n\n            aa(j_ +1) = aa(j_)\n\n        end do\n\n        aa(j) = a_java\n\n        m = m +1\n\n    end do\n\n    do i =1, n\n\n        write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') aa(i) +1, ' '\n\n    end do\n\n    write(*,*)\n\n    deallocate(bb, aa)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the inner loop, j can go beyond m. For example, when the current m is 3, and j increments to 4. But aa(j) when j is 4 and m is 3 is zero (since aa was initialized to zero). So the condition aa(j) >= a_java +k depends on whether a_java +k is <= zero. But a_java is a_f -1, which ranges from 0 to n-1. So a_java +k can be up to (n-1) +k. So if a_java +k is positive, then aa(j) (which is zero) is not >= a_java +k. So in that case, the loop will keep incrementing j until bb(a_f) becomes zero. But how?\n\nWait, the original code in Java allows j to increment beyond the current m. Because the while loop continues until bb[a] is zero, regardless of whether j is beyond the current m. So even if j exceeds m, the loop continues. For example, if the current aa array has m elements (0 to m-1), j can increment to m, then m+1, etc. But in Java, the aa array is of size n, so j can go up to n-1. But the code relies on the fact that the bb array's values are such that the loop will terminate before j exceeds the array bounds.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code has aa allocated to size n. So j can go up to n. But in the inner loop, the code is:\n\ndo while (bb(a_f) >0)\n\n   if (aa(j) >= a_java +k) then\n\n       decrement bb(a_f)\n\n   endif\n\n   j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nSo j can go up to n+1, but in that case, j would be out of bounds. Wait, because aa has size n. So when j exceeds n, aa(j) is out of bounds. So this is a problem.\n\nIn Java, the aa array has size n, so j can go up to n-1. But in the code, the loop can increment j beyond n-1. For example, if the initial aa array is [0,0,0], and a_java +k is 5, then the loop would increment j until j = n (e.g., 3), but aa[j] is beyond the array. But in Java, accessing aa[j] when j >=n would throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. So this indicates a bug in the original code. However, the problem must have constraints that ensure this doesn't happen. \n\nBut in Fortran, we have to handle this. So the inner loop must ensure that j does not exceed the size of the array. But how?\n\nHmm. Perhaps the original code in Java is incorrect, but it passes the test cases. So to replicate the same behavior, we need to allow j to increment beyond the current m. But in Fortran, the aa array is of size n, so j can be up to n. But when j exceeds n, accessing aa(j) would be out of bounds and cause a runtime error.\n\nSo this is a problem. So we need to adjust the loop to prevent j from exceeding n. So in the inner loop, when j exceeds n, we should exit the loop.\n\nBut how to replicate the Java code's behavior. Because in Java, when j exceeds the array size, an exception would be thrown. But in the problem's test cases, this may not happen. So perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the bb array is such that the loop terminates before j exceeds n.\n\nBut for the Fortran code to be correct, we need to avoid array bounds errors.\n\nSo perhaps add a condition in the inner loop to exit if j exceeds the array size. For example:\n\ndo while (bb(a_f) > 0 .and. j <= n)\n\n   if (aa(j) >= a_java +k) then\n\n       bb(a_f) = bb(a_f) -1\n\n   endif\n\n   j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nBut this may alter the logic of the code. For example, if j exceeds n and bb(a_f) is still >0, the loop would exit, which is different from the Java code. Which would cause incorrect results.\n\nHmm. So this is a problem. But the original Java code is allowed to access aa[j] beyond the current m, but within the array's bounds. For example, if the array size is n, j can go up to n-1.\n\nWait, in Java, aa is declared as new int[n], so indexes from 0 to n-1. So j can be up to n-1. Because when j increments beyond m, but m is <=n-1. So in Java, the code can access aa[j] up to j =n-1.\n\nSo in the Java code, j can be up to n-1. So in Fortran, j can be up to n.\n\nBut in Fortran, the aa array is declared as (n), so j can go up to n. So in the inner loop, j starts at 1, and increments up to n.\n\nSo in Fortran, the inner loop should run while bb(a_f) >0, and j <=n. \n\nBut this may not be sufficient. Because in Java, j can go up to n-1 (since the array size is n). So in Fortran, j can go up to n.\n\nSo modifying the inner loop:\n\ndo while (bb(a_f) >0 .and. j <=n)\n\n    if (aa(j) >= a_java +k) then\n\n        bb(a_f) = bb(a_f) -1\n\n    endif\n\n    j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nBut what if after reaching j =n, and bb(a_f) is still >0? Then the loop would exit, and the code would insert at j =n +1, which is out of bounds. So this is a problem.\n\nSo this suggests that the original code relies on the fact that the bb array is such that the loop will always terminate before j exceeds the array size.\n\nSo perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that for each a, bb[a] is such that the required number of elements >= a +k exists in the array. \n\nBut in the absence of such guarantees, the code may fail. But since the original code works, we can assume that the input is valid.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can proceed without checking j's bounds, but then during runtime, if j exceeds n, it will cause an out-of-bounds error.\n\nTo avoid this, perhaps we should limit j to n. So the loop becomes:\n\ndo while (bb(a_f) > 0)\n\n    if (j > n) exit\n\n    if (aa(j) >= a_java +k) then\n\n        bb(a_f) = bb(a_f) -1\n\n    endif\n\n    j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nBut this changes the logic. For example, if j exceeds n but bb(a_f) is still positive, the loop exits, and j is set to n+1, which would cause the insertion at j=n+1, which is invalid.\n\nBut in Java, the code would have crashed in such a case, so perhaps the problem's test cases ensure that this doesn't happen.\n\nSo to replicate the Java code's behavior, we need to allow j to increment up to n, but in Fortran, the loop can proceed until j exceeds n, leading to an out-of-bounds error.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to allow j to increment up to n, but then when j exceeds n, the code will crash. But this is not desirable.\n\nAlternatively, we can assume that the problem's input is valid, and j will not exceed n. So proceed.\n\nThus, the inner loop in Fortran is:\n\nj =1\n\ndo while (bb(a_f) >0)\n\n    if (aa(j) >= (a_java +k)) then\n\n        bb(a_f) = bb(a_f) -1\n\n    end if\n\n    j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nBut in this case, if j exceeds n, accessing aa(j) would cause a runtime error.\n\nSo to prevent this, the code must ensure that j does not exceed n. So perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that this doesn't happen.\n\nBut how?\n\nAssuming that the problem's test cases are valid, the code will work. So proceed with the code as is.\n\nNow, testing with sample input.\n\nFor example, let's say n=3, k=0, and bb = [0,0,0]. Then for each a from 2 downto 0 (Java):\n\nProcessing a=2:\n\nbb[2] is 0. So j=0. Then insert a=2 at j=0. m becomes 1.\n\nProcessing a=1:\n\nbb[1] is 0. Insert at j=0. Shift elements (none), insert at 0. aa is [1,2]. m=2.\n\nProcessing a=0:\n\nbb[0] is 0. Insert at j=0. aa becomes [0,1,2]. Output: 1 2 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\na_f runs from 3 downto 1.\n\na_java =3-1=2, 2-1=1, 1-1=0.\n\nFor each a_f=3,2,1:\n\nProcessing a_f=3:\n\nbb(3) =0. j=1. Then insert at j=1. m becomes 1. aa(1)=2.\n\nProcessing a_f=2:\n\nbb(2)=0. j=1. Insert at j=1. Shift elements from m=1 to j=1:\n\ndo j_=1,1,-1 \u2192 aa(2)=aa(1). Then aa(1)=1. m becomes 2.\n\naa is [1,2].\n\nProcessing a_f=1:\n\nbb(1)=0. j=1. Insert at j=1. Shift elements from m=2 to j=1:\n\nj_=2 \u2192 aa(3)=aa(2)=2. j_=1 \u2192 aa(2)=aa(1)=1. Then aa(1)=0. m becomes 3.\n\naa is [0,1,2]. Output is 1,2,3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, k=1, bb = [1,0,0].\n\nBut maybe I'm getting stuck. Let's proceed to write the code as per the above logic.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, k, a_f, a_java, j, j_, m, i\n\n    integer, allocatable :: bb(:), aa(:)\n\n    read(*,*) n, k\n\n    allocate(bb(n), aa(n))\n\n    bb = 0\n\n    aa = 0\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) bb(i)\n\n    end do\n\n    m = 0\n\n    do a_f = n, 1, -1\n\n        a_java = a_f - 1\n\n        j = 1\n\n        do while (bb(a_f) > 0)\n\n            if (aa(j) >= a_java + k) then\n\n                bb(a_f) = bb(a_f) - 1\n\n            end if\n\n            j = j + 1\n\n        end do\n\n        ! Shift elements from m down to j\n\n        do j_ = m, j, -1\n\n            aa(j_ + 1) = aa(j_)\n\n        end do\n\n        aa(j) = a_java\n\n        m = m + 1\n\n    end do\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') aa(i) + 1, ' '\n\n    end do\n\n    write(*,*)\n\n    deallocate(bb, aa)\n\nend program main\n\nBut wait, in the Fortran code, the do loop for a_f is written as:\n\ndo a_f = n, 1, -1\n\nThis will loop from n down to 1, step -1, which is correct.\n\nBut in the inner loop, when j increments, it may exceed the array's bounds. For example, if j reaches n+1, which is beyond the size of aa. So to prevent this, perhaps add a condition to exit the loop when j exceeds n.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps modifying the inner loop as:\n\ndo while (bb(a_f) > 0 .and. j <= n)\n\n    if (aa(j) >= a_java + k) then\n\n        bb(a_f) = bb(a_f) - 1\n\n    end if\n\n    j = j + 1\n\nend do\n\nThis way, j won't exceed n. But then, if the loop exits with bb(a_f) >0, then the insertion position j will be n+1, which is invalid.\n\nBut again, assuming the problem's input is valid, this won't happen.\n\nSo the code as written may crash if j exceeds n. But in practice, if the input is valid, it should work.\n\nAnother issue: in Fortran, the do loop for shifting:\n\ndo j_ = m, j, -1\n\n    aa(j_ +1) = aa(j_)\n\nend do\n\nBut when m is 0 and j is 1, the loop runs from 0 to 1 in steps of -1. Which is not valid. So the loop doesn't execute, which is correct.\n\nFor example, when m=0, j=1:\n\nj_ starts at 0 and goes down to 1. Since 0 <1 and the step is -1, the loop doesn't run.\n\nSo aa(j) is set to a_java, and m becomes 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nBut there's one more thing: in the Java code, the aa array is of size n, but m is the number of elements inserted. So in Fortran, m starts at 0, and increments by 1 each time. When inserting the first element, m becomes 1, then 2, up to n.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 0\n\n0 0 0\n\nExpected Output: 1 2 3\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nAfter processing a_f=3 (a_java=2):\n\nbb(3) =0 \u2192 j=1.\n\nShift m=0 downto j=1 \u2192 no shift.\n\naa(1) =2. m=1.\n\nNext a_f=2 (a_java=1):\n\nbb(2)=0 \u2192 j=1.\n\nShift m=1 downto j=1 \u2192 j_=1, aa(2) = aa(1) =2. Then aa(1)=1. m=2.\n\nNext a_f=1 (a_java=0):\n\nbb(1)=0 \u2192 j=1.\n\nShift m=2 downto j=1 \u2192 j_=2, aa(3)=2; j_=1, aa(2)=1. Then aa(1)=0. m=3.\n\nOutput is 1 2 3.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, k=1, bb = [1, 0, 0]\n\nProcessing:\n\na_f=3 (a_java=2):\n\nbb(3) =1.\n\nj starts at 1. aa(1) is 0 (initialized to zero). Check if 0 >= 2 +1 \u2192 0 >=3 \u2192 no. So bb remains 1. j increments to 2. aa(2)=0 >=3? No. j increments to3. aa(3)=0 >=3? No. j increments to4. But aa(4) is out of bounds. So this would crash. So this suggests that the code may have an error.\n\nBut in the original Java code, this would also crash with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when j=3 (since aa's size is 3, indexes 0-2). So j=3 would access aa[3], which is out of bounds.\n\nSo the problem's input must be such that this doesn't happen.\n\nSo in the code's current state, it's possible to have out-of-bounds access if the input is invalid.\n\nBut since the user's code is supposed to be correct for the given problem, we can assume that the input is valid.\n\nThus, the Fortran code as written should correctly translate the Java code."
