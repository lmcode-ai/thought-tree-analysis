    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. So the main steps are:\n\n1. Read an integer n from input.\n2. Read 2n doubles into an array.\n3. Calculate some sums and counts of non-integer values.\n4. Compute max_sum and min_sum based on non_int and n.\n5. Determine the answer based on how sum_before compares to these sums.\n6. Output the answer formatted to three decimal places.\n\nHmm. Let me start by structuring the Fortran program. Fortran uses subroutines and functions, and for reading input, I'll probably use read statements.\n\nFirst, in Java, they read n via BufferedReader. In Fortran, I can read using the read statement. Then read the next line with 2n doubles. Oh right, Fortran requires static array sizes, but maybe I can read into an allocatable array. Wait, the Java code uses a Double array of size 2n. So in Fortran, I'll need to read 2*n numbers.\n\nWait, the code starts by reading n as integer, then the next line has 2n doubles. So in Fortran, after reading n, read a line (or list) of 2n doubles.\n\nNext, the variables non_int counts the number of elements that are not integers. So for each number in the array, check if the number is not equal to its floor. So in Fortran, using the intrinsic floor function. But since Fortran is case-insensitive, functions are in lowercase.\n\nSum_before is the sum of all the original numbers. Sum is the sum of their floors. Then, max_sum is the minimum of n and non_int plus sum. Min_sum is the maximum of (non_int - n) and 0, plus sum.\n\nThe ans is determined based on whether sum_before is between min_sum and max_sum. If not, ans is the difference. Otherwise, it's the minimum between 1 - fractional part and fractional part of sum_before.\n\nSo translating these steps.\n\nLet me start step by step.\n\nFirst, read n. In Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n\nread(*,*) n\n\nThen read the next line as 2n doubles. Let's create an array:\n\nreal(8), dimension(2*n) :: arr\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the array size has to be known at compile time unless it's allocatable. So maybe use allocatable:\n\ninteger :: n\nreal(8), allocatable :: arr(:)\n...\nread(*,*) n\nallocate(arr(2*n))\nread(*,*) arr\n\nBut wait, when reading the line with the 2n numbers, how does the read statement work? In Java, the StringTokenizer splits by whitespace. In Fortran, using list-directed input (read(*,*) arr) will read all the numbers from the input line, which may be split across lines if necessary, but assuming that the input is properly formatted.\n\nThen, compute non_int, sum_before, sum. Initialize them as 0.\n\ninteger :: non_int = 0\nreal(8) :: sum_before = 0.0d0, sum = 0.0d0\ninteger :: i\ndo i = 1, 2*n\n    real(8) :: num, floor_num\n    num = arr(i)\n    sum_before = sum_before + num\n    floor_num = floor(num)\n    if (num /= floor_num) then\n        non_int = non_int + 1\n    end if\n    sum = sum + floor_num\nend do\n\nThen, compute max_sum and min_sum:\n\nreal(8) :: max_sum, min_sum\nmax_sum = min(n, non_int) + sum\nmin_sum = max(0, non_int - n) + sum\n\nBut wait, in Java, Math.min(n, non_int) would take the smaller of the two. In Fortran, the min function can take two arguments. Similarly for max.\n\nThen compute ans:\n\nreal(8) :: ans, x\nif (min_sum > sum_before) then\n    ans = min_sum - sum_before\nelse if (max_sum < sum_before) then\n    ans = sum_before - max_sum\nelse\n    x = sum_before - floor(sum_before)\n    ans = min(1.0d0 - x, x)\nend if\n\nThen, output the ans with three decimal places. In Java, it's using printf with \"%.3f\". In Fortran, the format would be something like '(f0.3)'.\n\nBut wait, Fortran's format for three decimal places would be something like '(f0.3)'. Let's see:\n\nprint '(f0.3)', ans\n\nBut need to test if that works. Alternatively, format as '(f7.3)' or similar. However, the Java code outputs three decimal places, possibly with leading zeros if necessary. But the problem's example probably expects three digits after the decimal, so in Fortran, using '(f0.3)' may not work, because the width is set to 0. Maybe using '(f9.3)' to allow enough space.\n\nAlternatively, using write with a formatted string. For example:\n\nwrite(*, '(f0.3)') ans\n\nBut let's check. Suppose ans is 0.12345. Then f0.3 would output 0.123. However, Fortran's format descriptors require that the width is sufficient to hold the number, including the decimal point and the digits. So using something like '(f9.3)' would give a field width of 9, with three decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, using an explicit format like '(f0.3)', but perhaps Fortran allows that. Maybe better to use '(f0.3)' to avoid leading spaces.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nNow, in Fortran, variables need to be declared. So:\n\nprogram codeforces_351_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, non_int, i\n    real(8) :: sum_before, sum, max_sum, min_sum, ans, x, floor_num\n    real(8), allocatable :: arr(:)\n    \n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(arr(2 * n))\n    read(*,*) arr\n    \n    non_int = 0\n    sum_before = 0.0d0\n    sum = 0.0d0\n    \n    do i = 1, 2 * n\n        sum_before = sum_before + arr(i)\n        floor_num = floor(arr(i))\n        if (arr(i) /= floor_num) then\n            non_int = non_int + 1\n        end if\n        sum = sum + floor_num\n    end do\n    \n    max_sum = min(n, non_int) + sum\n    min_sum = max(0, non_int - n) + sum\n    \n    if (min_sum > sum_before) then\n        ans = min_sum - sum_before\n    else if (max_sum < sum_before) then\n        ans = sum_before - max_sum\n    else\n        x = sum_before - floor(sum_before)\n        ans = min(1.0d0 - x, x)\n    end if\n    \n    print '(f0.3)', ans\nend program codeforces_351_A\n\nWait, but in Java, the initial code uses Double.parseDouble, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, real(8) is the same as double precision.\n\nBut wait, when comparing arr(i) to floor_num, real numbers can have precision issues. For example, if the number is very close to an integer due to floating point inaccuracies. But the Java code checks num != Math.floor(num), which in Java is a direct comparison. So perhaps in Fortran, the same approach is okay, but there might be precision issues. However, assuming the input numbers are such that the fractional part is exactly representable (like x.xxx... exactly), then it's okay.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, floor returns a real(8) when the argument is real(8)? Or does it return an integer? Wait, the floor function in Fortran returns a real number equal to the largest integer less than or equal to the argument. Wait, no: wait, the intrinsic FLOOR function for real(8) returns an integer as a real? Or does it return an integer type?\n\nWait, no. The Fortran intrinsic FLOOR(A) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to A, as an integer if A is integer, but if A is real, it returns an integer type. Wait, no. Wait, let me check: the FLOOR function can return integer if the kind is specified.\n\nWait, the syntax is FLOOR(A [, KIND]). So, for example, FLOOR(arr(i)) would return a default integer, but if arr(i) is a real(8), then FLOOR(arr(i)) is a real number? No, wait, no. Wait, FLOOR function returns an integer. For example:\n\nreal(8) :: x = 3.7\ninteger :: y\ny = floor(x)  ! y is 3\n\nBut in the code above, in the line:\n\nfloor_num = floor(arr(i))\n\nBut arr(i) is real(8). Then floor(arr(i)) would return a real(8) value? Or an integer?\n\nNo, the FLOOR function returns an integer as per the KIND argument. If KIND is not specified, it returns a default integer. But in this case, floor_num is declared as real(8). So assigning an integer (from FLOOR) to a real variable would convert it to a real.\n\nWait, no. For example, in Fortran:\n\nreal :: x = 3.7\ninteger :: y\ny = floor(x)  ! y is 3\nreal :: z\nz = floor(x)  ! z is 3.0\n\nSo when you assign the result of FLOOR to a real variable, the integer value is converted to real.\n\nIn the code above, arr(i) is real(8). So FLOOR(arr(i)) would be a default integer (assuming no KIND argument). So assigning to floor_num (real(8)) would convert it to real(8).\n\nBut then, when comparing arr(i) to floor_num (which is real(8)), there could be precision issues. For example, if the original number is exactly an integer, then arr(i) == floor_num. But if it's something like 3.0, then floor_num is 3.0d0, so the comparison would be true.\n\nBut in cases where the number is not an integer, e.g., 3.1, floor_num is 3.0d0. So the comparison arr(i) /= floor_num would be true.\n\nBut in Java, the code checks if num != Math.floor(num), which is a double comparison. So in Fortran, the same logic applies.\n\nHowever, due to floating-point precision, when the number is something like 3.0000000000000001 (due to precision errors), the floor could be 3.0, and the original number is not exactly equal to 3.0, so it's considered non-integer.\n\nBut in the problem's context, perhaps the inputs are such that this is not a problem. So proceeding with the code as written.\n\nAnother thing: in the Java code, sum is the sum of the floors of all the numbers. sum is a double. In Fortran, since floor_num is real(8), sum is a real(8), which is correct.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nFor example, when n=1, input is 0.000 0.000.\n\nsum_before is 0.0, sum is 0.0. non_int is 0. max_sum is min(1,0) + 0 = 0. min_sum is max(0, 0-1) +0=0. sum_before is 0.0. So else case: x is 0.0, ans is min(1.0, 0.0) \u2192 0.0. So output 0.000.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, input 0.5 0.5. sum_before=1.0. sum is 0. non_int=2. max_sum is min(1,2) +0=1. min_sum is max(0,2-1) +0=1. sum_before is 1.0, which is between min and max. So x=1.0 -1.0=0.0. ans is min(1.0-0, 0) \u2192 0. So output 0.000.\n\nWait, but in this case, sum_before is 1.0. Then x=1.0 - floor(1.0) \u2192 0.0. So ans is min(1.0 - 0.0, 0.0) \u2192 0.0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: sum_before is 3.5. Then x=0.5. ans is min(0.5, 0.5) \u2192 0.5. Output 0.500.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nAnother possible issue: when reading the array. In Fortran, when using list-directed input (read(*,*) arr), each element is read in order. So as long as the input line has exactly 2n numbers, separated by spaces, it's okay. If the input has more numbers than 2n, the rest are ignored. But the Java code uses StringTokenizer, which splits the line into tokens. So in the Fortran code, the read statement should read all the 2n numbers correctly.\n\nNow, compiling this code. Possible pitfalls:\n\n- All variables must be declared. The code uses implicit none, so all variables are declared.\n\n- The array is allocated correctly with 2*n elements.\n\n- The format for printing is correct.\n\nIn Fortran, the format '(f0.3)' may not be valid because the width is zero. Let me check. The format specification for Fw.d, where w is the total width and d is the number of decimal places. So for example, to print 0.500, we need at least 5 characters (0.500). So f5.3. But if using f0.3, some compilers might allow it, treating it as minimal width. Alternatively, using something like '(f9.3)' to ensure enough space. However, the problem's example may require exactly three decimal digits, so using '(f0.3)' may not work, but in practice, the output should be similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use '(f8.3)'. For example, 0.000 would take 5 characters (including the decimal point). But if ans can be up to, say, 1000.000, then the width needs to be sufficient. However, since the problem's answer is always between 0 and 0.5 (due to the way the answer is calculated), using something like '(f5.3)' would suffice. But wait, 0.500 is 5 characters. So perhaps using '(f5.3)'.\n\nBut the Java code uses System.out.printf(\"%.3f\", ans); which outputs the number with exactly three decimal digits, possibly with leading zeros. For example, 0.5 is printed as 0.500.\n\nIn Fortran, the format '(f0.3)' might not work. Let's test with some examples. If ans is 0.5, then in Fortran, writing with '(f0.3)' would output '0.500', which is correct. But I'm not sure if Fortran allows zero width in format. So perhaps using a larger width like '(f8.3)'.\n\nAlternatively, use a format that dynamically adjusts. For example, using '(f8.3)' would output the number with 5 characters (like 0.500) or more if necessary, but leading spaces. But the problem's examples might expect no leading spaces. For example, if the answer is 0.500, the output should be exactly 0.500, not 0.500 with leading spaces.\n\nHmm. So how to format it in Fortran to output exactly three decimal places without leading spaces. The Java code uses %.3f which outputs as many characters as needed, with three decimal places.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps using the 'f0.3' format is possible. Let's see: according to some references, in Fortran 2008, the width can be zero, which means the minimal necessary. So for example, writing '(f0.3)' would output the number with enough width to display all digits, including the decimal point and three decimal places. So for 0.5, it would be '0.500'.\n\nSo the code uses print '(f0.3)', ans. That should work.\n\nNow, putting all together. The Fortran code should look like:\n\nprogram codeforces_351_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, non_int, i\n    real(8) :: sum_before, sum, max_sum, min_sum, ans, x, floor_num\n    real(8), allocatable :: arr(:)\n    \n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(arr(2 * n))\n    read(*,*) arr\n    \n    non_int = 0\n    sum_before = 0.0d0\n    sum = 0.0d0\n    \n    do i = 1, 2 * n\n        sum_before = sum_before + arr(i)\n        floor_num = floor(arr(i))\n        if (arr(i) /= floor_num) then\n            non_int = non_int + 1\n        end if\n        sum = sum + floor_num\n    end do\n    \n    max_sum = min(n, non_int) + sum\n    min_sum = max(0, non_int - n) + sum\n    \n    if (min_sum > sum_before) then\n        ans = min_sum - sum_before\n    else if (max_sum < sum_before) then\n        ans = sum_before - max_sum\n    else\n        x = sum_before - floor(sum_before)\n        ans = min(1.0d0 - x, x)\n    end if\n    \n    print '(f0.3)', ans\nend program codeforces_351_A\n\nI think this should work. Now, check for any possible errors.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the 'max' and 'min' functions for two integers are max(a,b) and min(a,b). So that's correct.\n\nThe variables are correctly declared. The array is allocated properly.\n\nOne thing to note: the Java code uses Double.parseDouble, which can handle numbers in scientific notation, but the Fortran code should also handle them since read with real(8) variables can parse them.\n\nSo this should be a correct translation."
