    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's look at the Java code first. The main steps are:\n\n1. Read two integers n and m.\n2. Compute their GCD using BigInteger's gcd method.\n3. Read two strings s and t.\n4. Check if for all k in 0 to gcd-1, the characters at positions (k*n/gcd) in s and (k*m/gcd) in t are the same. If any are different, output -1. Otherwise, output the LCM of n and m, which is (n*m)/gcd.\n\nSo the key parts are handling the input, calculating GCD, checking the characters, and outputting the result.\n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have built-in big integers, but since n and m are read as integers, their GCD can be computed using the Euclidean algorithm. So I'll need to write a function to compute GCD.\n\nIn Java, they use streams to check if any of the positions have mismatched characters. In Fortran, I'll need to loop from 0 to gcd-1 and check each condition. If any mismatch is found, set a flag and exit early.\n\nFor the LCM calculation, it's (n*m)/gcd. But since n and m might be large, multiplying them could overflow. However, in Java they use BigInteger to handle that. In Fortran, if the integers are 32-bit, it might overflow. But the problem might assume that the result fits. Alternatively, use 64-bit integers. So perhaps declare n, m, gcd as INTEGER*8 to handle larger values.\n\nWait, the original code uses longValue() for the result. So the output is a long, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, using INTEGER*8 for variables would be appropriate.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and m from input.\n2. Compute GCD(n, m).\n3. Read s and t.\n4. For each k from 0 to gcd-1:\n   a. Compute pos1 = k*n / gcd\n   b. Compute pos2 = k*m / gcd\n   c. Check if s(pos1+1) != t(pos2+1) (since Fortran is 1-based)\n   d. If any mismatch, set result to -1 and exit loop.\n5. If all match, compute LCM(n, m) as (n*m)/gcd.\n6. Output the result.\n\nNow, the details:\n\nIn Fortran, strings are read with their length. So when reading s and t, I need to read exactly the correct length. In Java, the scanner.next() reads the next token, which by default splits on whitespace. So the inputs are given as s and t, each being a single token. So in Fortran, when reading them, we can assume they are given as such.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read a string with a certain length, you need to know the length in advance. Wait, but in the Java code, the lengths of s and t are n and m, respectively. Because according to the problem statement (since the original problem is AGC028 A), which I recall is \"Two Abbreviations\". The problem requires that s has length n and t has length m. So in the Java code, when reading s and t, they must be of length n and m. So in Fortran, when reading s and t, they need to be of length n and m. So perhaps after reading n and m, we can read s and t with appropriate lengths.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read a string with a certain format, you need to have the variable declared with the correct length. So for example, if n is 5, then s is declared as CHARACTER(5) :: s, and read as such. But n is a variable, so dynamic allocation is needed. Alternatively, use a large enough fixed length. But that's not feasible. So perhaps using allocatable characters.\n\nBut Fortran 2003 allows for deferred-length character variables. So for example:\n\ncharacter(:), allocatable :: s, t\n\nThen, read the strings into them. But how to read a string of a specific length. For example, after reading n, we need to read a string of exactly n characters. So perhaps:\n\nAfter reading n and m, read s as a string of length n, and t as length m.\n\nIn Fortran, to read a string of exact length, you can use a format specifier. For example:\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nBut that would read until a newline, which may have leading or trailing spaces. Wait, but in Java's scanner.next(), the input is read as a token, which skips leading whitespace and reads until the next whitespace. So the Java code assumes that s and t are single tokens (without whitespace). So in Fortran, perhaps the code should read the entire line, but split into tokens. Alternatively, read the next n characters for s and m characters for t. But that's not correct if the input is given as space-separated tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as:\n\nn m\n\ns\n\nt\n\nOr perhaps as n m s t. Because in Java, scanner.next() reads the next token. So in the Java code, after n and m are read with nextInt(), then s and t are read with next(), which reads the next tokens. So the input would be four tokens: n, m, s, t.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading these tokens would require reading each token. So perhaps, first read n and m, then read s and t as the next two tokens. But Fortran's read statements can split the input into tokens separated by whitespace. So perhaps:\n\nread(*, *) n, m\nread(*, *) s\nread(*, *) t\n\nBut in this case, the lengths of s and t would be the lengths of the tokens read. Which should be exactly n and m, respectively. So the code will check that len(s) == n and len(t) == m, but according to the problem statement, the input s has length n and t has length m.\n\nBut in Fortran, if we read a token into a variable, the variable must have a length sufficient to hold the token. Otherwise, it's truncated or padded. So to read s of length n, we need to declare s as a character variable of length n. But n is variable. So how to handle that?\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because in Fortran, the length of a character variable must be known at compile time unless it is an allocatable (deferred length). So perhaps:\n\nAfter reading n and m, allocate s and t with lengths n and m.\n\nWait, in Fortran 2003, you can have deferred-length character variables. So:\n\ncharacter(:), allocatable :: s, t\n\nThen, after reading n and m, you can do:\n\nread(*, *) s\n\nBut how to read exactly n characters. Because the read statement would read the next token, which may be shorter or longer than n. For example, if the user inputs a token longer than n, then s will be truncated. But according to the problem statement, s is supposed to have length exactly n. So perhaps in the problem, the input is correct, so we can proceed.\n\nBut this is not safe. Alternatively, perhaps read the entire line, and process the tokens. But this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, assume that the input is correct and read the next two tokens for s and t, and check that their lengths are n and m. But in practice, for code submission, the test cases would have the correct input.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after reading n and m, the code would read s and t as the next two tokens, and their lengths would be n and m. So in Fortran:\n\nread(*, *) n, m\nread(*, *) s\nread(*, *) t\n\nBut s must be declared with a length that can accommodate up to n characters. But n is a variable. So this is a problem. Because in Fortran, the length must be a compile-time constant unless using allocatable characters.\n\nSo perhaps use allocatable characters. For example:\n\ncharacter(:), allocatable :: s, t\n\nThen, when reading, the code would read the tokens into a buffer and then allocate s and t with the correct lengths. But how?\n\nAlternatively, read the input as a line, split into tokens, and process them. This requires some string manipulation.\n\nAlternatively, read the first two integers, then read s and t with the correct lengths. For example:\n\nread(*, *) n, m\nallocate(character(n) :: s)\nallocate(character(m) :: t)\nread(*, '(A)') s\nread(*, '(A)') t\n\nBut this would read the entire line into s and t. For example, if s is supposed to be \"abc\", then reading with A3 would read exactly 3 characters. So perhaps the correct way is to read s with format A followed by n, and t with A followed by m. For example:\n\nread(*, '(A)') s  ! but s is length n, so if the input line is longer, it's truncated. Or maybe not?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the format (A3) to read exactly 3 characters. But in Fortran, the format (A) reads the entire line, but when the variable is of length n, it will read exactly n characters. Wait, according to Fortran rules, when using the format 'A' with a variable of length n, it will read n characters. So if the variable s is declared as character(n), then:\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nwill read exactly n characters from the input, possibly including leading or trailing whitespace. But in Java's next(), s is read as a token, which is a sequence of non-whitespace characters. So the input for s and t are tokens with no whitespace. Therefore, in Fortran, if the code reads s as a character(n) variable, and the input token is of length n, then it should work.\n\nBut how to read s and t as the next two tokens. Because after reading n and m, the next tokens are s and t. But each of s and t is a token of length n and m. So perhaps the code should read s with a length of n, and t with length m.

But in Java's next(), leading whitespace is skipped. So if the input for s and t is given as separate lines, this code would read s as the entire first line (including any leading/trailing spaces), and t as the next line. But according to the problem statement, s and t are tokens, so they should be read correctly.\n\nAlternatively, if the inputs for s and t are provided on the same line as n and m, then the read(*, *) n, m would read n and m, and then the next tokens would be s and t. So for example, the input could be:\n\n3 5 abc defg\n\nThen reading s as a 3-character token would read 'abc', and t as a 5-character would read 'defg', but wait, that's 4 characters. So in the problem, the input would have s of length n and t of length m.\n\nSo perhaps the code can read the tokens correctly.\n\nBut in Fortran, using list-directed input (read(*, *)) for the strings may read the entire token. For example:\n\nread(*, *) s\n\nwould read the next token into s, but s's length may not match. For example, if s is declared as 5 characters and the token is 3 characters, it will be left-justified and padded with spaces. But the problem states that the input s has exactly n characters, so in the code, after reading n, allocating s as n characters and reading with list-directed input would read the token into s, possibly with trailing spaces if the token is shorter than n. But that's a problem.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because in Java, the code reads the next token as s, which has exactly n characters. So in Fortran, to read s correctly, we need to read exactly n characters. So perhaps the code should read the s and t with format A, specifying exactly the length. For example:\n\nAfter allocating s as n characters:\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nBut this would read the entire line into s, which is n characters. So if the input for s is given as a token (without leading/trailing spaces) followed by other tokens, this would read the first n characters of the line, which may include more than the token. That's a problem.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. For example, suppose n is 3, and the input for s is \"abcde\", then reading s as 3 characters would take 'abc', which is correct. But if the input is \"ab c\", then s would read 'ab ' (including the space). But in Java's next(), the s would be \"ab\" and then next token is \"c\", leading to wrong results.\n\nThis suggests that the way the input is read in Fortran may differ from Java's next(), leading to potential errors.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for s and t are correct, so perhaps the code can assume that after the first two integers, the next tokens are s and t, each with exactly n and m characters.\n\nIn that case, using list-directed input (read(*, *)) for s and t may work. Because list-directed input skips leading whitespace and reads until the next whitespace. But the problem is that in Fortran, when you read a string with list-directed input, it reads the next token and stores it left-justified in the variable, truncating or padding with spaces as needed. So if the variable is of length n, and the token is of length exactly n, then it's stored correctly. If the token is shorter, it's padded with spaces. If longer, truncated.\n\nSo in the code, s is allocated to length n. So if the input token for s is exactly n characters, then list-directed read would read it correctly. If it's shorter, then s will have trailing spaces, which when compared to the characters in the code would cause mismatch. So the code would output -1 even if the input is correct. Which is a problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to read s and t with exactly n and m characters, which requires that the input is formatted correctly. For example, the s must be a string of exactly n characters, possibly followed by whitespace.\n\nSo perhaps using a format string with An and Am for reading s and t.\n\nSo:\n\nread(*, '(A)') s  ! reads exactly n characters\nread(*, '(A)') t  ! reads exactly m characters\n\nBut then, the input must be arranged such that s is on a separate line of exactly n characters, and t on another line of m characters. But this may not be the case. For example, the input could be provided as one line with n and m, then the next line for s, then next line for t.\n\nSo the code can be written to read n and m, then read a line for s, then a line for t.\n\nIn this case, the code can be:\n\nread(*, *) n, m\nallocate(character(n) :: s)\nallocate(character(m) :: t)\nread(*, '(A)') s\nread(*, '(A)') t\n\nBut then, if the lines for s and t contain more than n or m characters, the read will take the first n or m characters, which is correct. If the lines are shorter, then the remaining characters are padded with spaces.\n\nSo this approach should work as long as s and t are given each on separate lines with exactly the required length.\n\nBut how to handle cases where s and t are given on the same line as other data? For example, after n and m, the next line contains s followed by t. But that would require that s takes the first n characters and t takes the next m characters. But this depends on the input format.\n\nIn the original problem statement (AGC028 A), the input is given as n and m on the first line, s on the second line, and t on the third line, each of length n and m. So reading each of s and t as separate lines is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should read n and m, then read s as a line of n characters, then t as a line of m characters.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with:\n\nread(*, *) n, m\nallocate(character(n) :: s)\nallocate(character(m) :: t)\nread(*, '(A)') s\nread(*, '(A)') t\n\nBut when reading with '(A)' format, the code reads the entire line into s, but s is only length n. So if the line has more than n characters, the rest is truncated. If it's exactly n, it's correct. If less, padded with spaces. So in this case, the code works.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the positions are k*n/gcd and k*m/gcd. Since n and m are divisible by gcd (because gcd is their greatest common divisor). So (k*n) is divisible by gcd, so the division is integer. Similarly for m. So in Fortran, integer division (/) truncates towards zero, which is correct here because all divisions are exact.\n\nIn Fortran, integer division with / between integers gives integer result with truncation. So k*n/gcd_val should be calculated as (k * n) / gcd_val, which is correct.\n\nAlso, the strings in Fortran are 1-based, so the positions are pos1 + 1 and pos2 + 1.\n\nTesting an example. For example, the sample input 1:\n\n3 4\nabc\nabca\n\nThen gcd(3,4) is 1. So check k=0:\n\npos1 = 0*3/1 = 0 \u2192 s[0+1] = 'a'\n\npos2 = 0*4/1=0 \u2192 t[0+1] = 'a' \u2192 match. So LCM is 3*4/1=12 \u2192 output 12.\n\nAnother example where there's a mismatch. Let's say n=2, m=4, s=ab, t=aaxa. GCD is 2. Then for k=0 and 1:\n\nk=0: pos1 =0*2/2=0 \u2192 s[1] = 'a'; pos2=0*4/2=0 \u2192 t[1] = 'a' \u2192 match.\n\nk=1: pos1=1*2/2=1 \u2192 s[2] = 'b'; pos2=1*4/2=2 \u2192 t[3] = 'x' \u2192 mismatch \u2192 output -1.\n\nIn code, the loop would check k from 0 to 1 (since gcd=2-1=1). For k=1, check s[2] vs t[3], which are different. So result is -1.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, for the LCM calculation, using (n*m)/gcd_val. But since n and m can be up to 1e5, their product could be up to 1e10, which fits in 32-bit integer (which is up to ~2e9). Wait, 1e5 * 1e5 is 1e10, which is larger than 2^31 (about 2.1e9). So 32-bit integers would overflow, but 64-bit integers (integer(8)) can handle up to 9e18. So in the code, variables n, m, gcd_val, etc., should be declared as integer(8) to avoid overflow.\n\nPutting it all together, the Fortran code would look like the one I outlined above.\n\nNow, check the code for possible errors.\n\nFirst, the GCD function. The Euclidean algorithm is correctly implemented in the function.\n\nThen, the loop from k=0 to gcd_val-1. Since in Fortran, loops are inclusive, so 0 to gcd_val-1 is correct.\n\nThe calculation of pos1 and pos2 is (k * n) / gcd_val. Since k is up to gcd_val-1, (k * n) is (gcd_val-1)*n. Since n and m are multiples of gcd_val (because the GCD is their common divisor), this division is exact.\n\nWait, not exactly. Wait, the GCD is the greatest common divisor of n and m. So for example, n=6, m=4, GCD is 2. Then n is divisible by 2, m is divisible by 2. So (k * n) / gcd_val is k * (n/gcd_val) which is an integer. Same for m.\n\nYes. Because n/gcd_val and m/gcd_val are integers. So the division is exact.\n\nThus, pos1 and pos2 are integers.\n\nIn the code, pos1 and pos2 are calculated as (k * n) / gcd_val and (k * m) / gcd_val. Then, the code accesses s(pos1+1) and t(pos2+1). Since pos1 ranges from 0 to (gcd_val-1)*n / gcd_val. Since n/gcd_val is integer, (gcd_val-1)*n/gcd_val is (n/gcd_val) * (gcd_val-1). For example, if n=6, gcd_val=3, then (k *6)/3= 2k. For k from 0 to 2 (gcd_val-1=2), pos1=0, 2, 4. Which are valid indices for s of length 6 (indices 1-6). So pos1+1 is 1,3,5. So correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the division of integers is truncating towards zero. So if (k*n) is negative, but since k is non-negative, n and gcd_val are positive, so no problem.\n\nThus, the code should work."
