So the elements before that are <2. So the count is left-1=2 (elements 1 and 2 are 1 and 2). But 2 is equal to target. So the code in Java would have l=2, which counts a[0], a[1], a[2] (0-based) if they are 1,2,3. So l=2 (indices 0 and 1) \u2192 count is 2.\n\n            ! But in this example, now=2, x=5. The product 2*2=4 <5. So the code in Java counts a[0], a[1], a[2] (if a[2] is 2). Wait, no. The binary search code in Java for now=2 and x=5:\n\n            initial l=0, r=3 (n=3).\n\n            mid=1 (0+3)/2=1. a[1]=2. 2*2=4 <5 \u2192 yes. l becomes 2. Now l=2, r=3. mid=2. a[2]=3. 3*2=6 >=5 \u2192 r=2. Loop ends. l=2 \u2192 count is 2 elements (0 and 1). So the code in Java counts 2 elements. But the actual elements where product is <5 are 1,2 (products 2,4). So the count is correct. So in Fortran, the code's binary search gives left-1=2 (elements 1 and 2), which is correct. So the code in Fortran is correct.

Because when now is negative, the array is sorted in ascending order. So for example, the array could be [-5, -3, -2, 1, 4]. If now is -2, and x is 6. Then now*a[c] >=x \u2192 -2*a[c] >=6 \u2192 a[c] <=-3. So looking for a[c] <=-3. The product would be >=6. But the code checks if now*a[c] >=x \u2192 if yes, then move l to c+1.

So the loop ends when l is the first index where now*a[c] <x. All elements before l are those where now*a[c] >=x. So the count of elements where now*a[c] <x is (n - l), because the elements from l to n-1 are the ones where product <x. So the code adds (n - l) to tot.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The main method reads integers n and k, then an array of longs a. It sorts the array and performs a binary search between -INF and INF to find the maximum value l such that check(l) is true. The check function calculates the number of pairs in the array whose product is less than x, and then checks if half of that total is less than k.\n\nHmm. Fortran has some differences here. Variables need to be declared properly, especially arrays. Also, Fortran uses 1-based indexing by default, but the original code uses 0-based. That might complicate things, especially in loops and array accesses. Let me note that.\n\nFirst, the main variables. The Java code uses static variables mod, DX, DY, n, k, a. In Fortran, I'll need to use modules or pass them as arguments. Since the functions need to access n, k, a, maybe putting them in a module would help. Let's create a module to hold these variables.\n\nNext, the binary search in main. The loop is while (l + 1 < r), which in Fortran can be a do while loop. The check function returns a boolean, which in Fortran is a logical.\n\nThe check function loops through each element in the array and performs another binary search. For each a[i], if it's non-negative, it counts how many elements a[c] satisfy a[i] * a[c] < x. If a[i] is negative, it counts how many elements a[c] >= x when multiplied (since the product would be less than x if a[c] is negative, but maybe I need to think carefully here).\n\nWait, the Java code for the check function: when now is negative, the binary search is finding the first index where now * a[c] < x. Because when now is negative, multiplying by a higher a[c] (but maybe more negative) could yield a product that's larger. So the binary search is adjusted. Let's make sure the Fortran code captures this correctly.\n\nIn Fortran, the binary search implementation will need to be adjusted. Let's see. For example, when now is non-negative (a[i] >=0), the binary search finds the first index where a[c] >= x / now (since now is positive, so the inequality direction is same). Wait, but in the code, the Java code uses now * a[c] < x. So for a sorted array, if now is positive, then a[c] must be <= x/now (if x is positive?), but the array is sorted, so the binary search is looking for the first position where a[c] is >= x / now. Wait, no. Wait, the array is sorted in Java, and when now is positive, the code does:\n\nif now * a[c] < x: l = c +1 else r = c.\n\nSo the loop is finding the leftmost index where a[c] >= x / now. Because once a[c] is large enough that the product is >=x, we set r = c. So after the loop, l is the number of elements that are < x / now. Because for the sorted array, all elements before l are less than x / now.\n\nBut wait, in the sorted array a is sorted. So for now being positive, the code is counting how many elements a[c] (from 0 to n-1) are such that a[c] < x / now. But since the array is sorted, this can be found via binary search.\n\nBut in Fortran, since the array is sorted, perhaps using a similar approach. But need to handle the indices correctly. Java uses 0-based, Fortran is 1-based by default. So when porting, the array indices will need to be adjusted. For example, in Java, the array is from 0 to n-1. In Fortran, it would be from 1 to n. So loops would go from 1 to n, and indices in binary search would be adjusted.\n\nWait, but the original code in Java for a is sorted. So when the array is sorted, in Fortran, the array is also sorted in the same order. So for each element a(i) in Fortran, which is a(1), a(2), ..., a(n). So when a(i) is positive, the binary search in check function would look for the number of a(j) where a(j) * a(i) < x.\n\nBut the code's check function loops through each element a[i], and for each, does a binary search on the array. Let's think about the code again.\n\nIn Java's check function:\n\nfor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   if a[i] >=0:\n\n      binary search in a[0..n-1] for the first position where a[i] * a[c] >=x. The number of elements less than x is l (since l is the count of elements where a[i]*a[c] < x). So tot += l.\n\n   else:\n\n      binary search in a[0..n-1] for the first position where a[i]*a[c] <x. Then, the count is n - l, because a[i] is negative, so higher elements (which are larger in value, but when multiplied by a negative, the product decreases). So the elements from l to n-1 (in Java) are those where a[i]*a[c] <x, so the count is n - l.\n\nBut in Fortran, since the array is 1-based, the code would need to adjust the indices. For example, the binary search for a[i] (now in Java) which is a(ix) in Fortran (ix ranges from 1 to n). So the binary search in Fortran would need to adjust the l and r accordingly.\n\nAnother thing to note: the original code sorts the array a. So in Fortran, after reading the array, we need to sort it. Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort, but can implement a quick sort or use an existing implementation. Alternatively, since the original code uses Arrays.sort(a) which for primitive arrays uses a dual-pivot quicksort. So perhaps in Fortran, we can implement a simple sorting routine. But for simplicity, maybe using a bubble sort, but that's inefficient for large n. However, the problem's constraints are not given here. Since the original code is for a programming contest, perhaps the Fortran code can use an efficient sorting method.\n\nBut in any case, the array must be sorted. So in Fortran, we'll have to sort the array. Let's assume that we can use a simple sort function. Alternatively, since the code is supposed to be correct, perhaps a call to a sort subroutine. Let me check: in Fortran, can we use the intrinsic sort function? No, Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function. So I need to implement a sorting algorithm. For the sake of time, perhaps a simple quick sort implementation.\n\nBut given that the Java code sorts the array, the Fortran code must also sort the array in the same way. Let's proceed.\n\nSo, in the main program, after reading the array, we need to sort it. So perhaps writing a subroutine for quicksort. Let's include that.\n\nNow, the check function. Let's see:\n\nThe key part is the binary search for each element. Let's take the case when now is positive. In Java, the code does:\n\nint l = 0, r = n;\n\nwhile (l < r) {\n\n    int c = (l + r) / 2;\n\n    if (now * a[c] < x) l = c +1;\n\n    else r = c;\n\n}\n\nso this finds the first index where a[c] >= x / now. Because when now is positive, the condition now * a[c] <x is equivalent to a[c] <x/now. So the loop finds the first index where a[c] >=x/now. The number of elements less than x/now is l. So adding l to tot.\n\nIn Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the indices would be from 1 to n. So when we perform the binary search, the left and right would start at 1 and n+1? Because in Java, the right is n (exclusive). So in Fortran, the initial left is 1, right is n+1. Then, mid is (left + right)/2. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in Java, the loop runs while l < r. So for the binary search in Java, the range is [l, r), which in Fortran can be adjusted to [left, right), but with 1-based indices.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the binary search for the first position where a(c) >= target. So the code in Fortran would:\n\nleft = 1\n\nright = n + 1\n\ndo while (left < right)\n\n    mid = (left + right) / 2\n\n    if (a(mid) < target) then\n\n        left = mid + 1\n\n    else\n\n        right = mid\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nso after the loop, left is the first index >= target. So the count is left - 1.\n\nBut in the Java code, when now is positive, target is x / now. Wait, but the Java code uses now * a[c] <x. So target is x / now, and if a[c] < target, then now * a[c] <x. So the binary search is looking for the first position where a[c] >= target. The number of elements < target is left (in Java code's case, since the array is 0-based and the left is the first index where the condition is not met).\n\nWait, the Java code's binary search for now >=0:\n\nIn Java, for now >=0, during binary search, if a[c] is such that now * a[c] <x \u2192 we move left to c+1. So the loop finds the first index where a[c] >=x/now. The total elements that are less than x/now is l (since l starts at 0 and increments). So for the Java code, after the loop, l is the number of elements where a[c] <x/now. Because in the array a[0..n-1], the elements from 0 to l-1 are <x/now.\n\nBut since in Fortran, the array is 1-based, the same approach would apply. For example, in Fortran:\n\ntarget = x / now (but need to handle division properly, considering integer division vs floating point. Wait, but the variables are of type long in Java, which are 64-bit integers. In Fortran, they can be integer(kind=8). So in the original code, all variables are integers. So when x is divided by now (if now is positive), it's integer division. But in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but it truncates towards zero. Java does the same. So in Fortran, target = x / now.\n\nBut since x and now are integers, for example, if x is 5 and now is 2, then x / now is 2 (since 5/2 is 2.5, truncated to 2). So the code for the binary search in Fortran would be:\n\nleft = 1\n\nright = n + 1\n\ndo while (left < right)\n\n    mid = (left + right) / 2\n\n    if (a(mid) < target) then\n\n        left = mid + 1\n\n    else\n\n        right = mid\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\ncount = left - 1\n\nso the count is left - 1 elements are less than target.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the code uses l (the left after the loop) as the count, because the array is 0-based, and the elements from 0 to l-1 are included. So the count is l elements. Because in Java, the initial right is n (exclusive). So after the loop, l is the number of elements that are less than the target.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the array is [1,2,3,4,5], n=5. Target is 3. The code in Java would have l=0, r=5 initially. Then:\n\nc = (0+5)/2 = 2. a[2]=3. 3 >=3 \u2192 r=2.\n\nNow l=0, r=2.\n\nc = 1. a[1]=2 <3 \u2192 l=2.\n\nNow l=2, r=2 \u2192 exit. So l=2. The number of elements less than 3 is 2 (elements 0 and 1). So the count is l=2.\n\nBut in Fortran, the same array would be [1,2,3,4,5], 1-based. Target is 3.\n\nleft starts at 1, right at 6.\n\nmid = (1+6)/2 = 3. a(3)=3 >=3 \u2192 right=3.\n\nloop: left=1 < right=3.\n\nmid = 2. a(2)=2 <3 \u2192 left=3.\n\nnow left=3, right=3 \u2192 exit. The count is left-1=2.\n\nSo in Fortran, left-1 is the count of elements less than target. But in Java, the count is l. So for the case when now is positive, the code in Java adds l to tot. So in Fortran, we need to add left-1 to tot.\n\nBut the original code for now >=0:\n\ntot += l.\n\nBut in Fortran, after the binary search, the count is left-1. So in Fortran, we add (left-1) to tot.\n\nBut wait, let's re-examine the Java code for the case when now >=0:\n\nAfter the binary search, l is the number of elements where a[c] < x/now. Because the code is finding the first index where a[c] >= x/now. All elements before that index are less than x/now.\n\nIn Java, the array is 0-based, so the indices 0 to l-1 are the elements less than x/now. So the count is l elements.\n\nIn Fortran, the array is 1-based. The binary search finds left as the first index where a[c] >= target. The elements before that are 1 to left-1. So the count is left-1 elements.\n\nSo for now >=0, in Fortran, the count is left-1. So tot = tot + (left -1).\n\nSimilarly, when now is negative, the code in Java does:\n\nbinary search for the first index where a[c] >= x/now (but since now is negative, the inequality is reversed). Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn Java, when now is negative, the code checks if now * a[c] >=x. So the condition is now*a[c] >=x \u2192 since now is negative, this is equivalent to a[c] <= x/now (since multiplying by a negative reverses the inequality). So the code is trying to find the first index where a[c] <= x/now. Because when now is negative, a[c] values that are larger (since the array is sorted in ascending order) would produce a smaller product. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose now is -2. x is 6.\n\nThen now * a[c] >=x \u2192 -2 *a[c] >=6 \u2192 a[c] <= -3.\n\nSo in the array sorted in ascending order, all a[c] <=-3 will satisfy the condition. So the code uses binary search to find the first index where a[c] > x/now (but since now is negative, the direction is reversed). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nThe code for now <0:\n\nIn Java, during the binary search, if now *a[c] >=x \u2192 l = c+1. Else, r =c. So the code is looking for the first index where now*a[c] <x. Because when now is negative, the array is sorted in ascending order. So for example, the array could be [-5, -3, -2, 1, 4].\n\nIf now is -2, and x is 6. Then now*a[c] >=x \u2192 -2*a[c] >=6 \u2192 a[c] <=-3. So looking for a[c] <=-3. The product would be >=6. But the code checks if now*a[c] >=x \u2192 if yes, then move l to c+1. So the code is finding the first index where a[c] < x/now. Wait, no. Because x/now when now is negative is x divided by a negative number, which would reverse the inequality.\n\nAlternatively, the code's condition is now * a[c] >=x. So when now is negative, dividing both sides by now (which is negative) flips the inequality: a[c] <= x/now. So for example, x=6, now=-2 \u2192 x/now = -3. So a[c] <=-3.\n\nSo the code is looking for elements a[c] that are <=-3. So in the array sorted in ascending order, all elements from the start up to some index satisfy this. The binary search finds the first index where a[c] > x/now (which is -3 in this example). Because the loop is looking for the first index where now*a[c] <x (since the condition is if now*a[c] >=x \u2192 l = c+1. So in the binary search, when the product is >=x, the code moves l to c+1. So the loop ends when l is the first index where now*a[c] <x. All elements before l are those where now*a[c] >=x. So the count of elements where now*a[c] <x is (n - l), because the elements from l to n-1 are the ones where product <x. So the code adds (n - l) to tot.\n\nBut in Fortran, since the array is 1-based, the code will have to adjust the indices. Let's see:\n\nIn Java, the code for now <0:\n\nthe binary search's l and r start at 0 and n. So the code finds the first index c where now*a[c] <x. Then, the number of elements >=x is l (since elements before l have product >=x). So the count is (n - l) elements with product <x.\n\nIn Fortran, for now <0:\n\nWe need to perform a binary search to find the first index where now * a[c] <x. Wait, no. Let's think again. The code in Java is:\n\nif (now * a[c] >=x) \u2192 move l to c+1. So the code is looking for the first index where a[c] is such that now*a[c] <x. The elements from l to n-1 (in Java) are those where now*a[c] <x. So the count is n - l.\n\nBut how to translate this into Fortran's 1-based indices.\n\nSo, the binary search in Java for now <0:\n\nleft starts at 0, right at n. The loop runs until left < right. The code sets mid = (left + right)/2. If now*a[mid] >=x, then left = mid +1. Else, right = mid. So after the loop, left is the first index where now*a[c] <x. The count is n - left.\n\nIn Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the binary search will start with left=1, right=n+1. The mid is (left + right)/2. If now * a(mid) >=x, then left = mid+1, else right=mid. The loop continues until left >= right. After the loop, the first index where now*a(c) <x is left. The count would be n - (left-1). Because the elements from left to n are those where the product is <x. Wait, no. Wait, in Fortran, after the loop, left is the first index where the condition is met. Let's see:\n\nFor example, in Java, after the loop, left is the first index where a[c] satisfies the condition (now*a[c] <x). In Fortran, the same logic would apply. Let's think with an example.\n\nSuppose now is -2, x is 6. Then a[c] needs to be > -3 (since -2 * a[c] <6 \u2192 a[c] >-3). So the array is sorted in ascending order, so the elements greater than -3 are from some index onwards. The code in Java finds the first index where a[c] >-3 (since now is -2). The count of elements >=x is left (Java code), and the count of elements <x is n-left.\n\nIn Fortran, the binary search would find the first index (say, ix) where a(ix) >-3. Then the elements from ix to n are those that satisfy a[c] >-3. The count is n - ix + 1 (since ix is 1-based). Wait, no. For example, if the array is [-5, -3, -2, 1,4], sorted. x=6, now=-2. The elements that satisfy -2*a[c] <6 \u2192 a[c] >-3. The elements are -2, 1,4. So indices 3,4,5 (Fortran 1-based). So the count is 3 elements. How to find this via binary search.\n\nThe binary search should find the first index where a[c] >-3. So for the array [-5,-3,-2,1,4], the first index where a[c] >-3 is 3. So ix=3. The count is n - ix +1? No. For 5 elements, ix=3, then the count is 5-3 +1 =3, which is correct.\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\ncount = n - ix +1.\n\nBut the code in Java does count += (n - l). So for the example, l is 3 (Java 0-based index 2). So n=5, l=2. So count +=5-2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the binary search, ix is the first 1-based index where a[c] >x/now (since now is negative, x/now is -3, and a[c] >-3).\n\nSo the number of elements where a[c] >-3 is n - ix +1.\n\nBut wait, in the example, ix=3. So from ix=3 to 5, there are 3 elements (3,4,5). So count is 3. Which is n - ix +1 =5-3+1=3.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the case when now is negative, the count is (n - ix +1). So tot += (n - ix +1).\n\nBut wait, in Java, the code for now <0:\n\ntot += (n - l).\n\nIn the example, l is 2 (0-based index). So n=5, l=2. n - l =3. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Fortran, ix is the first 1-based index where a(c) satisfies a(c) > x/now (since now is negative). So the count is n - ix +1. So the code in Fortran would be:\n\ncount = n - ix +1\n\ntot = tot + count\n\nBut how to compute ix via binary search.\n\nThe binary search in Fortran for now <0:\n\nWe want to find the first index where a(c) > (x / now). Because now is negative, x/now is negative. So the condition now*a(c) <x is equivalent to a(c) > x/now.\n\nSo the binary search needs to find the first index where a(c) > (x / now).\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nleft = 1\n\nright = n +1\n\ndo while (left < right)\n\n    mid = (left + right)/2\n\n    if (a(mid) <= target) then ! target is x / now\n\n        left = mid +1\n\n    else\n\n        right = mid\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nix = left\n\nSo the first index where a(c) > target is ix. The count is n - ix +1.\n\nSo for now <0, the code in Fortran would compute target = x / now, then perform the binary search to find ix. Then count = n - ix +1, and add this to tot.\n\nBut need to handle integer division in Fortran. For example, if x=5, now=-2 \u2192 x/now is -2.5, but since it's integer division, it's -2 (since Fortran truncates towards zero). Wait, no. In Java, integer division of 5 / (-2) is -2 (since (-2)*(-2) is 4, 5-4=1, remainder 1). So 5 / -2 is -2.\n\nIn Fortran, 5 / (-2) is also -2. So integer division works the same way.\n\nSo target is x / now.\n\nSo the code for now <0 is:\n\ncompute target = x / now\n\nbinary search for the first index where a(c) > target.\n\nthe count is n - ix +1.\n\nBut how to compute the target. Let's see.\n\nBut since now is integer, x is integer, the division is integer division.\n\nSo in Fortran, target = x / now.\n\nBut when now is zero? Well, in the original code, the array is sorted. So if now is zero, then now * a(c) is zero. So if x is positive, then zero <x, so all elements would be counted. But in the original code, the array is sorted, and when now is zero, how is it handled?\n\nWait, in the Java code, the check function has a loop for each i from 0 to n-1. For now = a[i], which can be zero. So in the check function:\n\nif (now >=0) then the code does one thing, else another.\n\nBut if now is zero, then:\n\nnow is >=0. So the code proceeds to the first branch.\n\nNow, when now is zero, and x is a value. For example, x is positive. Then now * a(c) =0 <x, so all a(c) will be counted. So the binary search will set l to n.\n\nSo the code adds l (n) to tot.\n\nBut then, the code subtracts 1 if a[i] * a[i] <x. Because in the Java code:\n\nif (a[i] * a[i] <x) \u2192 tot--.\n\nSo when a[i] is zero and x is positive, a[i]^2 is zero <x \u2192 tot is decremented by 1.\n\nBut in the case where now is zero and x is positive, the code adds l (n) to tot, then subtracts 1 if a[i]^2 <x.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nSo back to Fortran.\n\nNow, in the check function, for each element a(ix), where ix ranges from 1 to n:\n\nnow = a(ix)\n\nif (now >=0):\n\n   target = x / now (but now can be zero! So division by zero possible. Wait, in Java, now can be zero. How does the code handle that?\n\nWait, in the Java code, now is a[i]. The code first checks if now >=0.\n\nIf now is zero, then in the binary search:\n\nfor each c in 0..n-1:\n\n   now*a[c] =0*a[c] =0. So the code checks if 0 <x. So if x is positive, then 0 <x is true \u2192 all elements a[c] will be considered (since 0 <x). So the binary search will return l =n (since all a[c] will have product 0 <x \u2192 l becomes n.\n\nSo in Java, when now is zero and x>0, the code adds n to tot, then subtracts 1 if a[i]^2 <x (which is 0 <x, so yes \u2192 tot becomes tot +n -1.\n\nBut in Fortran, if now is zero, then in the code:\n\ntarget = x / now \u2192 division by zero. That's an error.\n\nSo the original code has a bug when a[i] is zero and x is being checked. Wait, but in the Java code, when now is zero, the code enters the first branch (now >=0). Then, in the binary search, the code checks if now*a[c] <x. Since now is zero, now*a[c] is zero. So the code checks if zero <x. So if x is positive, then all elements a[c] will have product zero <x \u2192 so l becomes n. So the code adds n to tot, then subtracts 1 if a[i]^2 <x (which is true if x>0 \u2192 tot becomes tot +n -1.\n\nBut in Fortran, when now is zero, target = x / now \u2192 division by zero. So this is a problem.\n\nSo the code needs to handle the case when now is zero.\n\nSo in Fortran, when now is zero, the code should check if x is positive. Because in this case, all elements a(c) will satisfy now*a(c) =0 <x. So the count is n. So the code can add n to tot. But then subtract 1 if a(ix)^2 <x (i.e., if 0 <x).\n\nSo in Fortran, for the case when now is zero, need to handle it separately.\n\nSo modifying the Fortran check function:\n\nfor each ix in 1..n:\n\n   now = a(ix)\n\n   if (now >=0) then\n\n       if (now ==0) then\n\n           if (x >0) then\n\n               cnt = n\n\n           else\n\n               cnt =0\n\n           end if\n\n       else\n\n           target = x / now\n\n           if (x >0 .and. mod(x, now) /=0 .and. (now*target <x)) then\n\n               ! if x is not divisible by now, and now*target is less than x, then target needs to be adjusted.\n\n               ! For example, x=5, now=2 \u2192 target=2 (5/2=2.5 \u2192 truncated to 2). 2*2=4 <5 \u2192 so target is 2, but elements <=2 will be counted. But we need to find elements <x/now (which is 2.5). So a(c) <2.5 \u2192 a(c) <=2. So target remains 2.\n\n               ! But for now positive, binary search finds elements < target. But x/now is not an integer. So how to handle this?\n\n               ! Wait, in Java, the code uses integer division, so x/now is truncated towards zero. So the code uses x/now as the target. But if now is positive and x is not divisible by now, then x/now is the floor division.\n\n               ! For example, x=5, now=2 \u2192 x/now=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. So any a[c] <2 will be counted. But a[c] =2 would have product 4 <5 \u2192 but in the code, the binary search checks if now*a[c] <x. So if now=2, a[c]=2 \u2192 4 <5 \u2192 yes. So the code would count a[c]=2 as well.\n\n               Wait, in Java code, now=2, a[c]=2, x=5. The code checks if 2*2 <5 \u2192 yes. So l would be incremented. So the binary search would include a[c]=2 in the count.\n\nBut according to the binary search logic, the target is x/now=2.5. So the code's binary search for now=2 and x=5:\n\nlooking for the first index where a[c] >=2.5. Since the array is sorted, all a[c] <2.5 would be included. So for a[c] =2, which is less than 2.5 \u2192 included. So the count is l=3 (if array has elements 1,2,3). For example, array [1,2,3], now=2, x=5. The target is 2.5. The binary search for the first index >=2.5 is index 2 (a[2]=3). So l=2. So count is 2 elements (indices 0 and 1: 1 and 2).\n\nBut 2*2=4 <5 \u2192 so those elements are counted.\n\nSo the binary search in Java for now positive and x/now not integer still works because it uses integer division.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code would have to handle this correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed as before, but when now is zero, handle it as a special case.\n\nSo in Fortran's check function:\n\ndo ix =1, n\n\n    now = a(ix)\n\n    if (now >=0) then\n\n        if (now ==0) then\n\n            if (x >0) then\n\n                cnt =n\n\n            else\n\n                cnt =0\n\n            end if\n\n        else\n\n            target = x / now\n\n            ! binary search to find first index where a(c) >= target.\n\n            ! compute left-1 as the count.\n\n            left =1\n\n            right =n+1\n\n            do while (left < right)\n\n                mid = (left + right)/2\n\n                if (a(mid) < target) then\n\n                    left = mid +1\n\n                else\n\n                    right = mid\n\n                end if\n\n            end do\n\n            cnt = left-1\n\n            ! check if now * a(c) <x for the elements counted.\n\n            ! because in cases where target is not exactly x/now, like when x is not divisible by now.\n\n            ! need to adjust for cases where now*target <x?\n\n            ! For example, x=5, now=2 \u2192 target=2. a(c) <2 \u2192 product <4 <5. a(c) =2 \u2192 product 4 <5. So the binary search count (left-1) is 2 (elements 1 and 2 if array is [1,2,3]).\n\n            ! but in that case, a(c) =2 is included in the count.\n\n            ! Wait, the binary search finds the first index where a(c) >= target (2). So the elements before that are <2. So the count is left-1=2 (elements 1 and 2 are 1 and 2). But 2 is equal to target. So the code in Java would have l=2, which counts a[0], a[1], a[2] (0-based) if they are 1,2,3. So l=2 (indices 0 and 1) \u2192 count is 2.\n\n            ! But in this example, now=2, x=5. The product 2*2=4 <5. So the code in Java counts a[0], a[1], a[2] (if a[2] is 2). Wait, no. The binary search code in Java for now=2 and x=5:\n\n            initial l=0, r=3 (n=3).\n\n            mid=1 (0+3)/2=1. a[1]=2. 2*2=4 <5 \u2192 yes. l becomes 2.\n\n            Now l=2, r=3.\n\n            mid=2. a[2]=3. 3*2=6 >=5 \u2192 r=2.\n\n            Loop ends. l=2 \u2192 count is 2 elements (0 and 1). So the code in Java counts 2 elements. But the actual elements where product is <5 are 1,2 (products 2,4). So the count is correct.\n\n            So in Fortran, the code's binary search gives left-1=2 (elements 1 and 2), which is correct.\n\n            So the code in Fortran is correct.\n\n            So for now>0, handle the binary search as before.\n\n        end if\n\n        tot = tot + cnt\n\n        if (now * now <x) then\n\n            tot = tot -1\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        target = x / now\n\n        ! binary search to find first index where a(c) > target.\n\n        left =1\n\n        right =n+1\n\n        do while (left < right)\n\n            mid = (left + right)/2\n\n            if (a(mid) <= target) then\n\n                left = mid +1\n\n            else\n\n                right = mid\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        cnt = n - left +1\n\n        tot = tot + cnt\n\n        if (now * now <x) then\n\n            tot = tot -1\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, after processing all elements, check if tot//2 <k. If so, return true.\n\nBut in Fortran, the variables need to be declared properly. For example, tot is a 64-bit integer to avoid overflow.\n\nAnother thing: in the original Java code, after counting all pairs (including (i,j) and (j,i) pairs), the code subtracts the case where i=j (since a[i] *a[i] is counted once, but in the problem, it's likely that i and j are distinct pairs). So the code checks if a[i]^2 <x and subtracts 1 for each such occurrence. Then, since the pairs (i,j) and (j,i) are counted twice, the code divides by 2 and compares with k.\n\nIn Fortran, this part is handled similarly.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, the module to hold the variables:\n\nmodule global_vars\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: int64 = selected_int_kind(18)\n    integer(int64) :: n, k\n    integer(int64), allocatable :: a(:)\nend module global_vars\n\nThen, the main program:\n\nprogram ABC155_D\n    use global_vars\n    implicit none\n    integer(int64) :: i, INF, l, r, c, answer\n    integer(int64), parameter :: one = 1_int64\n    integer(int64), parameter :: mod = 1e9 + 7\n    integer :: DX(4) = [-1, 0, 1, 0], DY(4) = [0, -1, 0, 1]\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) n, k\n    allocate(a(n))\n    do i=1,n\n        read(*,*) a(i)\n    end do\n\n    ! Sort the array\n    call quicksort(a, 1, n)\n\n    !

Implement a quicksort for the array a.\n\nsubroutine quicksort(a, first, last)\n    use global_vars, only: int64\n    implicit none\n    integer(int64), intent(inout) :: a(*)\n    integer(int64), intent(in) :: first, last\n    integer(int64) :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n    if (first < last) then\n        pivot = a(first)\n        i = first\n        j = last\n\n        do while (i < j)\n            do while (a(i) <= pivot .and. i < last)\n                i = i +1\n            end do\n            do while (a(j) > pivot)\n                j = j -1\n            end do\n            if (i < j) then\n                temp = a(i)\n                a(i) = a(j)\n                a(j) = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        temp = a(first)\n        a(first) = a(j)\n        a(j) = temp\n\n        call quicksort(a, first, j-1)\n        call quicksort(a, j+1, last)\n    end if\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nBut the quicksort implementation should correctly sort the array in ascending order, which is what the original Java code does.\n\nNow, let's handle potential integer overflow. The variables are declared as integer(int64), which is 64-bit integers.\n\nBut in Fortran, the division of integers is done with /, which truncates towards zero, same as Java. So the code should work as expected.\n\nNow, compiling all of this into a single code.\n\nBut there's an issue with the quicksort subroutine. Since the array is allocated in the main program and passed to the quicksort, but the subroutine uses a(*) which is compatible.\n\nAlternatively, in the module, the array a is declared as allocatable, so the quicksort subroutine can access it via the module. But in the current setup, the quicksort subroutine is outside the module. So perhaps it's better to pass the array to the quicksort subroutine.\n\nWait, in the main program, after reading the array, it's sorted using a quicksort. So the quicksort subroutine needs to take the array as an argument.\n\nSo modifying the quicksort subroutine:\n\nsubroutine quicksort(a, n)\n    use global_vars, only: int64\n    implicit none\n    integer(int64), intent(inout) :: a(n)\n    integer(int64), intent(in) :: n\n    call quicksort_recursive(a, 1, n)\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nsubroutine quicksort_recursive(a, first, last)\n    use global_vars, only: int64\n    implicit none\n    integer(int64), intent(inout) :: a(*)\n    integer(int64), intent(in) :: first, last\n    integer(int64) :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n    if (first < last) then\n        pivot = a(first)\n        i = first\n        j = last\n\n        do while (i < j)\n            do while (a(i) <= pivot .and. i < last)\n                i = i +1\n            end do\n            do while (a(j) > pivot)\n                j = j -1\n            end do\n            if (i < j) then\n                temp = a(i)\n                a(i) = a(j)\n                a(j) = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        temp = a(first)\n        a(first) = a(j)\n        a(j) = temp\n\n        call quicksort_recursive(a, first, j-1)\n        call quicksort_recursive(a, j+1, last)\n    end if\nend subroutine quicksort_recursive\n\nBut in the main program, the call to quicksort would be:\n\ncall quicksort(a, n)\n\nBut in the current code, the array a is in the module. So perhaps the main program's code would have to pass the array to the quicksort.\n\nAlternatively, since a is part of the module, the quicksort can access it directly.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Perhaps reorganize the code to have the quicksort work on the module's a array.\n\nBut this would require modifying the quicksort to use the module.\n\nAlternatively, modify the quicksort subroutine to take the array as an argument.\n\nBut in the main program, the array is allocated and part of the module. So in the main program, after reading the array, call quicksort(a, n).\n\nBut in the code, the main program uses the global_vars module, where a is declared. So the main program's code has a accessible.\n\nBut the quicksort subroutine can take the array as an argument.\n\nSo the main program's code calls:\n\ncall quicksort(a, n)\n\nThen, the quicksort subroutine sorts the array.\n\nBut the quicksort implementation may need to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is 1-based in the module, the quicksort_recursive is called with first=1, last=n.\n\nBut perhaps the current quicksort implementation is correct.\n\nBut this is getting into the weeds. Let's proceed.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nThe final Fortran code would have:\n\n- A module to hold global variables n, k, a.\n\n- A main program that reads input, sorts the array, performs binary search.\n\n- A check function that computes whether the number of pairs is less than k.\n\n- A quicksort subroutine to sort the array.\n\nNow, possible errors:\n\n- The binary search for now<0 may have a mistake in the condition.\n\n- Integer overflow: using 64-bit integers should handle large values.\n\n- Division by zero when now is zero: handled via the special case.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the check function, the code for now<0 computes target =x / now. But when now is negative and x is negative, the division could be positive, but need to ensure correct direction.\n\nBut the code's binary search for now<0 should handle all cases.\n\nFinally, testing the code with sample inputs.\n\nFor example, sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 1 -5\n\nAfter sorting: -5, 1,3.\n\nThe binary search should compute the k-th smallest product.\n\nBut this is beyond the scope of the current task.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fortran code should be structured as described, with attention to the 1-based indexing, handling of zero, and proper binary search conditions."
