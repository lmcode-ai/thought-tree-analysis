So when the user inputs the nth element, the first is index 0, then 1, etc. So in Fortran, maybe we can have an array to store the positions where the input is 1, but using 0-based indices. But Fortran arrays are easier to handle as 1-based. Hmm.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nSo, the program reads an integer n, then reads n integers. It collects the indices of the elements that are 1 into a list called arr. If there are no 1s, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the product of the differences between consecutive indices of 1s and prints that product.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to handle input in Fortran. Java uses a Scanner to read input, but Fortran reads from standard input using READ statements. So I'll need to read the integers one by one.\n\nIn the Java code, they loop through n elements and check if each is 1. If yes, add the index (starting from 0) to arr. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the original code uses 0-based indices. Wait, in the Java code, the loop is for (i=0 to n-1), and if the input is 1, the index i is added. So when translating, we need to keep track of the 0-based indices. So when the user inputs the nth element, the first is index 0, then 1, etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, maybe we can have an array to store the positions where the input is 1, but using 0-based indices. But Fortran arrays are easier to handle as 1-based. Hmm. Let's think: the Java code's arr.get(i) - arr.get(i-1) gives the difference between consecutive indices of 1s. So for example, if the 1s are at positions 2 and 5, the difference is 3, which is multiplied into the result. So the order and the actual indices matter.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps we can collect the indices in a list (array), but starting from 0. So when reading the input, for each element, if it's 1, record its position (starting from 0). Then, compute the product of the differences between consecutive elements in this array.\n\nSo first, the steps:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n2. Read n integers. For each integer (i-th, starting from 0?), check if it's 1. If yes, save the index.\n3. If there are no 1s, output 0.\n4. Else, multiply the differences between consecutive 1s' indices and output the product.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to handle dynamic arrays? Because we don't know how many 1s there are. So we can use an allocatable array. Start with a size of 0, and every time we find a 1, we append its index (0-based) to the array.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, expanding arrays dynamically can be a bit tedious. For each element, we can check, and if it's 1, append the index to the array.\n\nSo, let's outline the code.\n\nFirst, read n:\n\ninteger :: n\nread(*,*) n\n\nThen, loop over n elements. For each element, read the value, check if it's 1. Also track the current position (0-based). For example:\n\ninteger :: i, val, pos\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\ninteger :: count_ones = 0\n\nallocate(arr(0)) ! Start with empty, but perhaps better to allocate as we go.\n\nWait, perhaps using a dynamic array approach. Maybe we can first count the number of ones, then allocate the array and fill it. But in Java, they use a list that grows dynamically, which is easier. But in Fortran, perhaps it's easier to first count the number of ones, then read again and collect the indices. But reading again would require storing the input first. Alternatively, process each input as it's read, and track the indices.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire array first, then process it. Let's see.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\nread(*,*) n\nallocate(a(n))\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) a(i)\nend do\n\nThen, collect the indices (0-based or 1-based?) where a(i) is 1.\n\nWait, in Java, the indices are 0-based. For example, if the input is [1, 0, 1], then arr will have 0 and 2. The difference between them is 2, so the product is 2. So the result is 2.\n\nIn Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the positions would be 1 and 3. The difference would be 2. So the product is same. Wait, no. Because in Java, the positions are 0-based. So when the input is first element (i=0) is 1, etc. So if I read the elements into a(1) to a(n) in Fortran, then the index in the loop would be 1 to n, but the actual position (as per Java's code) is i-1 (0-based). So for the Fortran code, the indices to collect are (i-1) where a(i) is 1.\n\nSo for example, in the first element (i=1 in Fortran), the position is 0. So during the loop from 1 to n, if a(i) is 1, append (i-1) to the array.\n\nSo first, let's collect the indices into an array.\n\nWe can first count how many ones there are.\n\ncount_ones = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n    if (a(i) == 1) count_ones = count_ones + 1\nend do\n\nif (count_ones == 0) then\n    print *, 0\nelse\n    allocate(arr(count_ones))\n    j = 1\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (a(i) == 1) then\n            arr(j) = i-1  ! 0-based index\n            j = j + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Now compute product of differences between consecutive elements\n    result = 1\n    do i = 2, count_ones\n        diff = arr(i) - arr(i-1)\n        result = result * diff\n    end do\n    print *, result\nend if\n\nBut wait, in Java, when the array arr is empty, output is 0. So in Fortran, if count_ones is zero, print 0. Otherwise, compute the product.\n\nBut what if there's only one 1? Then, the product is 1? Because the loop from i=1 to size-1. Wait, in Java code, when the arr.size() is 1, the loop for i from 1 to arr.size()-1 (since i starts at 1 and the size is 1, so the loop doesn't run, and result remains 1. So the output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, when count_ones is 1, the loop i runs from 2 to count_ones, which is 1, so the loop doesn't execute. So result is 1, which is correct.\n\nBut how to handle the initial array. Wait, the first approach is to read the entire array into a, then process it. But the problem is that in Java, the input is read in a loop. But in Fortran, when reading from standard input, after reading n, the next n integers can be read in a single read statement.\n\nBut in some programming contest scenarios, the input is given as a single line. For example, if the input is:\n\n3\n\n1 0 1\n\nThen, the Java code reads n=3, then loops 3 times to read each integer. The Fortran code can read n, then read the next line as n integers.\n\nSo the approach of reading the entire array into a variable is feasible.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read n integers into array a.\n\n3. Collect the 0-based indices where a(i) is 1.\n\n4. If no 1s, print 0.\n\n5. Else, compute product of consecutive differences and print.\n\nSo the Fortran code would look something like this:\n\nprogram codeforces_617_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, j, count_ones, diff\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), arr(:)\n    integer(kind=8) :: result  ! To handle large products, since in Java it's a long.\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(a(n))\n    read(*,*) (a(i), i=1, n)\n\n    count_ones = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (a(i) == 1) count_ones = count_ones + 1\n    end do\n\n    if (count_ones == 0) then\n        print *, 0\n    else\n        allocate(arr(count_ones))\n        j = 1\n        do i = 1, n\n            if (a(i) == 1) then\n                arr(j) = i - 1  ! 0-based index\n                j = j + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        result = 1\n        do i = 2, count_ones\n            diff = arr(i) - arr(i-1)\n            result = result * diff\n        end do\n        print *, result\n    end if\n\nend program codeforces_617_B\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the default integer is usually 4 bytes, but if the product is very large (since each difference could be up to n-1, and multiplied multiple times), we need to use an 8-byte integer. So in Java, the result is a long, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, we can declare result as integer(kind=8).\n\nBut how to handle that. In the code above, result is declared as integer(kind=8). But in Fortran, the kind values can vary. Alternatively, use integer*8, but that's not standard. But for portability, perhaps use selected_int_kind.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, using integer(kind=8) is acceptable for most compilers.\n\nAnother thing: when reading the array a, the code uses read(*,*) (a(i), i=1, n). This reads n integers from the input, which can be in the same line or in separate lines. So that should be okay.\n\nTesting this code with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n1 0 1\n\nThe arr would collect 0 and 2. Then differences is 2. So product is 2. The code should output 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4\n\n1 1 1 1\n\nThe arr would be [0,1,2,3]. The differences are 1,1,1. Product is 1*1*1=1. So code outputs 1.\n\nAnother test case where there's one 1: input 1 1. Then arr has [0]. Product is 1, so code outputs 1.\n\nAnother test case with no 1s: output 0.\n\nAnother case: 5 0 1 0 1 0. The arr is [1,3]. Difference is 2. Product is 2.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases correctly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling large n. For example, if n is up to 1e5, but in practice, the code should handle it as per the problem's constraints.\n\n- The product can be very large, hence the need for 64-bit integers.\n\nI think this should work."
