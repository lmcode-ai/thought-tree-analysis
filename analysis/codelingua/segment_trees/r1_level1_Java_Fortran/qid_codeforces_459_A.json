    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. So the program reads four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2, which are the coordinates of two points. Then it checks if these points form a certain condition to find two other points to make a square. \n\nThe first condition checks if x1 and x2 are the same. If they are, then the points are vertically aligned. Then the difference in y's is calculated. The other two points would be at x1 + difference (or x2 + difference, since x1=x2) and same y's. So those points are (x1+dif, y1) and (x1+dif, y2). Then print them.\n\nThe second condition is if y1 and y2 are the same. Then the points are horizontal. The difference is the x's difference. Then the other points would be (x1, y1+dif) and (x2, y2+dif). Wait, but if the original points are (x1,y) and (x2,y), then adding dif to y gives two points vertically above each original point. That makes a square.\n\nThird condition checks if the absolute difference between x's and y's are equal. So the two points form a diagonal. Then the other points would be (x1,y2) and (x2,y1), forming a square.\n\nOtherwise, output -1.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read the four integers, then apply the same logic.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses read statements. Let's see. To read from standard input, we can use read(*,*) x1, y1, x2, y2.\n\nFor output, we can use print statements or write to a unit. But the Java code uses a PrintWriter, which is like formatted output. In Fortran, we can use print with format specifiers.\n\nBut in the Java code, when they print, they concatenate the numbers into a string. For example, (x1 + dif) + \" \" + y1 + \" \" + (x1 + dif) + \" \" + y2. So the output is four integers separated by spaces. In Fortran, when we print, we can format it as four integers separated by spaces.\n\nSo when the condition is met, we need to print four integers. If not, print -1.\n\nNow, the conditions:\n\nFirst, check if x1 == x2. Then compute dif as abs(y1 - y2). Then output x1 + dif, y1, x1+dif, y2.\n\nWait, wait. In Java, the code adds dif to x1. So if x1 and x2 are the same (vertical line), then the other two points are to the right or left of this line. The distance between the original points is dif (y's difference). So the square's side length is dif. So the other two points are x1 + dif (or x1 - dif, but the code uses +dif) and same y's. So the new points are (x1 + dif, y1) and (x1 + dif, y2). Then when you connect all four points, they form a square.\n\nIn Fortran, we need to check if x1 equals x2. So using (x1 == x2) as a logical condition.\n\nThen, compute dif as abs(y1 - y2). Then print the four numbers.\n\nSimilarly for the case where y1 == y2.\n\nThe third condition is when the absolute differences of x and y are equal. So the points form a square's diagonal. Then the other two points are (x1, y2) and (x2, y1).\n\nOtherwise, output -1.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can structure this with if-else if-else blocks.\n\nNow, let's think about the structure of the Fortran program.\n\nProgram structure:\n\nProgram starts with a program name, then variable declarations. Variables x1, y1, x2, y2, dif.\n\nIn Fortran, variables are declared with type. Since they are integers, use integer :: x1, y1, x2, y2, dif.\n\nThen read the inputs: read(*,*) x1, y1, x2, y2.\n\nThen check the conditions:\n\nif (x1 == x2) then\n\n    compute dif = abs(y1 - y2)\n\n    print the four numbers: x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2.\n\nelse if (y1 == y2) then\n\n    compute dif = abs(x1 - x2)\n\n    print x1, y1 + dif, x2, y2 + dif.\n\nelse if (abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)) then\n\n    print x1, y2, x2, y1.\n\nelse\n\n    print -1.\n\nend if\n\nBut wait, in the second case (y1 == y2), the code prints (x1) + \" \" + (y1 + dif) + \" \" + (x2) + \" \" + (y2 + dif). So the two new points are (x1, y1+dif) and (x2, y2+dif). But since y1=y2 (because we are in this condition), y2+dif is y1+dif. So it's (x1, y1+dif) and (x2, y1+dif). Which makes sense for the square.\n\nSo in Fortran, when outputting, we need to format the numbers as integers separated by spaces.\n\nIn Fortran, the print statement can use a format string. For example:\n\nprint '(I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0)', x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2\n\nBut when printing -1, it's just a single integer. So the format would have to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, in each case, we can format the output as required.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because in some cases we need to print four integers, in others one.\n\nSo perhaps, in each branch, construct the output accordingly.\n\nIn the first case:\n\nprint '(4(I0, 1X))', x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the format '4(I0,1X)' would produce four I0 followed by a space, but that's four times. So for four integers, each followed by a space. But that would leave an extra space at the end. Alternatively, using '4I0' would print them concatenated. But perhaps the format should be four integers separated by spaces. So the format can be '(I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0)'.\n\nBut when using list-directed output (without a format), it's possible. For example, print *, x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2. But list-directed output may add commas or vary based on compiler. To ensure that the numbers are separated by spaces, using a formatted output is better.\n\nSo for the first case, using:\n\nprint '(I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0)', x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2\n\nSimilarly for the second case.\n\nIn the third case, print x1, y2, x2, y1.\n\nElse, print -1.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nPotential code:\n\nprogram codeforces_459_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x1, y1, x2, y2, dif\n\n    read(*,*) x1, y1, x2, y2\n\n    if (x1 == x2) then\n        dif = abs(y1 - y2)\n        print '(I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0)', x1 + dif, y1, x1 + dif, y2\n    else if (y1 == y2) then\n        dif = abs(x1 - x2)\n        print '(I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0)', x1, y1 + dif, x2, y2 + dif\n    else if (abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)) then\n        print '(I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0, \" \", I0)', x1, y2, x2, y1\n    else\n        print '(I0)', -1\n    end if\n\nend program codeforces_459_A\n\nWait, but in the second condition, the code adds dif to y1 and y2. But since in this condition, y1 and y2 are equal, so adding dif to both would make them the same value. So (x1, y1 + dif) and (x2, y1 + dif), which are the other two corners.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nFor example, when x1=0, y1=0, x2=0, y2=2. Then dif is 2. The output is (0+2, 0), (0+2, 2), so 2 0 2 2. Which forms a square.\n\nAnother case: x1=1, y1=1, x2=3, y2=1. Then y1=y2. dif is 2. The other points are (1, 1+2=3) and (3,1+2=3). So points (1,3), (3,3) forming a square.\n\nThird case: x1=0, y1=0, x2=2, y2=2. Then the third condition is met. Output (0,2) and (2,0). Which are the other two corners.\n\nIf none of the conditions are met, output -1.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the Fortran code uses 'I0' format, which removes leading spaces. But when numbers are negative, they would be printed with a minus. But in this problem, the inputs are coordinates; perhaps negative numbers are allowed. The code should handle them correctly.\n\nThus, the code seems correct."
