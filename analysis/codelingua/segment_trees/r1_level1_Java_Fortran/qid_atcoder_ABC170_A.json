    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at what the Java code does.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads a line of input, splits it into an array of strings. Then it counts how many elements there are until it encounters a \"0\". The result is the position of the first \"0\" in the array, and then it prints that position.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I need to read the input line, split it into parts, find the index of the first zero, and output that index.\n\nHmm. Fortran's I/O is a bit different. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, reading the input. In Java, they use BufferedReader to read a line. In Fortran, I can read a whole line into a character variable. So, declare a character variable, say, line, of sufficient length. Then read using read(*,'(a)') line.\n\nThen, split the line into tokens. Fortran doesn't have a built-in split function, so I need to parse the string manually. Let's think: the input is space-separated integers. So, each token is a sequence of non-space characters. I can loop through the line, extract each token, and store them in an array.\n\nBut how big can the array be? The problem doesn't specify, but in the Java code, it's split into an array. Let's assume that the maximum number of elements is, say, 100. Or maybe count the number of elements first. Alternatively, process the line on the fly.\n\nWait, the Java code splits on spaces. So, in Fortran, I can read all the numbers into an integer array. Then, loop through the array to find the index of the first zero, then output that index.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the code increments result (starting at 0) for each element, and breaks when a \"0\" is found. So the result is the position (1-based index) of the first zero. Because, for example, if the input is \"1 2 0 3\", the result would be 3, since the third element is the first zero.\n\nWait, let's see: the Java code initializes result to 0, then for each string in input_array, adds 1 to result. Then checks if the string is \"0\" and breaks. So if the input is \"1 2 0 3\", the loop runs three times. result starts at 0, then becomes 1, 2, 3. Then checks the third element (index 2 in Java's array) which is \"0\", breaks. So the result is 3, which is printed.\n\nSo the problem is, given a list of integers separated by spaces, find the position (1-based) of the first occurrence of zero.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the entire line as a string.\n\n2. Split the string into individual numbers, stored in an array.\n\n3. Find the index of the first zero in the array.\n\n4. Output that index.\n\nBut how to split the string into numbers? Since Fortran doesn't have a split function, perhaps read the line into a character variable, then process it by reading each integer in a loop, using internal reads.\n\nYes. So, here's how to do that:\n\n- Read the entire line into a character variable.\n\n- Use an internal file to read each integer from the string.\n\n- Keep track of the count and the position where each integer is found.\n\nBut handling this can be a bit tricky. Let's think of an approach:\n\nInitialize a position variable, pos, to 1. Then, in a loop, read each integer from the string starting at pos. For each read, check if there was an error (end of line). Also, after reading each integer, check if it's zero. If it is, record the current count and exit the loop. Otherwise, increment the count.\n\nHere's an outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200) :: line\n    integer :: i, idx, ios, count\n    integer :: num\n\n    read(*, '(a)') line  ! Read the entire line\n\n    count = 0\n    idx = 0\n    pos = 1\n\n    do\n        ! Read the next integer from line starting at pos\n        read(line(pos:), *, iostat=ios) num\n        if (ios /= 0) exit\n        count = count + 1\n        if (num == 0) then\n            idx = count\n            exit\n        end if\n        ! Update pos to the next position after the current number\n        pos = pos + scan(line(pos:), ' ')  ! Find the next space\n        ! Skip any consecutive spaces\n        do while (line(pos:pos) == ' ')\n            pos = pos + 1\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    print *, idx\nend program\n\nWait, but the code above might have issues with how pos is updated. Let me think. The scan function returns the position of the first occurrence of a space in line(pos:). So, if the current number is read from pos onwards, the next number starts after the space. But the number could be followed by multiple spaces. So after reading the number, we need to find the next non-space character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to use the index of the next space after pos. Let me see. For example, the line is \" 1 2 0 3\". So, after reading the first number (1), the next position would be after the space. But in the code above, after reading the first number, pos is incremented by the position of the first space in line(pos:). Then, we loop through consecutive spaces.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to split the string into tokens, each of which is a number, and process them one by one. Let's try implementing this.\n\nAnother way: process the line to split into tokens.\n\nBut in Fortran, it's a bit tedious. So, perhaps the code can use a loop to read each integer from the line until there's an error (end of line). For each integer read, increment the count. Check if the integer is zero. If yes, exit the loop and output the count.\n\nBut how to read each integer in sequence from the line. For example, the line is \"1 2 0 3\". Then, read the first integer, which is 1, count becomes 1. Then read 2, count 2. Then 0, count 3. Then exit.\n\nBut how to read each integer from the line in a loop. Here's a possible approach:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200) :: line\n    integer :: num, count, ios\n\n    read(*, '(a)') line  ! Read the entire line\n\n    count = 0\n    ios = 0\n    do\n        ! Read the next integer from the line\n        read(line, *, iostat=ios) num\n        if (ios /= 0) exit\n        count = count + 1\n        if (num == 0) then\n            print *, count\n            stop\n        end if\n        ! Remove the part of the line that's already read\n        line = line(index(line, ' ')+1:)  ! This may not work correctly if there are multiple spaces\n    end do\n\n    ! If no zero found, print 0 or something? But according to the Java code, there must be a zero.\n    ! The problem statement probably ensures that there is a zero. So this code may not handle that, but the original Java code breaks on the first zero, so the input must have at least one zero.\n    print *, count\nend program\n\nWait, but this approach may not work correctly. Because each time you read from 'line', it starts from the beginning. So the first read would get the first integer, but the line is not modified. So you'll read the same integer over and over. Oh, right. So the code is incorrect. So the line variable must be modified each time to remove the already processed part. But the code line = line(index(line, ' ')+1:) is attempting to do that. But index(line, ' ') gives the position of the first space. Then, we take the substring from that position +1 onwards. But if there are multiple spaces, this may skip over them. But perhaps, for example, the line is \"1 2 0 3\", after reading 1, line becomes \" 2 0 3\". Then, the next read would read 2, and line becomes \"0 3\". Then next read 0, count is 3, print and exit.\n\nBut how does the read(line, *, ...) work here? Let's see: the first read from line \"1 2 0 3\" would read 1, then line becomes \" 2 0 3\". The next read from this new line would read 2, then line becomes \"0 3\". Next read 0, then exit.\n\nYes, that's correct. But the index function returns the first occurrence of a space. So in the modified line, the first space is the one between 1 and 2. After reading 1, the line becomes \" 2 0 3\". The index function finds the first space (position 1), then line becomes line(1+1:) which is line(2:), which is \"2 0 3\". Then the next read from line \"2 0 3\" reads 2. Then line becomes \"0 3\" (since index finds the space between 2 and 0). Then read 0, count is 3, print and exit.\n\nYes, that works. But this approach may have issues if there are multiple spaces between numbers, or leading/trailing spaces. For example, if the input line is \"  1   2 0 3  \", then the first read would read 1, line becomes \"  2 0 3  \". Then index finds the first space (position 1), line becomes line(2:), which is \" 2 0 3  \". Next read 2, line becomes \"0 3  \". Then read 0, count is 3. Correct.\n\nBut the problem is that if the line has leading spaces. For example, input line is \" 3 0 5\". Then the first read is 3, line becomes \"0 5\". The next read is 0, count becomes 2. So output 2, which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nBut in Fortran, the line modification may not be correct. Because, when you do line = line(index(line, ' ')+1: ), then if index(line, ' ') returns zero (no space found), then line becomes line(1:), which is the same line. Which would result in an infinite loop. However, in the Java code, the input is split by spaces, so each token is a non-space string, so the line is split into an array of tokens, and the code stops at the first zero. So the input is guaranteed to have a zero. So when the line is processed, the loop will eventually find the zero and exit.\n\nBut in Fortran, if the input is such that after processing some numbers, the remaining line is empty (or has no more numbers), then the read would fail. But in the Java code, the loop stops at the first zero, so the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=1000) :: line\n    integer :: num, count, ios, pos\n\n    read(*, '(a)') line  ! Read the entire line\n\n    count = 0\n    ios = 0\n    do\n        read(line, *, iostat=ios) num\n        if (ios /= 0) exit\n        count = count + 1\n        if (num == 0) then\n            print *, count\n            stop\n        end if\n        ! Find the position of the first space in the current line\n        pos = index(line, ' ')\n        if (pos == 0) exit  ! no more spaces, exit loop\n        line = line(pos+1:)\n        ! Skip any leading spaces in the new line\n        do while (line(1:1) == ' ')\n            line = line(2:)\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    ! If we reach here, no zero was found, but according to problem statement, there should be one.\n    ! So perhaps this is not needed.\n    print *, count\nend program\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop breaks when \"0\" is found. So the input is supposed to have at least one zero. So the Fortran code can assume that and exit once a zero is found.\n\nBut let's test with the example. Suppose input is \"1 2 0 3\". Then the code would process:\n\n1st iteration: read 1, count becomes 1. Not zero. line becomes \"2 0 3\".\n\n2nd iteration: read 2, count 2. Not zero. line becomes \"0 3\".\n\n3rd iteration: read 0, count 3. Print 3 and stop.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: input is \"0 1 2\". Then first read 0, count 1, print 1 and exit.\n\nAnother case: input with leading spaces. Like \" 5 0 3\". The code would read 5, count 1. Not zero. line becomes \"0 3\". Then read 0, count 2. Print 2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, after reading a number, the code updates the line by taking the substring after the first space. Then, it trims leading spaces by looping while line(1:1) is space and removing them. So that leading spaces are skipped.\n\nThis should handle multiple spaces between numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what if the line has trailing spaces? For example, \"0   \". The code would read 0, count 1, and print 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: \"   0\". Then after trimming leading spaces, line becomes \"0\", read 0, count 1.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java code's behavior."
