Because the multiplicative order is the smallest positive integer n such that 10^n \u2261 1 mod K. But here, the code is starting with remainder as 10 mod K, which is 10^1 mod K. Then each step, multiply by 10 again, so the next is 10^2 mod K, etc. So the loop runs until remainder is 1. So ans is the number of steps, which would be the multiplicative order. So the answer is correct if and only if 10 and K are coprime. But in the code, before entering the loop, K has already been checked for factors 2 and 5 (since if K had those factors, the code returns -1). So after the initial checks, K is coprime with 10. So 10 and K are coprime, which is a requirement for the multiplicative order to exist. So the code is correct.",

But perhaps there's a case where K after processing becomes 1. For example, K=7. Then K becomes9. 10 mod9 is 1. ans=1. Correct. Another case: K=1, after processing becomes9. So the same as above. Another case: K=9. Not divisible by 2 or5. So K is multiplied by9. Wait, no. Wait, original K is 9. Wait, initial K is9. mod9 by2 is 1, mod5 is 4. So proceed. Then check if 9 mod7 is 2. So K remains.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The main logic is in the solve() method. The problem seems to be finding the smallest number of digits consisting of 7's that is a multiple of K. Or wait, looking closer, the code checks if K is divisible by 2 or 5 first, returning -1 if so. Then, if K is divisible by 7, it divides K by 7. Then multiplies K by 9. Then finds the minimal length where the remainder cycles to 1, which I think relates to finding the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read K.\n2. Check if K is even or divisible by 5. If yes, return -1.\n3. If K is divisible by 7, divide by 7.\n4. Multiply K by 9.\n5. Find the smallest number of steps where (10^ans) mod K is 1. The remainder starts at 10%K, then each step multiplies by 10 and mod K. The loop continues until remainder is 1. The count of steps is the answer.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the structure.\n\nIn Fortran, we'll need to read an integer K. Then perform those checks. For the loop part, we need a loop that keeps multiplying the remainder by 10 mod K until it equals 1, counting the steps.\n\nFirst, let's handle input and output. The Java code reads from stdin and writes to stdout. In Fortran, we can use read(*,*) to read from standard input and print to standard output using write(*,*) or print statements.\n\nBut in Fortran, the variables need to be declared. Let's outline the steps.\n\nVariables needed: K, ans, remainder.\n\nBut wait, in Java, K is modified: K = K/7 if divisible by 7, then K *=9. So in Fortran, K will be an integer variable that we modify.\n\nLet's start writing.\n\nFirst, read K. Then check if K mod 2 is 0 or mod 5 is 0. If yes, output -1.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the code returns -1 if K is even or divisible by 5. But after that, it checks if K is divisible by 7. Then divides K by 7. Then multiplies by 9. Then proceeds.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nif (K % 2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) return -1;\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K/=7;\n\nK *=9;\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck if K has factors 2 or 5. If yes, answer is -1.\n\nElse, divide K by 7 as much as possible once? Wait, no, if K is divisible by 7, then divide by 7 once. Then multiply by 9. Hmm, why?\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem is related to numbers consisting of 7's. The initial approach in solving such problems often involves considering that a number with n digits of 7 can be written as (10^n -1)/9 *7. So maybe the code is handling this transformation.\n\nBut regardless, the code's logic is as follows. So in Fortran, after reading K, we perform those checks and modifications.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead K from input.\n\nIf mod(K,2) ==0 or mod(K,5) ==0, then print -1.\n\nElse:\n\n   if (mod(K,7) ==0) then K = K/7\n\n   K = K *9\n\n   compute the minimal ans such that 10^ans mod K is 1.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop starts with remainder =10%K, and each step multiplies by 10 mod K. So ans starts at 1, and each step ans increments, until remainder is 1.\n\nWait, the Java code's loop:\n\nremainder = 10 % K\n\nwhile remainder !=1:\n\n   ans++\n\n   remainder = (remainder *10) % K\n\nSo this is equivalent to checking how many multiplications by 10 it takes for the remainder to become 1. Starting from 10, each step multiply by 10 mod K. So the first remainder is 10%K, then 100%K, then 1000%K, etc. The loop stops when the remainder is 1. So ans is the number of steps taken.\n\nThis is similar to finding the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K. Because the multiplicative order is the smallest positive integer n such that 10^n \u2261 1 mod K. But here, the code is starting with remainder as 10 mod K, which is 10^1 mod K. Then each step, multiply by 10 again, so the next is 10^2 mod K, etc. So the loop runs until remainder is 1. So ans is the number of steps, which would be the multiplicative order. So the answer is correct if and only if 10 and K are coprime.\n\nBut in the code, before entering the loop, K has already been checked for factors 2 and 5 (since if K had those factors, the code returns -1). So after the initial checks, K is coprime with 10. So 10 and K are coprime, which is a requirement for the multiplicative order to exist.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, we need to handle the input, then the checks, then the loop.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: K, ans, remainder, original_K\n\n    read(*,*) K\n\n    original_K = K  ! Not sure if needed, but perhaps not.\n\n    if (mod(K,2) == 0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n        print *, -1\n    else\n        if (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n            K = K /7\n        end if\n        K = K *9\n\n        ans =1\n        remainder = mod(10, K)\n\n        do while (remainder /= 1)\n            ans = ans +1\n            remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n            ! Check for infinite loop? Because if K is 1, remainder would be 0?\n            ! Wait, in the Java code, after K is multiplied by 9, what if K becomes 9* (K_original /7) ?\n\n            ! Let's think: After the initial checks, K is not divisible by 2 or 5.\n\n            ! Suppose K was 7. Then divided by 7 gives 1, multiplied by 9 gives 9. Then remainder starts at 10 mod9 =1. So loop exits, ans=1. Which is correct.\n\n            ! Another example: K=3. Then since not divisible by 2 or5. Then K is not divided by 7 (since 3%7 !=0). Multiply by 9 gives 27. Now, 10 mod27=10. Then next step 10*10=100 mod27 is 19. Then 190 mod27 is 190-27*7=190-189=1. So ans=3. So the answer is 3. Which makes sense: 3*37=111, but perhaps in the original problem's context, it's the number of digits.\n\n            ! So the code should work, but we need to handle cases where K becomes 1? For example, K was 7, then becomes 9. Then 10 mod9=1, so ans=1.\n\n            ! So in the code, the loop will terminate as 10 and K are coprime. Because after the initial checks, K is coprime with 2 and 5. Then multiplied by 9 (which is 3^2) and divided by 7 if possible. Wait, perhaps after the processing, K may have factors 3, but 10 and 3 are not coprime. Wait, but 10 and 3 are coprime (gcd(10,3)=1). So if K has factors 3, then 10 and K are still coprime.\n\n            So the code's logic should work.\n\n            ! So the loop will eventually terminate because 10 and K are coprime. So the code will find a solution.\n\n        end do\n\n        print *, ans\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Java, K is an integer, but when divided by 7, K could become a non-integer. But in Java, since K is an int, division by 7 is integer division. Similarly in Fortran, when K is divided by 7, if mod(K,7) is 0, then K is integer.\n\nSo in Fortran, K is an integer variable. So that's okay.\n\nSo putting this all together.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the modulo operation for negative numbers can behave differently. So we need to ensure that K is positive.\n\nBut since K is read from input, and the problem probably expects K to be a positive integer. So the code should work.\n\nTesting edge cases.\n\nCase 1: K=7.\n\nJava code:\n\nCheck 7%2 and 7%5: 7 mod2 is 1, mod5 is 2. So no. Then check if 7%7 ==0: yes. So K becomes 1. Multiply by9: K=9. Then remainder is 10 mod9=1. So ans is 1. So output is 1.\n\nIn Fortran code, same steps.\n\nCase 2: K=3. Original code.\n\nJava code: K=3. Not divisible by 2 or5. K not divisible by7. Multiply by9: 27. remainder=10 mod27=10. loop: ans=1, remainder=10. Not 1. ans becomes 2, remainder=10*10=100 mod27= 100-3*27=100-81=19. Not 1. ans becomes3, remainder=19*10=190 mod27. 27*7=189. 190-189=1. So remainder=1. loop ends. ans=3. So output is3.\n\nFortran code would do the same.\n\nAnother test: K=1.\n\nIn Java code: K=1. Check 1%2=1, 1%5=1. So no. Then check 1%7 !=0. So K=1*9=9. remainder=10 mod9=1. ans=1. So output 1.\n\nWait, but original problem's logic may vary, but according to the code, that's correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle these cases.\n\nSo the translation seems straightforward.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nIn Fortran, variables are declared first. So:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: K, ans, remainder\n\n    read(*,*) K\n\n    if (mod(K,2) == 0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n        write(*,*) -1\n    else\n        if (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n            K = K /7\n        end if\n        K = K *9\n        ans =1\n        remainder = mod(10, K)\n        do while (remainder /=1)\n            ans = ans +1\n            remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n        end do\n        write(*,*) ans\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but what if K becomes 0 after some operation? For example, if K is 7, then divided by7 is 1, multiplied by9 is9. That's okay.\n\nBut what if K is 0 initially? The code would crash. But according to the problem statement, K is a positive integer.\n\nSo assuming that the input is valid, this code should work.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where K after processing becomes 1. For example, K=7. Then K becomes9. 10 mod9 is 1. ans=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: K=1, after processing becomes9. So the same as above.\n\nAnother case: K=9. Not divisible by 2 or5. So K is multiplied by9. Wait, no. Wait, original K is 9.\n\nWait, initial K is9. mod9 by2 is 1, mod5 is 4. So proceed. Then check if 9 mod7 is 2. So K remains. Multiply by9: 81. Now, compute remainder=10 mod81=10. Loop steps:\n\nans=1, remainder=10.\n\nans=2: 10*10=100 mod81=19.\n\nans=3: 190 mod81: 190-2*81=190-162=28.\n\nans=4: 280 mod81: 81*3=243, 280-243=37.\n\nans=5: 370 mod81: 81*4=324, 370-324=46.\n\nans=6: 460 mod81: 81*5=405, 460-405=55.\n\nans=7:550 mod81: 81*6=486, 550-486=64.\n\nans=8:640 mod81: 81*7=567, 640-567=73.\n\nans=9:73*10=730 mod81. 81*9=729, 730-729=1. So remainder=1. Loop ends. ans=9. So output is9.\n\nWhich is correct, since 10^9 \u22611 mod81. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: when K is 1 after multiplying by9. For example, K=1 (input). Then code checks 1 mod2 and 5: no. Then mod7 is not 0. Multiply by9: K=9. Then 10 mod9 is1. So ans=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should work.\n\nNow, possible differences in modulo handling between Java and Fortran. In Java, the % operator returns a result with the same sign as the dividend. In Fortran, mod(a,b) returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. But in our code, K is positive after processing, so remainder is computed as mod(remainder*10, K), which is positive. So no issue. Because K is always positive.\n\nYes. Because K is initially read as a positive integer (assuming input is valid), and then divided by7 (if applicable) which is positive, multiplied by9, which is positive. So K is always positive. Therefore, mod in Fortran will return a positive remainder. So the loop works as intended.\n\nTherefore, the code should correctly translate the Java logic into Fortran."
