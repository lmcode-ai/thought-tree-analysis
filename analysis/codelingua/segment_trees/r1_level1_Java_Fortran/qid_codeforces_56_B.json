    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program reads an integer len from input, then reads an array of integers of that length. It then looks for a subarray that is reversed. The idea seems to be finding a segment where the elements are in reverse order. If such a segment is found, it outputs the start and end indices (l and r), otherwise 0 0.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I'll need to replicate this logic. Let's break down the steps.\n\nFirst, reading the input. In Java, they use Scanner to read integers. Fortran uses READ statements. So the first part would be reading the length, then the array elements.\n\nThen, initializing variables. The Java code has l and r initialized to 0, and flags. In Fortran, we can declare these as integers and logical variables.\n\nThe loop in Java is a for loop with a label. The loop checks each element to see if it's not in the expected position (i+1). When the first discrepancy is found, l is set to i+1. Then, when another discrepancy is found, r is set. Then, there's a check if the difference between a[r-1] and a[r-2] is positive. If so, set isTrue to true and break out of the loop.\n\nWait, that part might need some thinking. Let's see: after setting r, the code checks if a[r-1] - a[r-2] is positive. Since the subarray is supposed to be reversed, the elements should be in decreasing order. If during this check the difference is positive, that suggests that the reversed segment isn't properly decreasing, so the entire array can't be fixed by reversing a single segment. Hence, isTrue becomes true, and the output would be 0 0.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to replicate this logic.\n\nNow, handling loops and breaks. Java's labeled break can be a bit tricky in Fortran. Since the loop is breaking out of the entire loop when isTrue is set, perhaps we can use an exit statement with a condition.\n\nLet's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read len from input.\n2. Allocate array a with len elements.\n3. Read the array elements.\n4. Initialize l and r to 0, flags to .false., isTrue to .false.\n5. Loop over i from 1 to len (since Fortran is 1-based, whereas Java is 0-based). Wait, Java's loop is for (int i=0; i < len; i++), which is 0 to len-1. But the array elements in Java are compared to i+1. For example, a[i] != i+1. So in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based, the equivalent would be a(i) != i. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn Java, when i is 0, they check a[0] != 1. In Fortran, the first element is a(1), which should be 1. So in Fortran's loop, i runs from 1 to len. So the check is a(i) != i.\n\nSo during the loop, for each i from 1 to len:\n\nIf a(i) is not equal to i, and flag is false, then set l = i (since in Java it was i+1, but since i here is 1-based, the same as the Java's i+1). Then set flag to true, and continue.\n\nWait, Java's i starts at 0. So in their code, when i is 0, they check if a[0] != 1. In Fortran, i is 1, checking a(1) != 1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, if a(i) != i and flag is true, set r = i. Then check if a(r) - a(r-1) > 0. Wait, in Java, the code checks a[r-1] - a[r-2]. Because r is set to i+1 in Java, so when r is set, i is the current index, which is in 0-based. For example, if i is 5 (Java), then r is 6, and a[r-1] is a[5], a[r-2] is a[4]. So the difference is a[5] - a[4]. If this difference is positive, that implies that a[5] > a[4], which would be an issue if the segment is supposed to be reversed. Because in the reversed segment, the elements should be decreasing. So if the current element (a[i] in Java) is part of the reversed segment, then after reversing, the elements should be increasing. Wait, perhaps I need to think again.\n\nSuppose the original array has a segment from l to r which is reversed. For example, if the correct order is 1,2,3,4,5 but the array is 1,4,3,2,5. Then the reversed segment is 4,3,2. When you reverse that, you get 2,3,4. So the code checks that the reversed segment is a strictly decreasing sequence. If during the loop, within the reversed segment, any adjacent elements are increasing, then the code marks it as invalid.\n\nSo in Java's code, after finding l and r, they check if a[r-1] (which is the first element of the reversed segment in the array) minus a[r-2] (the next element) is positive. Wait, perhaps that's a typo. Because r is the end of the reversed segment. Let's think: For example, if l=2 and r=4 (indices in Java code), then the reversed segment is a[1] to a[3]. The code checks a[r-1] - a[r-2], which is a[3] - a[2]. If that's positive, then a[3] > a[2], which in the original array (before reversing) would be part of the reversed segment. So if the reversed segment is supposed to be in reverse order (i.e., 4,3,2), then the original array's segment would be 2,3,4. Then when reversed, it's correct. Wait, maybe the logic here is to check if the reversed segment is indeed strictly decreasing. So in the original array, the segment from l to r (Java's indices) must be a decreasing sequence, so when reversed, it becomes increasing.\n\nSo in Java's code, when they find a discrepancy (a[i] != i+1), they set l and then r. Then, once r is set, they check if the current element (a[r-1]) is greater than the previous (a[r-2]). If so, then the segment isn't a decreasing sequence, hence reversing it won't fix the array. So the code sets isTrue to true, meaning that the answer is 0 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, after setting r to i, check if a(r) - a(r-1) > 0. Because in Fortran, the array is 1-based. So when r is set to i, the current element is a(i). The previous element is a(i-1). So the difference would be a(i) - a(i-1). If that's positive, then it's a problem.\n\nWait, in Java code: when r is set to i+1. Let's take an example. Suppose in Java, i is 3 (0-based). Then r is set to 4. Then the check is a[4-1] - a[4-2] = a[3] - a[2]. So in Fortran, when r is set to i (which would be 4 in 1-based), the elements would be a(4) and a(3). So the difference is a(4) - a(3). So in Fortran, the check is (a(r) - a(r-1)) > 0. So if that's the case, then isTrue is set to true.\n\nSo during the loop:\n\nFor each i in 1..len:\n\nIf a(i) is not equal to i, then:\n\n- if flag is false: set l = i, flag = true.\n\n- else: set r = i. Then check if a(r) - a(r-1) > 0. If yes, set isTrue = true and exit the loop.\n\nWait, but in Java, the check is done when the second discrepancy is found. So once r is set (to i+1 in Java, which is i in Fortran), then check if a[r-1] - a[r-2] >0. So for Fortran, r is i, and a(r-1) would be a(i-1), a(r-2) would be a(i-2). Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here.\n\nWait, Java code:\n\nWhen the code sets r = i+1 (Java's i is the current index), then checks a[r-1] - a[r-2]. So r-1 is (i+1 -1) = i. a[i] is the current element, and a[r-2] is (i+1 -2) = i-1. So a[i] - a[i-1] >0.\n\nSo in Fortran, when i is the current index (1-based), setting r = i. Then, the elements to check are a(i) and a(i-1). So the difference is a(i) - a(i-1) >0. So the condition is the same.\n\nSo in Fortran, once r is set to i (the current index), check if a(r) - a(r-1) >0. If yes, set isTrue to .true. and exit the loop.\n\nBut how to handle the loop breaking? In Java, there's a labeled break that exits the entire loop. In Fortran, once isTrue is set, we can exit the loop. So perhaps after setting isTrue, we can exit the loop.\n\nSo the Fortran loop structure would be:\n\ndo i = 1, len\n\n   if (a(i) /= i) then\n\n      if (.not. flag) then\n\n          l = i\n\n          flag = .true.\n\n      else\n\n          r = i\n\n          if (a(r) - a(r-1) > 0) then\n\n              isTrue = .true.\n\n              exit\n\n          end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, after setting l, they continue to the next iteration (using continue). So in Fortran, after setting l and flag, the loop should proceed to the next i.\n\nAlso, the check for r occurs when flag is true. So in Fortran, after the first discrepancy (a(i) /= i), flag is set to true, and then subsequent discrepancies are processed as else.\n\nBut in Java, the code checks for a[i] != i+1 and !flag. So in Fortran, the equivalent is a(i) /= i and .not. flag.\n\nSo the loop would be:\n\ndo i = 1, len\n\n   if (a(i) /= i) then\n\n      if (.not. flag) then\n\n          l = i\n\n          flag = .true.\n\n      else\n\n          r = i\n\n          ! Check if the current element is greater than the previous\n\n          if (a(r) > a(r-1)) then\n\n              isTrue = .true.\n\n              exit\n\n          end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut wait, after setting r, the code checks if a(r) - a(r-1) >0. So if it's positive, meaning a(r) > a(r-1), then isTrue is set to true. Which implies that the reversed segment is not in strictly decreasing order. Hence, the entire array can't be fixed by reversing this segment, so the answer is 0 0.\n\nOnce isTrue is true, we break out of the loop.\n\nBut also, in Java's code, after the loop, they check if isTrue is false, then output l and r. Otherwise, 0 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the loop, if isTrue is .false., output l and r, else 0 0.\n\nNow, edge cases: what if l and r are 0? For example, if the array is already correct. Then the code would have l and r as 0, and the output would be 0 0.\n\nWait, let's think. If the array is already correct, then during the loop, no a(i) /= i would be found. So flag remains false. So l and r are 0. Then, after the loop, isTrue is still false. So the code would output l and r (0 0), which is correct. Because the array is already correct, so reversing a segment (none needed) would require outputting 0 0.\n\nBut wait, in Java code, the output is (!isTrue) ? l + \" \" + r : \"0 0\". So if isTrue is false, then output l and r, else 0 0. But in the case where the array is correct, l and r are 0. So output 0 0.\n\nWait, no. If the array is correct, then during the loop, l and r remain 0, and isTrue is false. So the ternary would output l and r (0 0), which is the same as the other case. So in that scenario, even if the array is correct, the output is 0 0, which is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code after the loop would check if isTrue is .false., and l and r would be 0. So output 0 0.\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine the Java code's logic.\n\nThe code sets l and r only if discrepancies are found. So if the array is correct, then l and r remain 0. Then, the ternary condition is !isTrue (which is true), so output l and r, which are 0 and 0. So the output is 0 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut if the array has a correct reversed segment (i.e., after reversing it, the array is sorted), then l and r would be set to the start and end of that segment, and isTrue would be false. So output l and r.\n\nBut if during the loop, any part of the reversed segment has a(r) - a(r-1) positive (i.e., elements are increasing), then isTrue is true, and output 0 0.\n\nSo the Fortran code's output is: if isTrue is .false. then write l and r, else 0 0.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nOther things to consider:\n\n- Fortran's array indices start at 1.\n\n- The array is declared with len elements. So in Fortran, the code will need to read len, then read the array elements.\n\nPotential code outline:\n\nprogram codeforces_56_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: len, i\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n    integer :: l = 0, r = 0\n    logical :: flag = .false., isTrue = .false.\n    \n    ! Read input\n    read *, len\n    allocate(a(len))\n    do i = 1, len\n        read *, a(i)\n    end do\n    \n    ! Process the array\n    do i = 1, len\n        if (a(i) /= i) then\n            if (.not. flag) then\n                l = i\n                flag = .true.\n            else\n                r = i\n                if (a(r) > a(r-1)) then\n                    isTrue = .true.\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n    \n    ! Determine output\n    if (.not. isTrue) then\n        print *, l, r\n    else\n        print *, '0 0'\n    end if\n    \nend program codeforces_56_B\n\nWait, but what if the reversed segment is only one element? For example, len=1, a(1)=2. Then during the loop, a(1) /= 1. So l is set to 1. Then, since there's no other elements, the loop ends. isTrue is .false., so output 1 0? Because r is 0. Hmm, but in Java code, l and r are initialized to 0. So in this case, r remains 0. Then, the output would be 1 0. But according to the problem statement, the segment to reverse must be a contiguous segment. If only l is set and r is 0, then how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps there's an error in the code's logic. Let's look at the Java code again.\n\nIn Java, after setting l, the code continues. Then, if another a[i] != i+1 is found, r is set. So in the case where only one element is wrong (like in the array [2, 1], len is 2), then l would be set to 1 (Java's i+1 is 1), then when i=1 (Java's i=1), a[1] is 1, which is correct. So no setting of r. So l is 1, r is 0. Then, the output would be 1 0. But the correct answer should be 1 1 (reverse the first element only). Wait, but that's impossible, because reversing a single element doesn't change anything. So in reality, such a case would require the array to be invalid.\n\nBut the Java code's logic may have a flaw here. However, since the task is to translate the code as is, perhaps I should proceed.\n\nIn the case where l is set, but r remains 0 (or, in Fortran's terms, 0?), then in the Java code, the output is l and r. But perhaps the original code checks if r is 0 and adjusts accordingly. Wait, looking at the Java code:\n\nThe variables l and r are initialized to 0. The loop sets l to i+1 when the first discrepancy is found, and r to i+1 for subsequent discrepancies. But if after the first discrepancy, no other discrepancies are found, then r remains 0.\n\nIn Java, after the loop, if isTrue is false, then output l and r. So in the case where only l is set and r is 0, the output would be l and r (like 1 0). But according to the problem statement, this is invalid. So the correct output in such a case should be 0 0.\n\nWait, but this suggests that the Java code may have a logic error. However, since the user wants a direct translation, perhaps we should proceed.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code would output l and r, which could be 1 and 0. Which would be incorrect. But that's a problem with the original code.\n\nBut perhaps the original code has a check after the loop to see if the reversed segment is valid. Let me look again.\n\nIn Java, after the loop, the code outputs l and r only if isTrue is false. But in the case where l is set and r is 0, then isTrue is false, and the output is l and r (0 and 0? Or in Java, since l and r are initialized to 0, and in this case, l is set to some value but r remains 0).\n\nWait, in the Java code, l and r are initialized to 0. So if during the loop, l is set to, say, 1, but no r is set (because there are no other discrepancies), then after the loop, isTrue is false, and the code would output l (1) and r (0). Which is 1 0. But according to the problem statement, this would be invalid. So the code is flawed.\n\nBut the problem may be that the code is intended to find a contiguous segment to reverse. So if there is only one element that is incorrect, then the code outputs 1 0, which is incorrect. However, the original Java code may have this flaw, but the translation must replicate it.\n\nSo the Fortran code would have the same behavior.\n\nBut perhaps the original code's logic is that after finding l, it expects to find r, and if not found, then perhaps r is l. But in the Java code, that's not the case. So the code's output could be invalid for some cases. But that's part of the original code's logic, and the Fortran code should replicate it.\n\nNow, let's test the code with sample inputs.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1 4 3 2\n\nIn Java, len is 4.\n\nThe array is [1,4,3,2].\n\nIn Java, the loop:\n\ni=0: a[0] =1 == 1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: a[1]=4 != 2 \u2192 set l=2. flag=true.\n\ni=2: a[2]=3 !=3 \u2192 flag is true. set r=3. check a[2] (since r=3, a[3-1]=a[2]=3, a[3-2]=a[1]=4. 3-4= -1 <0. So isTrue remains false.\n\ni=3: a[3] =2 !=4 \u2192 flag is true. set r=4. check a[4-1] =a[3]=2, a[4-2]=a[2]=3. 2-3= -1 <0. So no problem.\n\nAfter loop, isTrue is false. Output l=2, r=4. Which is correct: reversing elements 2-4 (4,3,2) becomes 2,3,4. So the array becomes 1 2 3 4.\n\nIn Fortran code, the array would be 1-based. So input array is [1,4,3,2]. For i=2 (Fortran's 2), a(2) =4 which is not equal to 2. So l=2. Then i=3: a(3)=3 !=3? No. So no. i=4: a(4)=2 !=4. So since flag is true, set r=4. Check a(4) -a(3) =2-3= -1 <0. So isTrue remains false. So output 2 4. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input array is already correct.\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 4 5.\n\nJava code: no discrepancies. l and r remain 0. isTrue is false. Output 0 0.\n\nFortran code: same.\n\nAnother test case where the reversed segment has an increasing pair.\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\n1 5 3 4 2.\n\nJava code:\n\nThe array is [1,5,3,4,2].\n\nLooking for discrepancies.\n\ni=0: 1 correct.\n\ni=1: 5 !=2 \u2192 l=2.\n\ni=2:3 !=3 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3:4 !=4 \u2192 no.\n\ni=4:2 !=5 \u2192 r=5. Check a[5-1] -a[5-2] =a[4] -a[3] =2-4 =-2 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, but the reversed segment is from l=2 to r=5. Which is elements 5,3,4,2. Reversing them would be 2,4,3,5. But the array after reversing would be 1,2,4,3,5. Which is not correct. So the code's logic may not catch this. Let's see:\n\nIn the Java code, during the loop, after setting l=2 (i=1 in Java), then when i=4 (Java's i=4), a[i] is 2 !=5, so r=5 (i+1=5). Then, check a[5-1] -a[5-2] \u2192 a[4] -a[3] =2-4= -2 <0. So isTrue is false. So output l=2 and r=5. But reversing the segment from 2 to 5 would give [5,3,4,2] \u2192 [2,4,3,5]. The array becomes [1,2,4,3,5], which is not correct. So the code's logic is flawed here. However, this is a problem with the original Java code, not the translation.\n\nSo the Fortran code replicates this logic.\n\nIn any case, the task is to translate the code as is.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be as outlined above.\n\nAnother point to note: the Java code prints l and r as space-separated integers, or 0 0. So in Fortran, the print statement should print the numbers with a space. Using print *, l, r would automatically add spaces between them. So for example, if l is 2 and r is 4, the output is \"2 4\".\n\nBut in Fortran, if the variables are integers, using list-directed output (print *, ...) will separate them with a space. So that's correct.\n\nAlso, in the case where l and r are zero, and isTrue is false, the output is 0 0. But in Fortran, when l and r are zero, that's exactly what is printed.\n\nNow, potential mistakes:\n\n- Forgetting to handle the 1-based vs 0-based indices.\n\n- Incorrectly translating the a[r-1] -a[r-2] part.\n\n- Forgetting to exit the loop when isTrue is set.\n\n- Initializing variables correctly.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, variables are initialized to certain values. For example, l and r are set to 0 at the start. So the code should be okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: when r is set, the code checks a(r) -a(r-1) >0. But if r is 1 (the first element), then r-1 is 0, which is out of bounds. But in the code's logic, r is only set when there is a discrepancy, and after l is set. So l must be set first, then r can be set. So l is set to some i >=1, then r is set to a higher index. Because once flag is true, the next discrepancies set r. So r will be greater than l. Because the loop is processing elements in order. For example, l is set to i=2 (Fortran index), then r can be i=3,4, etc. So when r is set, r is at least l+1, so r-1 is >= l >=1. So a(r-1) is valid.\n\nThus, no array out of bounds.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
