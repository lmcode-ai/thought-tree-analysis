So the sum ans is the sum of all dp[N, s], which is already modulo MOD. So no need to mod again. But to be safe, since the sum could be up to 4*1e9+7, perhaps mod again. But in Fortran, integers are 32-bit by default, which can handle up to 2e9. So for MOD=1e9+7, adding 64 terms each up to 1e9+7 could sum up to 6.4e10, which exceeds 32-bit integer (max 2e9). So need to use 64-bit integers. Ah, important point. So the variables should be declared as integer(kind=8) to handle large numbers. Thus, in Fortran:\n\ninteger(kind=8), parameter :: MOD = 10**9+7\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: N\n\ninteger(kind=8), allocatable :: dp(:,:)",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The problem seems to be about counting the number of valid strings of length N using the characters A, C, G, T, such that no substring contains \"AGC\" and also considering some swaps. The approach uses memoization with a dynamic programming approach, tracking the last three characters to check validity when adding a new character.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure. The Java code uses a class with a memo array of maps. The memoization stores for each position (current) and the last three characters (last3) the number of valid ways. The isOK function checks if adding a new character would create any forbidden patterns, including checking for adjacent swaps that could form AGC when a new character is added.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Fortran doesn't have built-in hash maps, so for memoization, we need a different approach. Since the last3 can be a string of three characters (each being A, C, G, T), there are 4^3 = 64 possible combinations. So, we can represent each possible combination as an integer index. For example, each character can be mapped to 0-3, and the three-character string becomes a 3-digit base-4 number, which is 0-63. This way, memo can be a 2D array: memo(N+1, 64), where each entry holds the count for that state.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Convert the last3 string into an integer index. For example, \"TTT\" would be 3,3,3 \u2192 3*4^2 +3*4 +3 = 63.\n\n2. Precompute all possible transitions. For each current state (last3) and each possible new character, check if the combination (last3 + new_char) forms a forbidden pattern. If allowed, then the new last3 becomes (last3[1:3] + new_char).\n\n3. Use dynamic programming with memoization as a 2D array.\n\nNow, in Java, the memo is a list of maps. But in Fortran, we'll use a 2D array where the first dimension is the current position (from 0 to N) and the second is the state (0-63). The initial state is \"TTT\", which is 63. The base case is when current == N, return 1.\n\nLet's outline the functions:\n\n- The main function will read N, initialize the DP table, and compute the result using recursion or iteration. However, recursion in Fortran might be tricky, especially for large N (since the Java code uses N up to, say, 1e5, but here the original code uses N from input, but for the problem constraints, maybe N is up to 100 or similar). Wait, the problem is from atcoder's ABC122 D, which has N up to 100. So recursion with memoization might not be feasible in Fortran due to stack limits. So, better to use iterative DP.\n\nAh, right! The original Java code uses a recursive approach with memoization, but for Fortran, especially with larger N, an iterative approach using dynamic programming would be more efficient and avoid stack overflow.\n\nSo, converting the recursive DFS into an iterative DP. Let's think:\n\nWe can create a DP table where dp[i][s] represents the number of valid strings of length i ending with state s (the last three characters). The transitions are as follows: for each state s (last three chars), adding a new character c, check if the new last four characters (the three from s plus c) are valid. If so, the new state becomes (s[1], s[2], c), and we add dp[i][s] to dp[i+1][new_s].\n\nWait, but the state in the Java code is the last three characters. So, the iterative DP would start from i=0 (current 0 in the code, which is the initial state of \"TTT\"). Wait, in the Java code, the initial call is dfs(0, \"TTT\"). So the first character added is for current=0, but the code counts up to current=N. So, perhaps the DP is for i steps, starting from 0, up to N steps. Each step adds a new character. So the total length of the string is N, built step by step.\n\nWait, in the Java code, current starts at 0, and when current == N, returns 1. So for each current, we add a new character, and when current reaches N, that's the base case. So the process is building the string step by step up to N characters.\n\nSo, for iterative DP:\n\nInitialize the DP table. dp[0][state] = 0 for all states except the initial state (\"TTT\", which is state 63) which is 1.\n\nThen, for each step from 0 to N-1:\n\nFor each state s in possible states (0-63):\n\n   if dp[i][s] is 0, skip.\n\n   for each possible character c (A, C, G, T):\n\n       form the new string last3 + c (i.e., the last three characters of s, plus c, forming a 4-character string).\n\n       check if this new string is invalid (contains AGC, or any of the swaps would create AGC). If it's valid, then compute the new state s' which is (s's last two characters) followed by c.\n\n       add dp[i][s] to dp[i+1][s'] modulo MOD.\n\nFinally, the answer is the sum of dp[N][s] for all possible s.\n\nWait, no. Because when current is N, we return 1. So, in the iterative approach, dp[N][s] is 1 for all s that are valid. Wait, no. The base case in the Java code is when current == N, return 1. So, the initial condition is that when we have built all N characters (current == N), there's 1 way. So in the DP approach, the initial condition is dp[N][s] =1 for any s? No. Wait, the Java code's base case is current == N, regardless of the last3, returns 1. But in reality, the last3 is irrelevant once we've built all N characters. So, the total number of valid strings is the sum over all possible states s of dp[N][s], but in the code, the base case returns 1, which implies that once all N characters are added, it's counted as 1. So, in the iterative approach, the DP would start with current=0 (zero characters added), and when current reaches N, that's considered a valid count.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express the Java code:\n\nThe function dfs(current, last3) returns the number of valid strings of length (N - current), given that the last three characters are last3.\n\nWait, no. Because when current is 0, we need to build N characters. Each step adds a character. So current increments from 0 to N, and when current == N, we've added all N characters, hence return 1.\n\nSo the total number of valid strings is dfs(0, \"TTT\").\n\nThus, the DP[i][s] represents the number of valid ways to build the remaining (N - i) characters, given that the last three characters are s.\n\nBut for iterative DP, it's easier to model it as building the string step by step. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: The state is the current position (i) and the last three characters. At each step i, we decide what character to add next, check if the last four (the previous three plus the new one) are allowed. If yes, then the new state is the new last three characters (the previous three's last two, plus the new character).\n\nSo, for i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   for each possible state s (last3):\n\n      for each possible character c:\n\n          check if s + c is allowed.\n\n          if allowed, then the new state is (s[1:3] + c).\n\n          dp[i+1][new_s] += dp[i][s]\n\nMOD 1e9+7.\n\nThe initial state is i=0 with s=TTT, which is represented as the state 63. dp[0][63] = 1.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to N-1, compute transitions.\n\nFinally, the answer is the sum of dp[N][s] for all s.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when current reaches N, it returns 1. So in the DP, when i=N, the value is 1 for all possible s. Because once you've added N characters, you have a valid string (assuming all previous steps were valid). But the validity checks are done during the transitions, so when i reaches N, the state doesn't matter anymore; it's already counted as valid.\n\nWait, no. The Java code's base case is when current == N, returns 1. So regardless of the state (last3), once we reach the end (current == N), it's counted as one valid way. So in the DP, dp[N][s] is 1 for any s. But that's not correct, because the problem is about strings of length N. So perhaps the way the DP is structured is that for i steps (each step adds a character), starting from 0, and building up to N steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the Java code's approach is that current is the number of characters added so far. So when current is 0, zero characters added. When current is N, all N characters are added, and thus returns 1. The transitions are adding a character, incrementing current by 1 each time.\n\nSo in the iterative approach, the DP array would have dimensions [0..N][0..63], where dp[i][s] is the number of valid ways to add i characters such that the last three are s. But when i=0, how can there be three characters? The initial state in the Java code is \"TTT\", which perhaps is a placeholder. So the initial state is i=0, with the last three being \"TTT\". Then, for each i from 0 to N-1, we add a new character, and compute the next state. Then, when i reaches N, the total is the sum of all possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is \"TTT\", which is the last three characters before adding any. Then, each step adds a character, which is the fourth character in the sequence. The first character added is the fourth in the initial \"TTT\", but since it's the first step, perhaps it's part of the initial state.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let's think of the state as the last three characters. To add the next character, the new four characters (previous three + new) must be checked. So the initial state is \"TTT\" (i=0). Then, when we add the first character, it becomes the fourth character, but the new state is the last three of the four (the last two of \"TTT\" plus the new character). So the initial state is for zero characters added, but the first step adds the first character, leading to a state of three characters (the last three of \"TTT\" + c). Wait, no. The initial state is \"TTT\" when current is 0. Then, when adding the first character (current=0), the code checks if \"TTT\" + c is allowed. If yes, then the new state (current+1=1) is \"TTT\".substring(1) + c \u2192 which is \"TT\" + c \u2192 the new last3 is \"TTC\" if c is C. Then, this becomes the state for current=1.\n\nSo, each step adds a character, and the state is the last three characters. The initial state is \"TTT\" (current=0). Then, for each current from 0 to N-1, we add a character and transition to current+1 with the new state. When current reaches N, we return 1.\n\nTherefore, the iterative DP approach would model this as follows:\n\nInitialize dp[0][s_initial] = 1, where s_initial is the code for \"TTT\" (63).\n\nFor each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   for each state s in 0..63:\n\n       if dp[i][s] == 0, skip.\n\n       for each possible character c (0-3):\n\n           last3 is s's corresponding string.\n\n           new_last4 = last3 + c's character.\n\n           Check if new_last4 is valid (using isOK function).\n\n           if valid:\n\n               new_s = (last3's last two characters) + c \u2192 which is s shifted left by one character, and the new character appended.\n\n               new_s_code = (s % 16) *4 + c_code.\n\n               dp[i+1][new_s_code] += dp[i][s]\n\n               mod 1e9+7.\n\nAt the end, sum all dp[N][s] for s in 0..63.\n\nWait, but when i reaches N, the total number of ways is the sum of all possible states at step N. But in the Java code, when current == N, it returns 1, regardless of the state. So, the base case is that once all N steps are done, it's counted as 1, so the sum of all possible ways after N steps is the total.\n\nBut according to the Java code's structure, the dfs returns 1 when current == N. So each path that reaches current == N contributes 1, regardless of the state. Thus, in the iterative approach, each step's count is carried forward, and when i reaches N, each path contributes 1. Therefore, the total is the sum of all dp[N][s] ?\n\nWait, no. Because in the Java code, when current == N, the function returns 1, which implies that each path that reaches current == N (regardless of the state) counts as 1. So the total number of valid paths is the number of ways to reach current == N with any state. Hence, the total is the sum of dp[N][s] for all s.\n\nBut in the iterative DP approach, the dp[i][s] represents the number of ways to reach state s after i steps. Then, when i=N, each of those states contributes 1. So the answer is the sum of dp[N][s] for all s.\n\nBut according to the Java code's base case, when current == N, the function returns 1. So in the recursive approach, the count for each path is multiplied by 1 at the end. So the total is the sum over all paths that reach current == N. Hence, the answer is the sum of all dp[N][s].\n\nBut in the initial state, dp[0][63] =1. Then, for each step, transitions are made, and finally, after N steps, the sum of all dp[N][s] is the answer.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, the key steps:\n\n1. Represent the state as a number (0-63) based on the three characters.\n\n2. Precompute the mapping between 3-character strings and their code.\n\n3. Implement the isOK function for a 4-character string.\n\n4. Implement the iterative DP.\n\nNow, let's think about how to encode the state.\n\nEach character can be represented as 0,1,2,3 (A, C, G, T). So for example, A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3.\n\nA three-character string like \"ACG\" would be 0*4^2 +1*4 +2= 0*16 +1*4 +2= 6.\n\nSo the code for a three-character string can be computed as follows:\n\ncode = c1 * 16 + c2 *4 + c3.\n\nBut for the state, when adding a new character c, the new state is (c2, c3, c).\n\nSo, for example, if the current state is code = (c1, c2, c3), then adding a new character c4 would transition to (c2, c3, c4), which is code_new = c2*16 + c3 *4 + c4.\n\nSo, given a state s (code), the next state when adding a character c is ( (s mod 16) *4 + c ) // 4? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\ns = c1*16 + c2*4 + c3.\n\nTo get the next state after adding c4:\n\nnew_c1 = c2\n\nnew_c2 = c3\n\nnew_c3 = c4\n\nso new_code = c2 *16 + c3*4 + c4.\n\nWhich can be calculated as:\n\ns = 16*c1 +4*c2 +c3.\n\ns mod 16: 4*c2 + c3 \u2192 this is (c2 and c3 parts).\n\nMultiply by 4: 4*(4*c2 + c3) = 16*c2 +4*c3. Then add c4.\n\nBut 16*c2 +4*c3 + c4 = 4*(4*c2 + c3) + c4 \u2192 which is 4*( (s mod 16) ) + c4.\n\nSo, the new code is ( (s mod 16) ) *4 + c4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for a current state s and new character c (0-3), the new state is ( (s mod 16) ) *4 + c.\n\nThat's how the state transitions.\n\nNow, the isOK function needs to check if the last four characters (the three from the state plus the new character) form a forbidden pattern. The forbidden patterns are:\n\n- Any permutation of A, G, C such that the four-character string contains \"AGC\" or any swap of adjacent characters that would create \"AGC\".\n\nIn the Java code, the isOK function checks:\n\n1. If the new four-character string contains \"AGC\".\n\n2. For each i from 0 to 2, swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters and check if the result contains \"AGC\".\n\nSo, for example, if the four characters are \"AGxC\", swapping the first two (positions 0 and 1) gives \"GAxC\", but if the original was \"A G x C\", swapping positions 1 and 2 would create \"AxGC\", which may not be the case. Wait, the code in Java checks all possible adjacent swaps in the four-character string. For example, the four-character string is last3 + c. So for i=0, swap 0 and 1; i=1, swap 1 and 2; i=2, swap 2 and 3. Then check if any of those swaps result in \"AGC\".\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the Java code:\n\nThe code creates a char array of the four characters (last3 + c), then for each i from 0 to 2 (the first three positions), it swaps i and i+1, creates a new string, and checks if any of those swapped strings contains \"AGC\".\n\nSo, for the original four characters, it checks not only the original string but all possible single adjacent swaps in the four-character string. If any of those swaps (including the original) contains \"AGC\", then the new character is invalid.\n\nSo, the isOK function returns false if any of the following is true:\n\n- The original string contains \"AGC\".\n\n- After swapping any adjacent pair (positions 0-1, 1-2, or 2-3), the resulting string contains \"AGC\".\n\nSo, for a four-character string s, we need to check:\n\ns contains \"AGC\" OR any of the three possible swaps (positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3) in s leads to a string that contains \"AGC\".\n\nIn Fortran, to check this, given the four-character string (as characters A, C, G, T), we can generate all possible swapped versions and check.\n\nBut since the four-character string is being passed, we need to generate all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, for the given four characters (c1, c2, c3, c4):\n\nCheck if any of the following is a substring \"AGC\":\n\n- original: c1, c2, c3, c4.\n\n- swapped positions 0 and 1: c2, c1, c3, c4.\n\n- swapped positions 1 and 2: c1, c3, c2, c4.\n\n- swapped positions 2 and 3: c1, c2, c4, c3.\n\nIf any of these four strings contains \"AGC\" as a substring, then it's invalid.\n\nSo for each four-character string, we need to generate these four possibilities and check.\n\nBut generating all four possibilities for each check might be time-consuming, but since the string is four characters long, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, check for the presence of \"AGC\" in the original string and in the three swapped possibilities.\n\nAnother approach is to generate all possible four-character sequences that are invalid. For example, all four-char sequences that have \"AGC\" in any position (positions 0-2, as it's a three-character substring) in the original or after any single adjacent swap.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible four-character sequence, check:\n\nDoes the original have \"AGC\" in positions 0-2, 1-3?\n\nWait, \"AGC\" is a three-character sequence, so in a four-character string, possible starting positions are 0, 1. So check if any of the substrings starting at 0 or 1 is \"AGC\".\n\nFor the swapped versions, similarly.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to generate all possible swapped versions and check each for \"AGC\".\n\nBut how to represent the four characters?\n\nIn the Fortran code, the four characters can be represented as an array of four integers (0-3). Then, for each of the four possibilities (original, swap 0-1, swap 1-2, swap 2-3), generate the corresponding array and check if any of them contains \"AGC\" as a substring.\n\nFor example, the original is [c1, c2, c3, c4].\n\nSwap 0-1: [c2, c1, c3, c4]. Check if any of the first three characters form AGC (positions 0-2) or positions 1-3.\n\nWait, \"AGC\" is three characters. So in a four-character array, the possible substrings are:\n\npositions 0-2: [0,1,2]\n\npositions 1-3: [1,2,3]\n\nSo for each of the four possibilities (original and three swaps), check if either of these two substrings is \"AGC\" (0,1,2).\n\nSo for each four-character array, check:\n\nFor the two possible substrings (positions 0-2 and 1-3):\n\nCheck if the substring is 0, 1, 2 (A, C, G).\n\nIf any of the four possibilities (original or three swaps) have any of the two substrings equal to 0,1,2, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the steps for isOK:\n\nGiven the four characters c1, c2, c3, c4:\n\nCheck if any of the following four arrays (original and swaps) have a substring 0-2 equal to (0,1,2) or 1-3 equal to (0,1,2):\n\n1. [c1, c2, c3, c4]\n\n   check (c1, c2, c3) == (0,1,2) \u2192 \"AGC\"\n\n   check (c2, c3, c4) == (0,1,2)\n\n2. [c2, c1, c3, c4]\n\n   check (c2, c1, c3) == (0,1,2)\n\n   check (c1, c3, c4) == (0,1,2)\n\n3. [c1, c3, c2, c4]\n\n   check (c1, c3, c2) == (0,1,2)\n\n   check (c3, c2, c4) == (0,1,2)\n\n4. [c1, c2, c4, c3]\n\n   check (c1, c2, c4) == (0,1,2)\n\n   check (c2, c4, c3) == (0,1,2)\n\nIf any of these eight checks (four arrays, two checks each) is true, then return false (invalid). Otherwise, return true.\n\nSo in code, for each four-character array, generate the four possible swapped versions, and for each of those, check the two possible three-character substrings.\n\nBut this is a bit tedious, but manageable.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, map the characters to numbers: A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3.\n\nThe state is a three-character code, represented as a number between 0 and 63.\n\nThe DP array is of size (0:N, 0:63), initialized to 0, with dp(0, 63) =1 (since \"TTT\" is 3,3,3 \u2192 3*16 +3*4 +3= 63).\n\nFor each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   For each state s in 0..63:\n\n      if dp(i, s) is 0, skip.\n\n      For each possible new character c (0-3):\n\n          Get the three characters of state s: c1, c2, c3.\n\n          Form the four-character array: [c1, c2, c3, c].\n\n          Check if this four-character array is valid (isOK).\n\n          If valid:\n\n              new_state = (s mod 16) *4 + c \u2192 which is c2*16 + c3*4 + c.\n\n              dp(i+1, new_state) = (dp(i+1, new_state) + dp(i, s)) mod MOD.\n\nAt the end, sum all dp(N, s) for s in 0..63.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nBut in Fortran, we need to implement the isOK function. Let's code that as a helper function.\n\nBut how to extract the four characters from the state and the new character.\n\nWait, for a given state s (three characters: c1, c2, c3), adding a new character c (0-3), the four characters are c1, c2, c3, c.\n\nBut how to get c1, c2, c3 from s?\n\ns is a number between 0 and 63. We can compute c1 = s / 16, c2 = (s mod 16) /4, c3 = s mod4.\n\nWait, yes. Because:\n\ns = c1*4^2 + c2*4 + c3.\n\nSo c1 = s / (4^2) \u2192 integer division.\n\nc2 = (s - c1*16)/4 \u2192 (s mod 16)/4.\n\nc3 = s mod 4.\n\nSo for example, s=63: 63/16=3 (since 3*16=48, 63-48=15. 15/4=3.75 \u2192 integer division gives 3. So c1=3, c2=3, c3=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nc1 = s / 16\n\nremainder = mod(s, 16)\n\nc2 = remainder /4\n\nc3 = mod(remainder,4)\n\nSo for s, the three characters are c1, c2, c3.\n\nThen, the four characters are c1, c2, c3, c.\n\nNow, the isOK function for these four characters:\n\nFunction is_valid(c1, c2, c3, c4) result(ok)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: c1, c2, c3, c4\n\nlogical :: ok\n\ninteger :: i, j\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: chars\n\nchars = [c1, c2, c3, c4]\n\nok = .true.\n\n!

Swap positions 1 and 2: c1, c3, c2, c4\n\nchars = [c1, c3, c2, c4]\n\ncall check_substrings(chars, ok)\n\nif (.not. ok) return\n\n!

Check substring 0-2 and 1-3\n\nif ( (chars(1) == 0 .and. chars(2) ==1 .and. chars(3) ==2) .or. &\n\n     (chars(2) ==0 .and. chars(3) ==1 .and. chars(4) ==2) ) then\n\n    ok = .false.\n\n    return\n\nendif\n\nend subroutine check_substrings\n\nend function is_valid\n\nWait, but in the four-character array, indexes are 1-based in Fortran. So for chars(1), chars(2), chars(3), chars(4).\n\nCheck if the first three (chars(1:3)) are (0,1,2) \u2192 \"AGC\".\n\nOr if chars(2:4) are (0,1,2).\n\nSo in the check_substrings routine, if either of these two conditions is true, then the string is invalid.\n\nSo the subroutine checks these two possibilities.\n\nThus, the is_valid function returns false if any of the four possible permutations (original or three swaps) has either of the two substrings equal to AGC (0,1,2).\n\nIf any of the four permutations has a substring AGC, then the function returns false.\n\nOtherwise, returns true.\n\nNow, the main code structure:\n\nRead N.\n\nInitialize MOD = 1e9+7.\n\nInitialize dp(0:N, 0:63) as 0.\n\ndp(0, 63) = 1.\n\nDo for each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   do s = 0 to 63:\n\n      if dp(i, s) == 0, cycle.\n\n      c1 = s / 16\n\n      remainder = mod(s, 16)\n\n      c2 = remainder /4\n\n      c3 = mod(remainder,4)\n\n      do c = 0 to 3:\n\n          ! four characters are c1, c2, c3, c.\n\n          valid = is_valid(c1, c2, c3, c)\n\n          if (valid) then:\n\n              new_state = (mod(s, 16)) *4 + c\n\n              dp(i+1, new_state) = mod(dp(i+1, new_state) + dp(i, s), MOD)\n\n          endif\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThen, sum all dp(N, s) for s in 0-63.\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is \"TTT\" (s=63) for i=0, which corresponds to zero characters added. Then, each step adds a character. When i reaches N, we have added N characters, and the sum is the total number of valid strings.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, Fortran code:\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic allocation is needed for arrays. Since N can be up to 100, the dp array can be dimensioned as (0:N, 0:63), which is manageable.\n\nBut Fortran's indexes start from 1 by default unless specified. So perhaps using 0-based indexes.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the code.\n\nBut in Fortran, you can declare:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MOD = 10**9+7\n\ninteger :: N\n\ninteger, allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n\nread *, N\n\nallocate(dp(0:N, 0:63))\n\ndp = 0\n\ndp(0, 63) = 1\n\ndo i = 0, N-1\n\n   do s = 0, 63\n\n      if (dp(i, s) == 0) cycle\n\n      c1 = s / 16\n\n      remainder = mod(s, 16)\n\n      c2 = remainder /4\n\n      c3 = mod(remainder,4)\n\n      do c = 0, 3\n\n          if (is_valid(c1, c2, c3, c)) then\n\n              new_s = mod(s, 16) *4 + c\n\n              dp(i+1, new_s) = mod(dp(i+1, new_s) + dp(i, s), MOD)\n\n          endif\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nans = sum(dp(N, :)) \n\nprint *, mod(ans, MOD)\n\nBut Fortran's sum might not handle integer overflow, but since we are modding at each step, the sum is already modded, so the final sum is modded again.\n\nWait, but in the code, each addition is done modulo MOD. So the sum ans is the sum of all dp[N, s], which is already modulo MOD. So no need to mod again.\n\nBut to be safe, since the sum could be up to 4*1e9+7, perhaps mod again.\n\nBut in Fortran, integers are 32-bit by default, which can handle up to 2e9. So for MOD=1e9+7, adding 64 terms each up to 1e9+7 could sum up to 6.4e10, which exceeds 32-bit integer (max 2e9). So need to use 64-bit integers.\n\nAh, important point. So the variables should be declared as integer(kind=8) to handle large numbers.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ninteger(kind=8), parameter :: MOD = 10**9+7\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: N\n\ninteger(kind=8), allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n\nSo, that way, each entry in dp is an 8-byte integer.\n\nAlso, when reading N, it's an integer(kind=8).\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nThe is_valid function is a logical function that takes four integers (c1, c2, c3, c4) and returns true if none of the four permutations contain AGC in the required positions.\n\nNow, the full code:\n\nmodule mymod\n\ncontains\n\n    logical function is_valid(c1, c2, c3, c4)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: c1, c2, c3, c4\n        integer(kind=8) :: chars(4), temp\n        integer :: i\n\n        !

However, in Fortran, the kind for integers in functions must match. So perhaps the function should be:\n\n    logical function is_valid(c1, c2, c3, c4)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: c1, c2, c3, c4\n        ...\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, the variables c1, c2, c3, c are derived from the state and the loop variable c, which are integer(kind=8).\n\nThis should be okay.\n\nBut I should also check for any possible errors in the code.\n\nFor example, when calculating new_s = mod(s, 16) *4 + c. mod(s, 16) is the remainder when s is divided by 16, which is 0-15. Multiplying by4 gives 0-60, adding c (0-3) gives 0-63.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial state, code 63 is TTT, which is correct.\n\nNow, the check_substrings function in the is_valid function checks if the first three characters are 0,1,2 (A, C, G) or the middle three (positions 2-4 in 1-based) are 0,1,2.\n\nWait, in the four-element array, the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. So the first three are positions 1-3, and the middle three are 2-4? No, the middle three would be positions 2-4, but the array is four elements. So the two substrings to check are positions 1-3 and 2-4.\n\nWait, in a four-element array:\n\nindices 1,2,3,4.\n\nsubstring 1-3: elements 1,2,3.\n\nsubstring 2-4: elements 2,3,4.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo in check_substrings:\n\nif ( (chars(1) ==0 .and. chars(2) ==1 .and. chars(3) ==2) \u2192 substring 1-3 is AGC.\n\nOR\n\n(chars(2) ==0 .and. chars(3) ==1 .and. chars(4) ==2) \u2192 substring 2-4 is AGC.\n\nSo this correctly checks both possible substrings.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nBut Fortran's array syntax is 1-based, so the code is correct.\n\nAnother potential issue: the function is_valid is part of the module, and the variables are properly declared.\n\nNow, testing this code with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nN=3\n\nExpected output: 61 (from the problem statement, perhaps?)\n\nBut in any case, the code should handle it.\n\nBut since this is a code translation, the key is to mirror the logic of the original Java code.\n\nThe original Java code uses memoization with recursion, but the Fortran code uses iterative DP with a 2D array. This should be equivalent.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
