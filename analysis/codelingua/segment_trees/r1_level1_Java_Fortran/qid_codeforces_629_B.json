Then, for each day, it checks the minimum of the two counts (M and F) and keeps track of the maximum such minimum. Finally, it outputs twice that maximum value.\n\nHmm, so the key points are:\n\n- Arrays FfriendPerDay and MfriendPerDay of size 367 (since days go up to 366).\n- For each person, loop from a to b and update the counts.\n- After each update on day j, check if the current day's min(M, F) is the new maximum. Then multiply the final maximum by 2.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in the Java code, days start at 1, I think. Wait, in Java, the arrays are 367 elements, indexes 0 to 366. But the input a and b are days, which can be 1 to 366. So when they use j from a to b, the Java arrays are being indexed correctly. So in Fortran, I need to have arrays from 1 to 366. Because Fortran's default lower bound is 1, so declaring FfriendPerDay(366) would cover days 1-366.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Java, the arrays are of size 367. Let's see: when a person's a is 1, j starts at 1, and the array is of size 367, which allows indexes 0-366. So days are 1-366. So in Fortran, if I create arrays of size 366, that's days 1-366, which matches. So in Fortran, declare FfriendPerDay(366) and MfriendPerDay(366).\n\nNow, the steps:\n\n1. Read 'n' from input.\n2. Initialize the two arrays to zero.\n3. For each of n entries, read the gender, a, b. Then loop from a to b, updating the counts. After each increment, check if the current day's min(M, F) is larger than the current answer, and update accordingly.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the Java code, after incrementing M or F for day j, they check if M[j] is less than F[j]. If so, then they take M[j] as the possible max. Otherwise, take F[j]. Then compare to the current answer and update if larger. So the answer is the maximum over all days of the minimum of M and F counts for that day.\n\nAh right. So the answer is the maximum, over all days, of the minimum between M and F counts. Then multiply by 2.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic.\n\nNow, translating variables:\n\n- n is read as integer.\n- FfriendPerDay and MfriendPerDay are integer arrays of size 366 (since days go 1-366).\n- answer starts at 0.\n- For each i from 1 to n:\n   Read the gender (char), a, b.\n   Loop j from a to b:\n      increment the respective array.\n      compute current_min = min(MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j))\n      if current_min > answer, set answer to current_min.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the Java code, after incrementing, they compare M and F for day j, then take the smaller of the two as a candidate for the maximum. So for each day j, after the increment, they check:\n\nif M[j] < F[j], then the candidate is M[j], else F[j]. Then compare this candidate to the current answer. If it's larger, update answer.\n\nSo in each iteration (for each day j in a to b, after incrementing), compute the minimum of M and F for j, then see if that's larger than the current maximum. If yes, update the answer.\n\nBut in Java code, during each increment (after updating the count), they check the current day's M and F. So for example, if you have a day j where M and F are 3 and 5, the min is 3, which is a candidate. So answer is the maximum of all those mins across all days.\n\nThen, the final answer is answer * 2.\n\nSo in Fortran, the same approach.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize FfriendPerDay and MfriendPerDay as arrays of size 366, all zeros.\n\nInitialize answer to 0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to n:\n\n   Read the gender, a, b.\n\n   Loop j from a to b:\n\n      if gender is 'M', increment MfriendPerDay(j).\n\n      else, increment FfriendPerDay(j).\n\n      current_min = min(MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j))\n\n      if current_min > answer, then answer = current_min\n\nEnd loops.\n\nFinally, print answer * 2.\n\nBut in Fortran, input is read differently. Let's think about how to read the input.\n\nIn the Java code, each line for a person is like 'M 1 5' or 'F 10 15'. So each person is given as a string (for the gender), followed by two integers.\n\nIn Fortran, when reading from the input, each line is read as a record. So for each person, we can read a line, split into the three components.\n\nBut in Fortran, the format for reading the input: the gender is a single character, then two integers.\n\nSo using formatted input: for each person, read a line with format (A1, 1X, I3, 1X, I3) or similar, but the exact format depends on how the input is given.\n\nBut perhaps using list-directed input (using * as the format) could work. But the problem is that in Fortran, when using list-directed input, the scanner skips over whitespace, so if the input line is 'M 1 365', then reading the three variables (gender as character, a and b as integers) would work.\n\nSo in Fortran code, perhaps:\n\ncharacter :: gender\n\ninteger :: a, b\n\nread(*, *) gender, a, b\n\nBut note that the gender is read as a single character. However, in Java, the code uses sc.next(), which reads the next token (so the entire word, but in the example, it's a single character 'M' or 'F'). So the input for each person is a line with 'M' followed by two integers, separated by spaces.\n\nThus, in Fortran, using list-directed input (read with format *) to read the gender (as a character) and a and b.\n\nBut when you read a character variable with list-directed input, it reads the next non-blank character. Wait, no. Wait, when you read a character variable with list-directed input, it reads the entire next token. For example, if the input is 'Male 1 2', then gender would be 'Male' but stored in a character variable. So if the variable is declared as character(len=1), then only the first character is stored, and the rest is truncated. But in the Java code, the input is a single character (M or F), so perhaps the input lines are such that gender is a single character.\n\nAssuming that the input is correct as in the Java code, then in Fortran, reading a character variable of length 1 would capture the 'M' or 'F' correctly.\n\nSo declare gender as character(len=1).\n\nSo code steps in Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, b, i, j, answer, current_min\n    character(len=1) :: gender\n    integer, dimension(366) :: FfriendPerDay = 0, MfriendPerDay = 0\n\n    read(*, *) n\n\n    answer = 0\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*, *) gender, a, b\n        do j = a, b\n            if (gender == 'M') then\n                MfriendPerDay(j) = MfriendPerDay(j) + 1\n            else\n                FfriendPerDay(j) = FfriendPerDay(j) + 1\n            end if\n            current_min = min(MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j))\n            if (current_min > answer) then\n                answer = current_min\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    print *, answer * 2\n\nend program main\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default. So when a day is 1, it's index 1 in the array. So the original code's day ranges are 1-based. So in Java, the code uses a and b as days, so the arrays are indexed from 1 to 366 (since 366 is the maximum possible day). So in Fortran, the arrays are 1-based, so the code correctly uses a and b as the indices.\n\nBut need to make sure that a and b are within 1 to 366. But the Java code assumes that, so the Fortran code does the same.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the arrays are of size 367, indexes 0-366. But in the code, when j ranges from a to b (e.g., a=1, b=366), the code uses j as the index, which is correct. So in Fortran, the arrays are 1 to 366, so j must be between 1 and 366.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nTesting with some input. Let's see.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\nM 1 5\n\nF 1 5\n\nM 3 7\n\nF 4 6\n\nSo for each day:\n\nDay 1: M=1, F=1 \u2192 min 1. answer becomes 1.\n\nDay 2: same as day 1.\n\nDay 3: M increments to 2 (from 1), F remains 1. min 1. answer stays 1.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nFirst person is M, days 1-5.\n\nSo after first iteration (i=1), MfriendPerDay(1-5) are 1 each. F remains 0. So for each day 1-5, min is 0 (since F is 0). So answer remains 0.\n\nThen second person is F, days 1-5. So FfriendPerDay(1-5) becomes 1 each. For each day j=1-5:\n\nM[j] and F[j] are both 1. min is 1. So answer becomes 1.\n\nThird person is M, days 3-7. So days 3-5: M increases to 2 each. Days 6-7: M becomes 1.\n\nFor days 3-5:\n\nM=2, F=1 \u2192 min is 1. answer is 1.\n\nSo no change.\n\nFor days 6-7:\n\nM=1, F=0 \u2192 min 0. No change.\n\nFourth person is F, days 4-6. So days 4-5: F becomes 2. day6: F becomes 1.\n\nDay4: M=2, F=2 \u2192 min 2. answer becomes 2.\n\nDay5: same as day4.\n\nDay6: M=1, F=1 \u2192 min 1.\n\nSo the maximum answer is 2. Output is 2*2=4.\n\nSo the Fortran code should output 4 for this input.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when a or b is 0? But according to the problem statement, probably the days are valid (1-366). So Fortran code doesn't check that. The original Java code also allows j up to 366, as in the array is size 367.\n\nWait, in Java code, the array is size 367. So indexes 0-366. But when a and b are read from input, they can be 0? For example, if a is 0, j would be 0 to b. Then MfriendPerDay[0] is incremented, etc. But according to the problem statement, perhaps the days are 1-based, so a and b are within 1-366. So in the Java code, perhaps the input ensures that a and b are valid. So Fortran code doesn't handle invalid days, but the problem probably doesn't test that.\n\nThus, the code should work."
