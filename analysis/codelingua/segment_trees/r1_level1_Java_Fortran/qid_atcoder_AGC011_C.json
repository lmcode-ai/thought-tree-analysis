The Java code's calculation is:\n\nlong total = one * (2 * n - one);\ntotal += (count - one) * (count - one);\ntotal += bipartite * bipartite;\n\nWhich is:\n\ntotal = one*(2n - one) + (count - one)^2 + bipartite^2; But in the Fortran code, (count_val - one) is the number of non-single components, which includes bipartite and non-bipartite. So (count_val - one)^2 would be the square of the sum of bipartite and non-bipartite components. But then adding bipartite^2 is part of it? That seems odd. But this is a direct translation of the Java code. But perhaps the Java code's variables:\n\ncount is the total components.",

So in the Fortran code, when kind_val is 1, we increment 'one'. Now, in the main loop:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n  if (visited(i)) cycle\n  count_val = count_val + 1\n  mujun = .false. kind_val = dfs(i, 0)\n  if (kind_val == 1) then\n    one = one + 1\n  else if (.not. mujun) then\n    bipartite = bipartite + 1\n  end if\nend do\n\nThis should correctly count the components.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nLooking at the Java code, it's a program that reads a graph and processes it to calculate some values. The main class implements Runnable, which suggests it's using a thread with a larger stack size, but maybe in Fortran that's not necessary. The key parts are the graph structure, the DFS traversal, and the counting of bipartite components and single-node components.\n\nFirst, the Java code uses an adjacency list (graph) represented as an array of ArrayLists. In Fortran, we can simulate this with arrays of arrays or using derived types. But Fortran's dynamic arrays might be a bit tricky. Let's think: each node has a list of connected nodes, so perhaps we can use an array of allocatable arrays, or a 2D array where each row has the neighbors. But since the size can vary, maybe using a jagged array structure.\n\nThe variables one, bipartite, count are used to track the number of single-node components, bipartite components (non-single), and total components. The DFS function checks if a component is bipartite by trying to color it with two colors and detecting any contradictions (cycles of odd length).\n\nIn Fortran, the main steps would be:\n\n1. Read n and m (number of nodes and edges).\n2. Build the adjacency list.\n3. Initialize visited array and color array.\n4. For each unvisited node, perform DFS to determine if it's a single node, bipartite, or non-bipartite.\n5. Calculate the total based on the counts.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures. In Fortran, we can represent the graph as an array of allocatable arrays. But how? Maybe using a derived type with an allocatable array. For example:\n\ntype Node\n  integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\nend type Node\n\ntype(Node), allocatable :: graph(:)\n\nBut Fortran doesn't allow arrays of allocatable components in some versions, so perhaps a better approach is to use a 2D array where each row has the neighbors, and another array to track the number of neighbors per node. Alternatively, we can use a linked list, but that's complicated. Alternatively, since the maximum number of edges per node is up to n-1, maybe pre-allocate a 2D array with enough space, but that's memory inefficient. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: use a single large array to store all the neighbors, and a pointer array to track the start and end indices for each node. For example, have a 1D array 'edges' that holds all the neighbors consecutively, and another array 'index' where index(i) points to the start of node i's neighbors. This is similar to compressed sparse row format. This might be more efficient in Fortran.\n\nBut for simplicity, maybe use a 2D allocatable array where each row is dynamically allocated to the size needed. Wait, but Fortran 2003 allows arrays of allocatable components. So perhaps:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: graph(:,:)  ! But this is rectangular, not jagged.\nNo, that won't work because each row can have different lengths. So maybe use an array of pointers to arrays. Wait, but Fortran doesn't have pointers in the same way. Alternatively, use a separate array for each node's neighbors. But that's impractical for a large n.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, store the neighbors in an allocatable array. So, in Fortran:\n\ntype :: NodeType\n  integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\nend type NodeType\n\ntype(NodeType), allocatable :: graph(:)\n\nThen, for each node i, graph(i)%neighbors is the list of neighbors. This should be possible in Fortran 2003 and later. But I need to check if the code will be compatible with compilers.\n\nOnce the graph is built, the DFS needs to be implemented. Java uses recursion for DFS, but Fortran's stack size may be limited, so for large graphs, recursion might cause stack overflow. However, the problem's constraints aren't given, but the original Java code uses a larger stack (128MB). But since Fortran can't easily control the stack size, perhaps an iterative DFS is better. But translating the recursive approach directly would be easier. Let's see.\n\nThe Java code's dfs function is recursive. Let's try to replicate that in Fortran. However, Fortran's recursion handling is not as straightforward. Each recursive call must be declared with the 'recursive' keyword.\n\nThe variables that are part of the class (like graph, visited, color, mujun, etc.) in Java are instance variables. In Fortran, these can be handled via module variables or passed as arguments. Using a module would make it easier, but perhaps better to pass them as arguments to avoid global state.\n\nBut the original code has these variables as instance variables. So, when translating to Fortran, maybe encapsulate them in a module or pass them as arguments.\n\nAlternatively, structure the code with modules. Let's outline the steps.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then, build the adjacency list. Then, perform DFS on each unvisited node.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Allocate the graph structure. For each node, read its edges and build the adjacency list.\n- Initialize visited as a logical array, color as an integer array (initially -1), and variables one, bipartite, count as 0.\n- Loop over all nodes. For each unvisited node, increment count, perform DFS, check if it's a single node (size 1) or bipartite.\n\nThe DFS function in Java returns the size of the component, and sets mujun (contradiction) if the component is not bipartite. So in Fortran, the DFS function needs to return the size and also modify a flag (mujun) that is passed in, or have side effects.\n\nBut Fortran functions can have intent(inout) arguments. So, the DFS could be a recursive function that takes the current node, current color, modifies visited, color arrays, updates mujun, and returns the total nodes in the component.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the dfs function is a method of the class, so it has access to the instance variables. In Fortran, if these variables are module variables, then the function can modify them directly. Alternatively, pass them as arguments.\n\nBut using modules for shared variables would make the code cleaner. Let's try that approach.\n\nSo, create a module that contains:\n\n- The graph (array of allocatable arrays)\n- visited array (logical)\n- color array (integer)\n- mujun flag (logical)\n- The counts (one, bipartite, count)\n\nBut in Fortran, modules encapsulate data, so all variables in the module are shared. That way, the recursive DFS can access them.\n\nBut Fortran's modules are similar to static variables in a class. So perhaps that's manageable.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\n1. Module variables:\n\nmodule graph_data\n  integer, allocatable :: color(:)\n  logical, allocatable :: visited(:)\n  logical :: mujun\n  integer :: n\n  integer, allocatable :: graph(:,:)  ! Hmm, but how to handle variable lengths?\n  ! Alternatively, use an array of arrays via a derived type.\n  type :: adj_list\n    integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\n  end type adj_list\n  type(adj_list), allocatable :: graph(:)\nend module graph_data\n\nThen, in the main program, after reading n and m, allocate graph(n), and for each node, read the edges and build the adjacency list.\n\nBut reading the edges: the Java code reads m edges, each connecting u and v (0-based, then adjusted to 1-based for Fortran?), but in Java, it's converted from 1-based to 0-based. Wait, the Java code subtracts 1 from u and v. So the input is 1-based. So in Fortran, since indices are 1-based by default, we can read u and v as is, and subtract 1 in Java. So in Fortran, no need to subtract.\n\nWait, the Java code reads u and v, subtracts 1 to make them 0-based. So in the input, nodes are 1-based. So when reading in Fortran, we can just use the 1-based indices directly.\n\nSo for each edge, u and v are input as 1-based. So for Fortran, when building the adjacency list, add v to u's list and u to v's list (since it's undirected).\n\nBut in the Java code, the graph is built as an undirected graph. So each edge is added to both u and v's adjacency lists.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each edge, after reading u and v (as integers), we add v to graph(u)%neighbors and u to graph(v)%neighbors.\n\nBut handling the adjacency list in Fortran:\n\nFor each node i, allocate the neighbors array as needed. For example, when adding a neighbor to u, we can append to the graph(u)%neighbors array.\n\nBut appending to an array in Fortran requires reallocating and copying. For efficiency, perhaps pre-allocate with a certain size, but for the sake of code translation, perhaps we can use a temporary array each time.\n\nAlternatively, for each edge, after reading u and v, we can do:\n\ntemp = [graph(u)%neighbors, v]\ncall move_alloc(temp, graph(u)%neighbors)\n\nSimilarly for v's adjacency list.\n\nThis might be a bit slow for large m, but for code translation purposes, it's manageable.\n\nNow, the DFS function. In Java, it's a recursive function. In Fortran, it's a recursive function declared as such.\n\nIn the module, the variables are accessible. So the function can modify visited, color, and mujun.\n\nThe DFS function in Java returns the size of the component. So in Fortran, the function will return an integer, and during the traversal, it marks visited, sets colors, checks for contradictions.\n\nSo the Fortran function could look like this:\n\nrecursive function dfs(a, c) result(total)\n  use graph_data\n  implicit none\n  integer, intent(in) :: a, c\n  integer :: total\n  integer :: b, i\n\n  if (visited(a)) then\n    if (color(a) >= 0 .and. color(a) /= c) then\n      mujun = .true.\n    end if\n    total = 0\n    return\n  end if\n\n  visited(a) = .true.\n  color(a) = c\n  total = 1\n\n  do i = 1, size(graph(a)%neighbors)\n    b = graph(a)%neighbors(i)\n    total = total + dfs(b, 1 - c)\n  end do\n\nend function dfs\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, array indices start at 1. So when we read u and v from input, they are 1-based. The graph is built accordingly.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after reading u and v (input as 1-based?), then subtract 1 to make 0-based. For example, input u is 1-based, converted to 0-based. So in the Fortran code, we read u and v as 1-based and leave them as is, since Fortran uses 1-based indexing by default.\n\nSo in Fortran, the adjacency lists are built with 1-based indices.\n\nNow, the main program:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nAllocate the graph array:\n\nallocate(graph(n))\n\nThen, for each node, initialize the neighbors array as empty. Initially, each graph(i)%neighbors is unallocated. For each edge, read u and v, then append v to graph(u)%neighbors and u to graph(v)%neighbors.\n\nBut how to append? For example, when adding a neighbor:\n\nsubroutine add_neighbor(node, neighbor)\n  type(adj_list), intent(inout) :: node\n  integer, intent(in) :: neighbor\n  integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n  if (.not. allocated(node%neighbors)) then\n    allocate(node%neighbors(1))\n    node%neighbors(1) = neighbor\n  else\n    temp = [node%neighbors, neighbor]\n    call move_alloc(temp, node%neighbors)\n  end if\nend subroutine add_neighbor\n\nBut then, for each edge (u, v):\n\ncall add_neighbor(graph(u), v)\ncall add_neighbor(graph(v), u)\n\nBut this may be time-consuming for large m, but for code correctness, it's acceptable.\n\nOnce the graph is built, initialize visited as .false., color as -1.\n\nThen, loop over all nodes:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n  if (visited(i)) cycle\n  count = count + 1\n  mujun = .false.\n  kind = dfs(i, 0)\n  if (kind == 1) then\n    one = one + 1\n  else if (.not. mujun) then\n    bipartite = bipartite + 1\n  end if\nend do\n\nWait, in Java, the initial color is 0. In Fortran, the color starts as 0 here. But color array was initialized to -1. So during the first call, visited is false, so we set color to 0, then proceed.\n\nWait, the Java code's color array is initialized to -1, and in the dfs, the color is set to c (0 or 1). So yes.\n\nThen, after processing all components, compute the total:\n\ntotal = one * (2 * n - one) + (count - one) * (count - one) + bipartite * bipartite\n\nWait, in the Java code, 'count' is the total number of components. 'one' is the number of components of size 1. 'bipartite' is the number of non-single components that are bipartite. The remaining components (count - one - bipartite) are non-bipartite. But in the calculation:\n\nThe Java code's total is:\n\nlong total = one * (2 * n - one);\ntotal += (count - one) * (count - one);\ntotal += bipartite * bipartite;\n\nWait, no. Wait the code says:\n\ntotal = one * (2 * n - one);\ntotal += (count - one) * (count - one);\ntotal += bipartite * bipartite;\n\nBut wait, (count - one) is the number of non-single components, which includes bipartite and non-bipartite. Then adding bipartite * bipartite seems confusing. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in understanding the code.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code:\n\nIn the loop:\n\nfor each unvisited i:\n\ncount++\n\nmujun = false\n\nkind = dfs(i, 0)\n\nif (kind == 1) one++\n\nelse if (!mujun) bipartite++\n\nSo, kind is the size of the component. If the size is 1, then it's counted in 'one'. Else, if mujun is false (the component is bipartite), then bipartite is incremented.\n\nThe non-bipartite components are those where mujun is true and kind > 1. These are not counted in 'bipartite' or 'one'.\n\nSo, the formula for total is:\n\ntotal = one * (2n - one)  // each single node can pair with all other nodes (including other singles and non-singles) but according to the problem's logic.\n\nThen, (count - one) is the number of non-single components. The code adds (count - one)^2. But then also adds bipartite^2. Wait, this seems incorrect. But perhaps the formula is:\n\nThe problem's logic is as follows:\n\nThe total is the sum of three parts:\n\n1. The number of pairs between single-node components and all other nodes (including other singles). So one * (n * 2 - one) ?\n\nWait, perhaps this part is for edges between single-node components and all possible nodes. But I'm not sure. The original problem might have a specific counting method which isn't clear from the code. But since our task is to translate the code, not to understand the problem, we can proceed.\n\nSo, the Fortran code needs to replicate the same calculation.\n\nNow, potential issues:\n\n1. Handling the graph as an array of dynamic arrays. In Fortran, each graph(i)%neighbors is an allocatable array.\n\n2. The recursive DFS function and stack size. For large n, this could be a problem, but the original Java code uses a larger stack. In Fortran, the stack size is compiler-dependent, but for code correctness, we proceed.\n\n3. The variables one, bipartite, count must be 64-bit integers if n is up to 1e5 or more. But in Fortran, integers are 4 bytes by default, but we can use integer(kind=8) for them.\n\nSo, declaring variables as integer(8) :: one, bipartite, count, total.\n\nAnother thing: the color array in Java is int[] color, initialized to -1. In Fortran, the color array is integer, initialized to -1.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, the module:\n\nmodule graph_data\n  implicit none\n  integer, allocatable :: color(:)\n  logical, allocatable :: visited(:)\n  logical :: mujun\n  integer :: n\n  type :: adj_list\n    integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\n  end type adj_list\n  type(adj_list), allocatable :: graph(:)\nend module graph_data\n\nThen, the main program:\n\nprogram main\n  use graph_data\n  implicit none\n  integer :: m, u, v, i, kind_val\n  integer(8) :: one, bipartite, count_val, total_val\n\n  read(*,*) n, m\n\n  allocate(graph(n))\n  do i = 1, n\n    allocate(graph(i)%neighbors(0))  ! Initially empty\n  end do\n\n  do i = 1, m\n    read(*,*) u, v\n    call add_neighbor(graph(u), v)\n    call add_neighbor(graph(v), u)\n  end do\n\n  allocate(visited(n), color(n))\n  visited = .false.\n  color = -1\n\n  one = 0\n  bipartite = 0\n  count_val = 0\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    if (visited(i)) cycle\n    count_val = count_val + 1\n    mujun = .false.\n    kind_val = dfs(i, 0)\n    if (kind_val == 1) then\n      one = one + 1\n    else if (.not. mujun) then\n      bipartite = bipartite + 1\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  total_val = one * (2 * n - one) + (count_val - one)**2 + bipartite**2\n  print *, total_val\n\ncontains\n\n  recursive function dfs(a, c) result(total)\n    integer :: a, c, total\n    integer :: b, i\n\n    if (visited(a)) then\n      if (color(a) >= 0 .and. color(a) /= c) then\n        mujun = .true.\n      end if\n      total = 0\n      return\n    end if\n\n    visited(a) = .true.\n    color(a) = c\n    total = 1\n\n    do i = 1, size(graph(a)%neighbors)\n      b = graph(a)%neighbors(i)\n      total = total + dfs(b, 1 - c)\n    end do\n\n  end function dfs\n\n  subroutine add_neighbor(node, neighbor)\n    type(adj_list), intent(inout) :: node\n    integer, intent(in) :: neighbor\n    integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n\n    if (.not. allocated(node%neighbors)) then\n      allocate(node%neighbors(1))\n      node%neighbors(1) = neighbor\n    else\n      call move_alloc(node%neighbors, temp)\n      allocate(node%neighbors(size(temp) + 1))\n      node%neighbors(1:size(temp)) = temp\n      node%neighbors(size(temp) + 1) = neighbor\n    end if\n  end subroutine add_neighbor\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but the 'add_neighbor' subroutine may have issues. Let's test it. For example, when node%neighbors is not allocated, we allocate it with size 1 and set the value. Otherwise, we create a temp array, then reallocate node%neighbors with size+1, copy the temp back, and add the neighbor. But in Fortran, when you move_alloc from node%neighbors to temp, the node%neighbors becomes deallocated, then allocate it with size+1. But move_alloc transfers the allocation, so temp is the old array, and node%neighbors is unallocated. Wait, no: move_alloc(source, dest) deallocates dest, then source is moved to dest. So in this case:\n\ncall move_alloc(node%neighbors, temp) would deallocate temp (if allocated), and then move the allocation from node%neighbors to temp. So after this, node%neighbors is deallocated, and temp has the old data.\n\nThen, allocate node%neighbors with size(temp)+1. Then copy temp into the first part, and add neighbor at the end.\n\nYes. So:\n\nsubroutine add_neighbor(node, neighbor)\n  type(adj_list), intent(inout) :: node\n  integer, intent(in) :: neighbor\n  integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n\n  if (.not. allocated(node%neighbors)) then\n    allocate(node%neighbors(1))\n    node%neighbors(1) = neighbor\n  else\n    call move_alloc(node%neighbors, temp)\n    allocate(node%neighbors(size(temp) + 1))\n    node%neighbors(1:size(temp)) = temp\n    node%neighbors(size(temp)+1) = neighbor\n  end if\nend subroutine add_neighbor\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, possible issues in the code:\n\n1. The initial allocation of graph(n) and then for each i from 1 to n, allocate(graph(i)%neighbors(0)). Wait, allocating an array of size 0 may not be allowed. Alternatively, perhaps we can just leave the neighbors unallocated and check for allocation in add_neighbor. So, in the main program, after allocating graph(n), each element's neighbors array is initially unallocated. Then, in the add_neighbor subroutine, the first time we check if it's allocated. So the code should handle that.\n\nBut in Fortran, the initial state of graph(i)%neighbors is unallocated, so the first time add_neighbor is called for a node, the if (.not. allocated(...)) clause will be triggered.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nAnother thing: in the main loop, after reading u and v, they are added to each other's adjacency lists. Since the nodes are 1-based, this is correct.\n\nThen, during DFS, the neighbors are accessed via graph(a)%neighbors. For nodes with no neighbors (size 0), the loop do i = 1, size(...) would not execute, which is correct.\n\nNow, testing for the case where a node has no neighbors. For example, if a component is a single node with no edges, then the DFS returns 1, and it's counted in 'one'.\n\nBut in the Java code, the 'kind' variable is the return value of dfs, which is the total number of nodes in the component. For a single node, it's 1. So in the Fortran code, when kind_val is 1, we increment 'one'.\n\nNow, in the main loop:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n  if (visited(i)) cycle\n  count_val = count_val + 1\n  mujun = .false.\n  kind_val = dfs(i, 0)\n  if (kind_val == 1) then\n    one = one + 1\n  else if (.not. mujun) then\n    bipartite = bipartite + 1\n  end if\nend do\n\nThis should correctly count the components.\n\nBut in the Java code, 'count' is the total number of components. 'one' is the number of components of size 1, 'bipartite' is the number of non-single components that are bipartite.\n\nNow, the calculation:\n\ntotal_val = one * (2 * n - one) + (count_val - one)**2 + bipartite**2\n\nWait, no. The Java code's calculation is:\n\nlong total = one * (2 * n - one);\ntotal += (count - one) * (count - one);\ntotal += bipartite * bipartite;\n\nWhich is:\n\ntotal = one*(2n - one) + (count - one)^2 + bipartite^2;\n\nBut in the Fortran code, (count_val - one) is the number of non-single components, which includes bipartite and non-bipartite. So (count_val - one)^2 would be the square of the sum of bipartite and non-bipartite components. But then adding bipartite^2 is part of it? That seems odd. But this is a direct translation of the Java code.\n\nBut perhaps the Java code's variables:\n\ncount is the total components.\n\none is the number of single-node components.\n\nbipartite is the number of non-single bipartite components.\n\ncount - one is the number of non-single components (bipartite + non-bipartite).\n\nThe Java code computes:\n\n(total is initialized as one*(2n - one))\n\nThen adds (count - one)^2. Then adds bipartite^2.\n\nBut (count - one) is bipartite + non_bipartite. So (count - one)^2 is (bipartite + non_bipartite)^2 = bipartite^2 + 2*bipartite*non_bipartite + non_bipartite^2. Then adding bipartite^2 makes total += (count - one)^2 + bipartite^2.\n\nWhich would be:\n\none*(2n - one) + (bipartite + non_bipartite)^2 + bipartite^2.\n\nBut the original problem's formula is unclear. However, since the task is to translate the code, not to understand the problem, we proceed.\n\nNow, potential issues in the Fortran code:\n\n1. The recursive function's depth. For large components, this could cause stack overflow. But in Java, they allocated a larger stack. Fortran doesn't have that option, so this code may fail for large components. However, the code is correct in terms of translation.\n\n2. The color array is initialized to -1, which is correct.\n\n3. The 'mujun' flag is correctly set during DFS.\n\nNow, test case:\n\nSuppose n=3, m=0. So three isolated nodes. Then each is a component of size 1. So count=3, one=3, bipartite=0. The total would be 3*(6 -3) + (3-3)^2 +0= 3*3=9.\n\nBut the Java code's output would be 9.\n\nAnother test case: a single component of size 2. Then, it's bipartite. So count=1, one=0, bipartite=1. total=0*(2*2-0) + (1-0)^2 +1^2= 0 +1 +1=2.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem's calculation is different. However, the code is being directly translated, so the Fortran code should replicate the Java code's logic.\n\nAnother potential issue is integer overflow. The Java code uses 'long' for one, bipartite, count. In Fortran, using integer(8) is necessary for large n. So variables like one, bipartite, count_val, total_val should be declared as integer(8).\n\nIn the code above, they are declared as integer(8), which is correct.\n\nAnother issue: when declaring 'dfs' as a recursive function, the 'result' clause is needed.\n\nIn the code:\n\nrecursive function dfs(a, c) result(total)\n  integer :: a, c, total\n\nBut the variables a and c are declared as integer, but in Fortran, the default integer is 4 bytes. Which should be okay as long as n is not too large. But in any case, the variables should match.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe final code should be structured as follows:\n\nmodule graph_data\n  implicit none\n  integer, allocatable :: color(:)\n  logical, allocatable :: visited(:)\n  logical :: mujun\n  integer :: n\n  type :: adj_list\n    integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\n  end type adj_list\n  type(adj_list), allocatable :: graph(:)\nend module graph_data\n\nprogram main\n  use graph_data\n  implicit none\n  integer :: m, u, v, i, kind_val\n  integer(8) :: one, bipartite, count_val, total_val\n\n  read(*,*) n, m\n\n  allocate(graph(n))\n\n  do i = 1, m\n    read(*,*) u, v\n    call add_neighbor(u, v)\n    call add_neighbor(v, u)\n  end do\n\n  allocate(visited(n), color(n))\n  visited = .false.\n  color = -1\n\n  one = 0\n  bipartite = 0\n  count_val = 0\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    if (visited(i)) cycle\n    count_val = count_val + 1\n    mujun = .false.\n    kind_val = dfs(i, 0)\n    if (kind_val == 1) then\n      one = one + 1\n    else if (.not. mujun) then\n      bipartite = bipartite + 1\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  total_val = one * (2 * n - one) + (count_val - one) ** 2 + bipartite ** 2\n  print *, total_val\n\ncontains\n\n  recursive function dfs(a, c) result(total)\n    integer, intent(in) :: a, c\n    integer :: total\n    integer :: b, i\n\n    if (visited(a)) then\n      if (color(a) >= 0 .and. color(a) /= c) then\n        mujun = .true.\n      end if\n      total = 0\n      return\n    end if\n\n    visited(a) = .true.\n    color(a) = c\n    total = 1\n\n    do i = 1, size(graph(a)%neighbors)\n      b = graph(a)%neighbors(i)\n      total = total + dfs(b, 1 - c)\n    end do\n\n  end function dfs\n\n  subroutine add_neighbor(u, v)\n    integer, intent(in) :: u, v\n    integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n\n    if (.not. allocated(graph(u)%neighbors)) then\n      allocate(graph(u)%neighbors(1))\n      graph(u)%neighbors(1) = v\n    else\n      call move_alloc(graph(u)%neighbors, temp)\n      allocate(graph(u)%neighbors(size(temp) + 1))\n      graph(u)%neighbors(1:size(temp)) = temp\n      graph(u)%neighbors(size(temp) + 1) = v\n    end if\n  end subroutine add_neighbor\n\nend program main\n\nWait, the add_neighbor subroutine now takes u and v, and adds v to graph(u)'s neighbors. So in the main loop, when reading each edge, u and v are passed to add_neighbor in both directions.\n\nBut in the previous code, the add_neighbor subroutine was called as call add_neighbor(graph(u), v). But in the current code, the add_neighbor subroutine is part of the main program and has access to the graph via the module.\n\nSo the current code's add_neighbor subroutine takes u and v, and adds v to graph(u)'s neighbors.\n\nThis is better, as it abstracts the graph structure.\n\nSo, in the main loop:\n\nfor each edge, read u and v:\n\ncall add_neighbor(u, v)\ncall add_neighbor(v, u)\n\nYes.\n\nPotential mistake: in Fortran, the loop after reading n and m:\n\ndo i = 1, m\n  read(*,*) u, v\n  call add_neighbor(u, v)\n  call add_neighbor(v, u)\nend do\n\nBut this would process each edge twice? No. Wait, each edge is processed once. For example, when you read an edge u-v, you add v to u's list and u to v's list. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: the initial allocation of the graph. After allocate(graph(n)), each graph(i)%neighbors is unallocated. So the first time add_neighbor is called for a node, it allocates the neighbors array.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with a simple case:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 0\n\nSo n=3, m=0. All nodes are isolated.\n\nProcessing:\n\nEach node has no neighbors.\n\nDFS for each node:\n\ni=1: visited is false. count_val becomes 1. Call dfs(1,0).\n\nIn dfs(1,0):\n\nvisited(1) is false. Set to true. color(1) =0.\n\ngraph(1)%neighbors is unallocated. So size(graph(1)%neighbors) is 0. The loop runs 0 times. Return 1.\n\nkind_val =1. So one is incremented.\n\nSame for i=2 and i=3. So count_val=3, one=3.\n\nTotal_val=3*(6-3) + (3-3)^2 +0^2 =9+0+0=9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1. Edge 1-2.\n\nThen, the component is bipartite.\n\ncount_val=1, one=0, bipartite=1.\n\nTotal_val=0*(4-0) + (1-0)^2 +1^2=0+1+1=2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the final code should have proper Fortran syntax, including module usage, the derived type for adj_list, and proper handling of allocatable arrays."
