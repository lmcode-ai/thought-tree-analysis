    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The program reads two strings, s and t. Then it calculates two values: ura and opa. Ura counts how many characters in s exactly match characters in t, and opa counts the case-insensitive matches after considering the remaining characters. \n\nFirst, I notice that in Java, they use a HashMap to track the counts of characters in t. So for Fortran, I need a way to represent this. Since Fortran doesn't have built-in hash maps, I'll have to use arrays to count each character's occurrences. \n\nCharacters in Java are Unicode, but perhaps the problem is limited to ASCII letters. The reverse function toggles the case, so for each character in s, after exact matches, we check if the opposite case exists in t.\n\nSo, let's plan the steps:\n\n1. Read strings s and t. In Fortran, we can read them as character variables. But note that in the Java code, s is a StringBuilder, which is mutable. So in Fortran, we can use a character array or a string that we modify.\n\n2. Create a count array for characters in t. Since we're dealing with letters (uppercase and lowercase), perhaps create two arrays for each case, but maybe a single array covering all possible ASCII characters. Wait, but handling the ASCII codes directly might be more efficient. For each character in t, increment the count in the corresponding position of the array. For example, for 'a', the index would be the ASCII value of 'a', and same for uppercase letters.\n\nBut Fortran has functions like ICHAR to get the ASCII code, and CHAR to convert back. So maybe create an array of size 0:255 (since ASCII is up to 127, but extended ASCII is 255) to cover all possible characters. But considering that the problem might only use letters, maybe we can map uppercase and lowercase letters to indices 1-52. Alternatively, use two separate arrays for lowercase and uppercase, but maybe it's easier to use a single array indexed by the ASCII value.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the reverse function swaps the case. So if the character is lowercase, we look for uppercase in t, and vice versa. So the counts need to track both cases.\n\nSo for each character in t, increment the count in the array at the corresponding ASCII value. Then, when processing s, first check for exact matches (same case), then for opposite case.\n\nSo let's create a t_count array of size 0:255, initialized to zero. For each character in t, convert it to its ASCII code and increment t_count(code).\n\nProcessing s in two passes:\n\nFirst pass (ura):\n\nFor each character in s, check if t_count[code] > 0. If yes, decrement t_count[code] and increment ura. Then mark that position in s as processed (but in the Java code, they replace the character with '\u042f', which is a sentinel value. In Fortran, perhaps we can track which positions have been processed, but since after the first pass, the second pass only checks the remaining characters, maybe we can just process the entire s twice. Wait, in Java, after the first loop, they replace the character with '\u042f' so that in the second loop, those positions are skipped. In Fortran, since strings are immutable, perhaps we need a logical array to track which positions have been used. Alternatively, since in the first pass, the code checks the original s, and after processing, those characters are 'removed' from t's count. Then in the second pass, when checking the opposite case, the count for the opposite case is considered. So maybe the same approach works.\n\nWait, the Java code first checks exact matches. For example, if s has 'a' and t has 'a', then ura is incremented. Then, in the second pass, for the same 'a' (if not used in ura), it checks for 'A' in t. But in the Java code, after the first pass, the s characters that were matched are replaced with '\u042f', so they are skipped in the second loop. So in the second loop, it only processes characters that were not matched in the first loop.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the first pass, how to track which characters in s were already used? Because the Java code modifies the s string by replacing the matched characters. So perhaps in Fortran, after the first pass, we can have a mask array indicating which positions were already matched, and in the second pass, skip those positions. Alternatively, process the entire s string in the second pass, but for each character, check if the opposite case exists in t's count.\n\nBut in the Java code, during the first pass, the tmap is modified (counts are decremented or removed). So during the second pass, the remaining counts in tmap are used. So for example, if t had two 'A's and s has one 'a' (which is matched in ura), then during the first pass, the 'a' in s is matched to 'A' in t. Wait no: in the first pass, the code checks the exact character. So if s has 'a', then in tmap, they check for 'a'. So if t has 'A's, those are separate. So the first pass only matches exact case. The second pass looks for the opposite case.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Count all characters in t, with their case.\n\n2. For each character in s, in order:\n\n   a. If the exact case exists in t's count, increment ura, decrement the count, and mark the character as processed (so it's not considered in the second pass).\n\n3. For each character in s, not processed in step 2:\n\n   b. If the opposite case exists in t's count, increment opa, decrement the count.\n\nSo in Fortran, how to model this?\n\nFirst, we can represent t's count with an array t_count(0:255), where each element is the count of the character with that ASCII code.\n\nFirst pass over s:\n\nLoop through each character in s. Get its ASCII code. If t_count(code) > 0, then increment ura, decrement t_count(code), and mark this position as used (so in the second pass, we can skip it). So we need a logical array used of the same length as s, initialized to .false.. After processing in the first pass, set used(i) to .true. for those positions.\n\nSecond pass over s:\n\nLoop through each character in s. For positions where used(i) is .false., get the character, find the opposite case. How to do that? For example, 'a' becomes 'A', 'B' becomes 'b', etc. So for a character, check if it's lowercase: if so, convert to uppercase. Else, convert to lowercase. Then check if the count of that opposite character is >0. If so, increment opa, decrement the count.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead s and t.\n\nInitialize t_count array to 0.\n\nFor each character in t:\n\n   code = ichar(c)\n\n   t_count(code) = t_count(code) + 1\n\nInitialize used array (size len(s)) to .false.\n\nProcess first pass (exact matches):\n\ndo i = 1, len(s)\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   code = ichar(c)\n\n   if (t_count(code) > 0) then\n\n      ura = ura + 1\n\n      t_count(code) = t_count(code) - 1\n\n      used(i) = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nProcess second pass (opposite case matches):\n\ndo i = 1, len(s)\n\n   if (used(i)) cycle\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n      opposite = achar(iachar(c) - 32)  ! lowercase to uppercase\n\n   else if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      opposite = achar(iachar(c) + 32)  ! uppercase to lowercase\n\n   else\n\n      cycle  ! not a letter, can't have opposite case\n\n   end if\n\n   code_opposite = ichar(opposite)\n\n   if (t_count(code_opposite) > 0) then\n\n      opa = opa + 1\n\n      t_count(code_opposite) = t_count(code_opposite) - 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen output ura and opa.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the first pass, the s string is modified so that matched characters are replaced with '\u042f', so in the second pass, those characters are skipped. In the Fortran approach, the used array serves the same purpose.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, handling the input. In Java, the code reads two strings: s and t. In Fortran, we can read them as character variables. However, Fortran's read statement may have issues with trailing spaces. So perhaps read them with format (a), which will read the entire line, but leading/trailing spaces may be a problem. But assuming that the input is given as two separate lines, each containing the respective string, we can read them as:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nread(*, '(a)') t\n\nBut in Fortran, the variables need to be declared with a fixed length. So we need to set a maximum length. Let's assume that the input strings are up to, say, 1e5 characters. But for code submission, perhaps use a large enough parameter.\n\nBut in practice, in code submission, it's better to use dynamic allocation or set a large enough size. Let's proceed with fixed-length variables, say, 200000 characters.\n\nSo variables:\n\ncharacter(len=200000) :: s, t\n\ninteger :: t_count(0:255) = 0\n\ninteger :: ura = 0, opa = 0\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: used\n\ninteger :: i, code, code_opposite\n\ncharacter :: c, opposite\n\nThen:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nread(*, '(a)') t\n\nBut in Fortran, trailing spaces may be included. For example, if the input line is shorter than the declared length of the variable, the rest is filled with spaces. So to get the actual length, we can trim the strings.\n\nBut the Java code uses scan.next(), which reads the next token (whitespace delimited). So in the Java code, the input is two words (without spaces). So in Fortran, we need to read the two strings, each as a single token, without spaces.\n\nWait, Java's Scanner.next() reads the next token, which is by default whitespace-delimited. So the input would be two lines, each containing a single token (the s and t strings). Or are the two tokens on the same line? Let's check the Java code.\n\nThe Java code does:\n\ns = new StringBuilder(scan.next());\n\nt = scan.next();\n\nSo scan.next() reads the next token. So input is two tokens, possibly separated by whitespace. So in Fortran, we can read the two strings from the same line or separate lines, but using list-directed input (read(*,*)), which splits on whitespace.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would read:\n\nread(*,*) s, t\n\nBut then, s and t would be read as the first and second tokens. However, in Fortran, the length of the variables must be sufficient. So declaring s and t with a sufficient length, say 200000 characters. But leading and trailing spaces may be an issue. But since the Java code uses next(), which trims whitespace, the Fortran code should read the same.\n\nSo the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_518_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=200000) :: s, t  ! Adjust the length as needed\n\ninteger :: t_count(0:255) = 0\n\ninteger :: ura = 0, opa = 0\n\nlogical, allocatable :: used(:)\n\ninteger :: i, code, code_opposite\n\ncharacter :: c, opposite\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) s, t  ! Assuming that the input is two tokens separated by whitespace\n\n! Trim the strings to their actual content (assuming that trailing spaces are not part of the string)\n\ns = adjustl(s)\n\nt = adjustl(t)\n\nBut wait, adjustl removes leading spaces, but the problem is that if the input string is shorter than the declared length, the remaining characters are filled with spaces. For example, if the input is \"abc\" for s, then the variable s will be \"abc\" followed by 199997 spaces. So when processing, we need to consider only the actual characters. So for the length of s and t, we can use len_trim to get the actual length.\n\nBut in the Java code, s and t can be any characters, including spaces? Well, the original code uses scan.next(), which splits on whitespace, so s and t can't contain spaces. So the Fortran code's read(*,*) will split on whitespace as well, so s and t are the first and second non-whitespace tokens.\n\nSo len_trim(s) gives the actual length of the s string.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\ns = trim(adjustl(s))  ! Maybe not necessary, but to get the actual string length.\n\nWait, adjustl moves leading spaces to the end, then trim removes trailing spaces. But perhaps using trim(s) directly would suffice. Wait, no: adjustl(s) shifts the string to the left, removing leading spaces, but then trim removes trailing spaces. But if the input is read as \"   abc   def   \", then s is \"   abc   \" and t is \"def   \" (assuming that the declared length is sufficient). So using trim(s) would give \"abc\", which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should process the entire s and t as per the original input. So perhaps the code should process all characters except leading and trailing whitespace? Because in Java's scan.next(), leading whitespace is skipped, and the token is read until the next whitespace. So in Fortran, read(*,*) s, t would read the first two whitespace-separated tokens, each stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. But in Fortran, when you read with list-directed input (read(*,*)), the variables are filled with the characters of the token, padded with spaces if the variable's length is longer than the token. So for example, if the token is \"hello\" and the variable is length 10, the variable will be \"hello     \" (five letters followed by five spaces). But when we process each character in s, we need to loop only up to the actual length of the token, not the padded spaces.\n\nThus, in the code, when processing s and t, we should loop up to len_trim(s) and len_trim(t).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, s and t are read as next(), which returns the next token as a String. So their lengths are the actual token lengths. So in Fortran, after reading, the actual s and t have lengths len_trim(s) and len_trim(t).\n\nSo, in the code:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(t)\n\n   c = t(i:i)\n\n   code = ichar(c)\n\n   t_count(code) = t_count(code) + 1\n\nend do\n\nThen, for processing s:\n\nallocate(used(len_trim(s)))\n\nused = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   code = ichar(c)\n\n   if (t_count(code) > 0) then\n\n      ura = ura + 1\n\n      t_count(code) = t_count(code) - 1\n\n      used(i) = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, second pass:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n   if (used(i)) cycle\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   ! Determine opposite case\n\n   if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n      opposite = achar(iachar(c) - 32)\n\n   else if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      opposite = achar(iachar(c) + 32)\n\n   else\n\n      cycle  ! Not a letter, skip\n\n   end if\n\n   code_opposite = ichar(opposite)\n\n   if (t_count(code_opposite) > 0) then\n\n      opa = opa + 1\n\n      t_count(code_opposite) = t_count(code_opposite) - 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, print ura and opa.\n\nNow, in Fortran, variables need to be declared properly. Also, the used array is allocated based on the length of s. Wait, len_trim(s) is the actual length. So in the code:\n\ninteger :: s_len, t_len\n\ns_len = len_trim(s)\n\nt_len = len_trim(t)\n\nallocate(used(s_len))\n\nBut in Fortran, the array indices start at 1 by default, which matches the loop from 1 to s_len.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program:\n\nprogram codeforces_518_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=200000) :: s, t  ! Adjust the length as needed\n\ninteger :: t_count(0:255) = 0\n\ninteger :: ura = 0, opa = 0\n\nlogical, allocatable :: used(:)\n\ninteger :: i, code, code_opposite, s_len, t_len\n\ncharacter :: c, opposite\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) s, t\n\ns = trim(s)\n\nt = trim(t)\n\ns_len = len(s)  ! No, wait: after trim, s is the trimmed string. Wait, no. The 'trim' function returns the string with trailing spaces removed. But in Fortran, when you assign s = trim(s), the variable s (with length 200000) is filled with the trimmed string followed by spaces. So to get the actual length, we need to compute len_trim(s).\n\nWait, no. For example, if s is read as \"abc   \" (with trailing spaces), then trim(s) is \"abc\", but when assigned to s (which is of length 200000), it becomes \"abc\" followed by 199997 spaces. So len_trim(s) is 3. So the correct approach is to compute s_len as len_trim(s), and t_len as len_trim(t).\n\nSo:\n\ns_len = len_trim(s)\n\nt_len = len_trim(t)\n\nThen, process t's characters:\n\ndo i = 1, t_len\n\n   c = t(i:i)\n\n   code = ichar(c)\n\n   t_count(code) = t_count(code) + 1\n\nend do\n\nThen allocate used for s's length:\n\nallocate(used(s_len))\n\nused = .false.\n\nProcess first pass:\n\ndo i = 1, s_len\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   code = ichar(c)\n\n   if (t_count(code) > 0) then\n\n      ura = ura + 1\n\n      t_count(code) = t_count(code) - 1\n\n      used(i) = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nProcess second pass:\n\ndo i = 1, s_len\n\n   if (used(i)) cycle\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n      opposite = achar(ichar(c) - 32)\n\n   else if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      opposite = achar(ichar(c) + 32)\n\n   else\n\n      cycle\n\n   end if\n\n   code_opposite = ichar(opposite)\n\n   if (t_count(code_opposite) > 0) then\n\n      opa = opa + 1\n\n      t_count(code_opposite) = t_count(code_opposite) - 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nprint *, ura, opa\n\nend program codeforces_518_B\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the 'ichar' function returns the ASCII code of the character, and 'achar' converts an integer to the corresponding character.\n\nBut we need to be careful with case conversion. For example, 'a' is ASCII 97, 'A' is 65. So subtracting 32 converts to uppercase, adding 32 converts to lowercase.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing edge cases. For example, if s has characters that are not letters. Then, in the second pass, they are skipped.\n\nAnother case: t has uppercase letters, and s has lowercase. Like s is \"a\", t is \"A\". Then ura is 0 (since exact case doesn't match), opa is 1.\n\nThe code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the Java code, when a character is found in tmap, the code removes or decrements the count. The Fortran code does the same with the t_count array.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the correct translation."
