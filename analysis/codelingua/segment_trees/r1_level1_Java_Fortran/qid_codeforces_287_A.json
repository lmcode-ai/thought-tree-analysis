    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java code reads 4 strings, each probably 4 characters long, right? Then it checks for a 2x2 square where at least three of the four characters are the same. The loops iterate over rows and columns to check adjacent characters. If such a square is found, it prints \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n1. Read 4 strings of length 4 each.\n2. Check each possible 2x2 block in the grid formed by these strings.\n3. For each block, check if there are at least three same characters in any configuration that meets the condition.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the differences between Java and Fortran. Fortran uses arrays differently, indices start at 1 by default, but maybe it's easier to adjust here. Also, Fortran strings are fixed-length, so we need to handle that.\n\nFirst, reading the input. Java reads four strings, each probably of length 4. In Fortran, we can declare a character array of length 4, with each element having a length of 4 characters. So maybe something like:\n\ncharacter(4), dimension(4) :: str\n\nThen, read each of the four lines. But in Fortran, when reading with READ *, the input is read as space-separated, but the original Java code uses sc.next(), which reads tokens. Wait, but in the Java code, the input is four lines each with a string. Wait, no. Wait, the original code uses sc.next() four times. Because in the loop, i starts at -1, then increments to 0, 1, 2, 3. So, the code reads four tokens, but perhaps each token is a 4-character string. So the input might be four lines each containing one 4-character string. Or maybe the input is given as four strings in a line. Hmm, but the original code's loop is while (i !=3 ), which increments i from -1 to 3 (since 3 is the exit condition). Wait, initial i is -1. The loop runs while i is not equal to 3. So the first iteration: i is -1, then i becomes 0. So in total, i runs 0,1,2,3. So four strings. So the code reads four strings, each stored in str[0] to str[3].\n\nIn Fortran, since arrays are 1-based by default, but perhaps we can adjust. So, perhaps in Fortran, we have str(1) to str(4). Then, the code loops from 1 to 4 to read each string.\n\nBut how to read the strings? In Fortran, each element of the array is a string of length 4. So when reading, each read statement would read a 4-character string. So perhaps:\n\ndo i = 1,4\n    read(*,*) str(i)\nend do\n\nBut that depends on how the input is given. If each input string is on a separate line, this would work. The original Java code uses sc.next(), which reads tokens, so perhaps the input could be four tokens in one line. But in practice, probably each string is on a line. So in Fortran, each read reads a line.\n\nThen, the next part is checking each possible 2x2 grid. In the Java code, u runs from 0 to 2 (since u starts at -1, increments to 0,1,2, but loop runs while u != 2. Wait, no: the loop is while (u != 2). The initial u is -1. Then u increments by 1 each loop. So first iteration u becomes 0, then 1, then 2. So u runs 0,1,2. So for each row from 0 to 2 (since the next row is u+1). Then for each column i from 0 to 2 (since the next column is i+1). So in the Java code, they check 3 rows (0,1,2) and 3 columns (0,1,2), making 3x3=9 possible 2x2 blocks.\n\nIn Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then rows would be 1 to 3, and columns 1 to 3. So we need to adjust the indices.\n\nThe condition in Java is a bit complex. Let's break it down:\n\nIf either of these is true:\n1. The current cell (u,i) and (u,i+1) are the same, and either (u+1,i) or (u+1,i+1) matches the same character.\nOR\n2. The cells (u+1,i) and (u+1,i+1) are the same, and either (u,i) or (u,i+1) matches the same character.\n\nSo in either case, there's a 2x2 block where three or all four characters are the same.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each u from 1 to 3 (rows), and i from 1 to 3 (columns), check the four cells: str(u)(i:i), str(u)(i+1:i+1), str(u+1)(i:i), str(u+1)(i+1:i+1).\n\nThe condition can be rewritten in Fortran. Let's see:\n\nFirst part:\n(str(u)(i) == str(u)(i+1) .AND. (str(u+1)(i) == str(u)(i) .OR. str(u+1)(i+1) == str(u)(i)) )\n\nOR\n\nSecond part:\n(str(u+1)(i) == str(u+1)(i+1) .AND. (str(u)(i) == str(u+1)(i) .OR. str(u)(i+1) == str(u+1)(i)) )\n\nWait, but in Java, the OR and AND have operator precedence, so parentheses are important. Let me make sure to structure the condition correctly with parentheses.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif ( ( ( str(u)(i:i) == str(u)(i+1:i+1) ) .and. ( ( str(u+1)(i:i) == str(u)(i:i) ) .or. ( str(u+1)(i+1:i+1) == str(u)(i:i) ) ) ) .or. &\n     ( ( str(u+1)(i:i) == str(u+1)(i+1:i+1) ) .and. ( ( str(u)(i:i) == str(u+1)(i:i) ) .or. ( str(u)(i+1:i+1) == str(u+1)(i:i) ) ) ) ) then\n\nBut this is quite complex. Need to make sure the parentheses are correct.\n\nAlternatively, break the condition into variables for clarity.\n\nBut for the sake of translation, perhaps keeping the structure similar.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loops would be:\n\ndo u = 1, 3\n    do i = 1, 3\n        check the four characters\n        if condition met, set yes = 1, print and exit\n    end do\nend do\n\nNow, in Fortran, we can exit loops once we find a condition. So perhaps, once a 'yes' is found, break out of all loops.\n\nIn Java, they have a 'yes' variable. Similarly, in Fortran, we can have a logical variable, say, found.\n\nInitialize found as .false.\n\nThen, loop over u from 1 to 3:\n\ndo u = 1, 3\n    do i = 1, 3\n        check the condition\n        if (condition) then\n            print *, \"YES\"\n            found = .true.\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n    if (found) exit\nend do\n\nIf after all loops, found is still .false., print \"NO\".\n\nThat's the approach.\n\nSo putting this all together.\n\nNow, the Fortran code:\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\nprogram codeforces_287_A\n    implicit none\n    character(4), dimension(4) :: str\n    integer :: i, u\n    logical :: found\n\n    ! Read input\n    do i = 1, 4\n        read(*, '(A)') str(i)\n    end do\n\n    found = .false.\n\n    ! Check each 2x2 block\n    do u = 1, 3\n        do i = 1, 3\n            ! Check the two conditions\n            if ( ( ( str(u)(i:i) == str(u)(i+1:i+1) ) .and. ( ( str(u+1)(i:i) == str(u)(i:i) ) .or. ( str(u+1)(i+1:i+1) == str(u)(i:i) ) ) .or. &\n                 ( ( str(u+1)(i:i) == str(u+1)(i+1:i+1) ) .and. ( ( str(u)(i:i) == str(u+1)(i:i) ) .or. ( str(u)(i+1:i+1) == str(u+1)(i:i) ) ) ) ) then\n                print *, \"YES\"\n                found = .true.\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (found) exit\n    end do\n\n    if (.not. found) then\n        print *, \"NO\"\n    end if\nend program codeforces_287_A\n\nWait, but there's a mistake here. Let's recheck the condition.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nif ((str[u].charAt(i) == str[u].charAt(i + 1)\n        && (str[u + 1].charAt(i) == str[u].charAt(i)\n                || str[u + 1].charAt(i + 1) == str[u].charAt(i)))\n        || (str[u + 1].charAt(i) == str[u + 1].charAt(i + 1)\n                && (str[u].charAt(i) == str[u + 1].charAt(i)\n                        || str[u].charAt(i + 1) == str[u + 1].charAt(i)))) \n\nLet's parse the first part:\n\n(str[u][i] == str[u][i+1]) AND (str[u+1][i] == str[u][i] OR str[u+1][i+1] == str[u][i])\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\n(str(u)(i:i) == str(u)(i+1:i+1)) .and. ( (str(u+1)(i:i) == str(u)(i:i)) .or. (str(u+1)(i+1:i+1) == str(u)(i:i) ) )\n\nSimilarly, the second part:\n\n(str[u+1][i] == str[u+1][i+1]) AND ( (str[u][i] == str[u+1][i]) OR (str[u][i+1] == str[u+1][i]) )\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\n(str(u+1)(i:i) == str(u+1)(i+1:i+1)) .and. ( (str(u)(i:i) == str(u+1)(i:i)) .or. (str(u)(i+1:i+1) == str(u+1)(i:i)) )\n\nSo combining the two with OR:\n\ncondition = ( ( (a .and. (b .or. c)) ) .or. ( (d .and. (e .or. f)) ) )\n\nWhere a, b, c, d, e, f are the parts.\n\nBut in the code I wrote earlier, I might have misplaced parentheses. Let's re-express the condition properly.\n\nOriginal Java condition:\n\n( (A && (B || C)) || (D && (E || F)) )\n\nWhere:\n\nA = str[u][i] == str[u][i+1]\nB = str[u+1][i] == str[u][i]\nC = str[u+1][i+1] == str[u][i]\nD = str[u+1][i] == str[u+1][i+1]\nE = str[u][i] == str[u+1][i]\nF = str[u][i+1] == str[u+1][i]\n\nSo in Fortran, the condition should be:\n\n( (A .and. (B .or. C)) .or. (D .and. (E .or. F)) )\n\nBut in the code I wrote earlier, perhaps the grouping is wrong. Let me check:\n\nIn the previous code:\n\n.and. ( ( ... ) .or. ( ... ) )\n\nWait, in the first part:\n\n( str(u)(i:i) == str(u)(i+1:i+1) ) .and. ( ( str(u+1)(i:i) == str(u)(i:i) ) .or. ( str(u+1)(i+1:i+1) == str(u)(i:i) )\n\nNo, that's incorrect. Because in Java, it's (A && (B || C)), but in the code above, the Fortran has A .and. B .or. C, which is (A and B) or C, which is not the same.\n\nAh, right! That's a mistake. The parentheses in the Fortran code were incorrect. Because in Java, the condition is:\n\nA && (B || C)\n\nWhich means A must be true, and either B or C must be true. In the Fortran code I wrote earlier, the code was:\n\n.and. ( ( ... ) .or. ( ... ) )\n\nBut the way it's written in the code is:\n\n( ( str(u)(i:i) == str(u)(i+1:i+1) ) .and. ( ( str(u+1)(i:i) == str(u)(i:i) ) .or. ( str(u+1)(i+1:i+1) == str(u)(i:i) ) ) )\n\nYes, that's correct. Because the .and. is between the first part and the parenthetical ( B .or. C ). So that's correct.\n\nSo the first part is (A .and. (B .or. C)), then OR with (D .and. (E .or. F)).\n\nSo in Fortran, the condition should be written as:\n\n( ( (A .and. (B .or. C)) ) .or. ( (D .and. (E .or. F)) ) )\n\nSo the Fortran code's condition should be:\n\nif ( ( ( (str(u)(i:i) == str(u)(i+1:i+1)) .and. ( (str(u+1)(i:i) == str(u)(i:i)) .or. (str(u+1)(i+1:i+1) == str(u)(i:i)) ) ) .or. &\n       ( (str(u+1)(i:i) == str(u+1)(i+1:i+1)) .and. ( (str(u)(i:i) == str(u+1)(i:i)) .or. (str(u)(i+1:i+1) == str(u+1)(i:i)) ) ) ) then\n\nYes, that's correct. So the code in the previous example has the correct condition.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when comparing substrings, it's necessary to use the correct syntax. For example, str(u)(i:i) gives the i-th character of the u-th string. Each string is of length 4, so i can be from 1 to 4.\n\nIn the loops, u runs from 1 to 3 (since u+1 must be <=4), and i runs from 1 to 3 (since i+1 <=4). So the loops are correct.\n\nNow, testing this code. For example, input like:\n\n##..\n##..\n....\n....\n\nShould output YES, but let's see.\n\nAnother thing: in the original Java code, once a 'yes' is found, it breaks out of all loops and prints. The Fortran code does the same with the 'found' variable and exiting the loops.\n\nEdge cases: all 2x2 blocks have exactly two same characters, so output is NO.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, when reading the strings, if the input lines are longer than 4 characters, they'll be truncated. If shorter, perhaps padded with spaces, but the original Java code's input probably ensures exactly four characters.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nThus, the translated Fortran code should be as written."
