    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's look at the Java code first. The main goal seems to be counting numbers made up of 3, 5, 7 digits that contain all three digits. The approach here starts with 357 and increments in a certain way, checking each number up to N.\n\nFirst, the main loop starts at i=357 and goes up to N. For each i, it checks if the string contains 3, 5, and 7. If yes, increments the count. Then, it generates the next number by looking at each digit from the end. The code seems to generate the next possible number by changing digits in a specific pattern. For example, if the digit is 3, it changes to 5, and so on. If there's a change, it appends the rest as 3s. Then reverses to get the next number.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's outline the steps.\n\n1. Reading input: The Java code reads an integer N. In Fortran, we can use READ(*,*) N.\n\n2. The main loop starts with i=357 and increments in a custom way. So, we need to handle the logic that generates the next i. The Java code uses a string manipulation approach. So, in Fortran, we'll need to convert the number to a string, process each character, then convert back to a number.\n\n3. String handling: Fortran has strings, but they are fixed-length. However, we can work with them. For each i, convert to a string, check if it contains '3', '5', '7'. Then, generate the next number by processing each digit from right to left.\n\nWait, the Java code uses a loop to process each digit from the end. For example, j is the index from the end. So, for each position, if the digit is 3, replace with 5 and set a flag. If 5, replace with 7. Else, replace with 3. But there's a flag 'f' which, once set, appends the remaining digits as they are. Wait, no. Let me recheck the code.\n\nThe Java code creates a new string by processing each digit from right to left. For each digit:\n\n- If the flag f is true, append the digit as is.\n- Else:\n   - If the digit is 3, replace with 5 and set f to true.\n   - Else if digit is 5, replace with 7 and set f to true.\n   - Else (digit is 7?), replace with 3 (and f remains false).\n- After processing all digits, if f is still false (meaning no change happened?), append 3.\n\nThen reverse the string and parse it as the next i.\n\nSo the next number is generated by incrementing the current number in a way similar to counting in base 3, but with digits 3,5,7. Each step increments the number, but with the digits cycling 3\u21925\u21927\u21923 and carrying over.\n\nSo for example, 357 becomes 375. Wait, let's see:\n\nTake i=357. The digits are '3','5','7'. Process from the end (right to left):\n\nFirst digit (rightmost) is 7. Since f is false, check: it's 7, so replace with 3. Append '3' to the new string. f remains false.\n\nNext digit (middle) is 5. f is false. Replace with 7, set f to true. Append '7'. Now, f is true, so the next digits (leftmost) are added as is. The leftmost digit is 3. Since f is true, append '3'.\n\nSo the new string after processing all digits is '3', '7', '3' (since we processed right to left, but the loop is j from 0 to length-1, and a is s.charAt(s.length()-1 -j). So for j=0, a is last character (7). j=1 is middle (5), j=2 is first (3).\n\nWait, for s = \"357\", s.length is 3. j runs from 0 to 2.\n\nFor j=0: s.length-1 -j = 2-0=2? Wait, no. s.length() is 3. So s.length()-1 is 2. s.length()-1 - j when j=0 is 2-0=2. So j=0 corresponds to the third character (index 2 in Java), which is 7. Then j=1 gives 2-1=1: the second character (5), and j=2 gives 2-2=0: first character (3).\n\nSo processing digits from right to left (7,5,3). For each:\n\nProcessing 7: since f is false. So replace with 3. Add to sb. f remains false.\n\nProcessing 5: f is false. Replace with 7, set f to true. Add '7' to sb. Now, any remaining digits (the first character, 3) are processed with f true.\n\nProcessing 3: f is true, so append as is. So the new sb is '3' (from first 7), then '7' (from 5), then '3' (from original 3). So the new sb is '373'.\n\nBut then, after processing all digits, if f is false (which in this case, after processing 5, f became true), then we don't append 3. So the sb is '373'. Then we reverse it, so the new number is '373' reversed becomes '373' (since it's 3 digits). Wait, no. Wait, the sb is being built by appending each processed digit. For example, processing 7 becomes 3 (added first), then 5 becomes 7 (added next), then 3 becomes 3 (added third). So the sb is '3', '7', '3' \u2192 \"373\". Then reverse \u2192 \"373\", which is 373. So the next i is 373. Then check if this is <= N.\n\nWait, but the original code's example seems to have a way to generate numbers like 357, 373, 533, etc. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, the key is to replicate this digit processing in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are 1-based and fixed-length, but we can handle them dynamically using trim and adjustl.\n\nSo, first, for the main loop:\n\nInitialize i as 357, count c=0.\n\nLoop while i <= N.\n\nFor each i:\n\nConvert i to a string, check if it contains '3', '5', '7' all. If yes, increment c.\n\nThen generate the next i.\n\nTo generate the next i:\n\nProcess each digit from right to left.\n\nWe'll need to reverse the string, process each character, then reverse again?\n\nWait, in Java, they process from the end (right to left). So, perhaps in Fortran, we can reverse the string, process from left to right (which is original right to left), then reverse again.\n\nAlternatively, process the original string from the end (right to left) by looping from the last character to first.\n\nLet me think.\n\nLet's take the string s as the current i's string.\n\nIn Fortran, the length of s is len_trim(s). Let's assume s is trimmed.\n\nLoop over j from len_trim(s) down to 1.\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop would need to go from len_trim(s) to 1, step -1.\n\nFor each character in s(j), process it as per the Java code.\n\nBut how to build the new string.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the processing starts from the rightmost digit (the end of the string), and builds a new string by appending the transformed digits. Then after processing all digits, if no transformation happened (f is false), append a 3. Then reverse the new string and parse as the next i.\n\nSo, perhaps in Fortran:\n\n- Convert i to a string s.\n\n- Reverse s (since we need to process from right to left, but in the original order, processing right to left is equivalent to processing the reversed string left to right).\n\nWait, perhaps reversing the string would make it easier to process from left to right, which would correspond to the original right to left.\n\nFor example, the original s is '357', reversed is '753'. Processing each character left to right (7,5,3) which is the same as processing the original digits right to left.\n\nSo, reverse s into reversed_s.\n\nProcess each character in reversed_s.\n\nInitialize a flag f as .false.\n\nInitialize a new string buffer (sb) as empty.\n\nFor each j from 1 to len(reversed_s):\n\n   char = reversed_s(j:j)\n\n   if (f) then\n\n       sb = sb // char\n\n   else\n\n       if char == '3' then\n\n           sb = sb // '5'\n\n           f = .true.\n\n       else if (char == '5') then\n\n           sb = sb // '7'\n\n           f = .true.\n\n       else if (char == '7') then\n\n           sb = sb // '3'\n\n           f = .false.  ! since we changed 7 to 3, but no carry over?\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\nWait, wait. Wait, in the Java code, when a digit is processed and a change is made (like 3\u21925), then the flag f is set to true, and the rest of the digits are processed as-is. Wait no. Let's look again.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nfor each digit (processed from right to left):\n\nif f is false:\n\n   if digit is 3 \u2192 replace with 5, set f to true.\n\n   else if 5 \u2192 replace with 7, set f to true.\n\n   else (7?) \u2192 replace with 3, f remains false.\n\nSo, for example, 7 becomes 3, but since f is still false, the next digit (to the left) will be processed similarly.\n\nBut once any digit is changed (3\u21925, 5\u21927), then f is set to true, and the remaining digits (to the left) are appended as is.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor each digit (starting from right to left):\n\nif (f) then append the digit as is.\n\nelse:\n\n   check the current digit. If 3 becomes 5, set f to true. So, after that, the next digits (to the left) are processed as is.\n\nFor example, if the original digits are 3 5 7 (357), reversed is 753. Processing reversed digits:\n\nFirst digit (7) \u2192 since f is false, it's 7 \u2192 becomes 3. f remains false.\n\nThen next digit (5) \u2192 since f is false \u2192 becomes 7, f is true.\n\nThird digit (3) \u2192 since f is true \u2192 append as is.\n\nSo the new reversed string is '3' (from 7\u21923) then '7' (from 5\u21927), then '3' (as is). So new reversed string is '373', which when reversed becomes 373.\n\nSo the next i is 373.\n\nBut how to handle this in Fortran.\n\nLet me outline the steps again.\n\nAfter reversing the string, process each character:\n\nInitialize sb as empty, f as false.\n\nLoop over each character in the reversed string:\n\nif f is true:\n\n   append the current character as-is.\n\nelse:\n\n   if current is '3' \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\n   else if current is '5' \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\n   else if current is '7' \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false, append a '3'.\n\nThen reverse the new sb to get the next i.\n\nWait, the Java code appends a 3 if f is false. Let's see:\n\nIn Java code, after processing all digits, if f is false (meaning no digits were changed with 3\u21925 or 5\u21927?), then append a '3' to the sb.\n\nWait, when would f be false after processing all digits? Only if all digits were 7. Because each 7 would be changed to 3, and since f remains false, after processing all digits, f is still false. So, for example, if the original number is 777.\n\nProcessing each 7 \u2192 3, f remains false. Then, after processing all digits, append '3'. Then reverse.\n\nOriginal 777 \u2192 reversed is 777. Process each 7 \u2192 3, so sb is '333', then append '3' \u2192 '3333'. Reverse \u2192 '3333' (since it's 4 digits). So next i is 3333.\n\nWait, but the Java code's while loop starts at 357. So maybe the code is generating numbers that only have 3,5,7 digits. But the check is done via the s.contains(\"3\") etc.\n\nSo the approach here is to generate numbers in the order where digits are 3,5,7, but in a way that increments the number by changing digits from the right.\n\nSo, back to Fortran.\n\nWe need to:\n\n1. Convert i to a string.\n\n2. Reverse the string.\n\n3. Process each character in the reversed string, building a new string.\n\n4. If after processing all characters, f is false, append a '3'.\n\n5. Reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nFor example, for i=357:\n\ns = '357'\n\nreversed_s = '753'\n\nprocess each character in reversed_s:\n\nfirst character '7' \u2192 f is false, so replace with '3', f remains false.\n\nsecond character '5' \u2192 replace with '7', f becomes true.\n\nthird character '3' \u2192 since f is true, append as '3'.\n\nsb after processing reversed_s is '3' '7' '3' \u2192 '373'.\n\nThen reverse sb \u2192 '373' \u2192 next i is 373.\n\nIn code:\n\nsubroutine next_i(current_i, next_i_val)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: current_i\n\n    integer, intent(out) :: next_i_val\n\n    character(len=20) :: s, reversed_s, sb\n\n    integer :: j, len_s\n\n    logical :: f\n\n    sb = ''\n\n    write(s, '(I0)') current_i  ! Convert to string\n\n    len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n    reversed_s = s(len_s:1:-1)  ! Reverse the string, e.g., '357' becomes '753'\n\n    f = .false.\n\n    do j = 1, len_trim(reversed_s)\n\n        if (f) then\n\n            sb = trim(sb) // reversed_s(j:j)\n\n        else\n\n            select case (reversed_s(j:j))\n\n                case ('3')\n\n                    sb = trim(sb) // '5'\n\n                    f = .true.\n\n                case ('5')\n\n                    sb = trim(sb) // '7'\n\n                    f = .true.\n\n                case ('7')\n\n                    sb = trim(sb) // '3'\n\n                    f = .false.\n\n            end select\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (.not. f) then\n\n        sb = trim(sb) // '3'\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Now reverse sb to get the new number\n\n    len_s = len_trim(sb)\n\n    reversed_s = sb(len_s:1:-1)\n\n    read(reversed_s, *) next_i_val\n\nend subroutine\n\nBut handling strings in Fortran can be tricky. Need to make sure the string lengths are handled properly.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, when you reverse a string, the indexes are a bit different. For example, '357' reversed is '753', which is s(3:1:-1) (assuming s is '357' stored as 3 characters).\n\nAnother thing: when building sb, each append may need to trim to avoid leading spaces. Also, in Fortran, the concatenation operator // will include trailing spaces unless the strings are trimmed.\n\nBut perhaps using a character variable with sufficient length and trimming as needed.\n\nWait, the code in Java uses a StringBuilder to build the new string. In Fortran, we can use a character variable initialized as empty and append characters as we go.\n\nBut Fortran's strings are fixed-length, so we need to manage their lengths. Let's use a sufficiently large character buffer.\n\nFor example, declare sb as character(100) to handle up to 100 digits (which is more than enough for practical N values).\n\nBut when appending, trim the current sb and add the new character. For example:\n\nsb = trim(sb) // '5'\n\nBut when sb is empty, trim(sb) is empty, so this appends the new character.\n\nThen, after processing all characters, if f is .false., append '3'.\n\nOnce sb is built, reverse it again to get the next number.\n\nSo, the code for generating next_i would be a function or subroutine.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can return integer values, so perhaps write a function that takes current_i and returns next_i.\n\nBut let's outline the main steps:\n\nProgram structure:\n\n- Read N from input.\n\n- Initialize i as 357, c as 0.\n\n- Loop while i <= N.\n\n   - Check if the digits of i contain 3, 5, and 7.\n\n   - If yes, increment c.\n\n   - Generate next_i.\n\n- Print c.\n\nThe check for containing 3,5,7 can be done by checking if each digit is one of them and that all three are present.\n\nIn Fortran, for a string s:\n\nlogical :: has3, has5, has7\n\nhas3 = .false.\n\nhas5 = .false.\n\nhas7 = .false.\n\ndo j = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n    select case (s(j:j))\n\n        case ('3')\n\n            has3 = .true.\n\n        case ('5')\n\n            has5 = .true.\n\n        case ('7')\n\n            has7 = .true.\n\n    end select\n\nend do\n\nif (has3 .and. has5 .and. has7) then\n\n    c = c + 1\n\nend if\n\nBut need to ensure that the number consists only of 3,5,7 digits, and includes all three.\n\nWait, no. The Java code checks if s contains '3', '5', and '7'. So the number must have at least one of each. So in Fortran, after checking all digits, if has3 and has5 and has7 are all true, increment c.\n\nBut also, the Java code's generated numbers are made up of 3,5,7 digits. Because the way next_i is generated. So during the check, perhaps the digits are always 3,5,7. But maybe not, because when the code appends a 3 in the end if f is false. Wait, when f is false, it appends a 3. So all generated numbers have digits 3,5,7. Therefore, in the check, perhaps the code can assume that the digits are 3,5,7, but the check is still needed to ensure all three are present.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the check is needed.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the main loop.\n\nRead N.\n\ni = 357\n\nc = 0\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n    ! Check if i contains 3,5,7.\n\n    write(s, '(I0)') i\n\n    call check_contains(s, has3, has5, has7)\n\n    if (has3 .and. has5 .and. has7) then\n\n        c = c + 1\n\n    end if\n\n    !

Because the Java code reverses the string buffer.\n\nIn Java, the code builds the sb by processing the digits from right to left (original digits), appending the transformed digits. Then reverses the sb to get the new number.\n\nFor example, in Java:\n\nOriginal digits are 357 \u2192 processed to 373 (sb is 373), then reversed to 373. So the next i is 373.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, processing reversed_s (original s reversed) left to right (so right to left of original). So for 357 \u2192 reversed_s is 753. Processing each character (7,5,3):\n\n7 \u2192 3 (f remains false).\n\n5 \u2192 7 (f becomes true).\n\n3 \u2192 append as is (since f is true).\n\nSo sb becomes '3' '7' '3' \u2192 '373'.\n\nThen, reversed_s is sb reversed \u2192 '373' reversed is '373', so next_i is 373.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: i=373.\n\ns = '373', reversed_s is '373'.\n\nProcessing each character:\n\n3 \u2192 5 (f becomes true).\n\n7 \u2192 append as is (f is true).\n\n3 \u2192 append as is (f is true).\n\nSo sb is '5' '7' '3'.\n\nThen reverse to get '375'.\n\nSo next i is 375.\n\nYes, that matches the expected sequence.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, testing edge cases. For example, when all digits are 7.\n\ncurrent_i = 777.\n\ns = '777', reversed_s is '777'.\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nj=1: '7' \u2192 '3', f remains false.\n\nj=2: '7' \u2192 '3', f remains false.\n\nj=3: '7' \u2192 '3', f remains false.\n\nAfter processing all digits, f is false, so append '3' \u2192 sb is '3333'.\n\nReverse to get '3333', which is next_i = 3333.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother case: current_i is 335.\n\nreversed_s is 533.\n\nProcessing:\n\nj=1: 5 \u2192 7, f becomes true.\n\nj=2: 3 \u2192 append as is (f is true).\n\nj=3:3 \u2192 append as is (f is true).\n\nsb is '733'.\n\nreverse to get '337', next_i is 337.\n\nBut then, when processing 337, the check will see if it has 3,5,7. But 337 has 3 and 7, no 5 \u2192 so not counted.\n\nSo the code will correctly skip it.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, handling the initial value of i=357. But what if N is less than 357? Then the loop doesn't run, and c remains 0.\n\nNow, translating all this to Fortran code.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Fortran's string handling can be tricky with trimming and leading/trailing spaces.\n\n- When reversing a string, the indices must be correct.\n\n- The next_i subroutine must correctly generate the next value.\n\nNow, coding.\n\nThe program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: N, c, i, i_new\n\n    read(*,*) N\n\n    c = 0\n\n    i = 357\n\n    do while (i <= N)\n\n        call check_and_count(i, c)\n\n        call next_i(i, i_new)\n\n        i = i_new\n\n    end do\n\n    print *, c\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine check_and_count(num, cnt)\n\n        integer, intent(in) :: num\n\n        integer, intent(inout) :: cnt\n\n        character(20) :: s\n\n        logical :: has3, has5, has7\n\n        integer :: j\n\n        write(s, '(I0)') num\n\n        has3 = .false.\n\n        has5 = .false.\n\n        has7 = .false.\n\n        do j = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n            select case (s(j:j))\n\n                case ('3')\n\n                    has3 = .true.\n\n                case ('5')\n\n                    has5 = .true.\n\n                case ('7')\n\n                    has7 = .true.\n\n            end select\n\n        end do\n\n        if (has3 .and. has5 .and. has7) cnt = cnt + 1\n\n    end subroutine\n\n    subroutine next_i(current, next)\n\n        integer, intent(in) :: current\n\n        integer, intent(out) :: next\n\n        character(20) :: s, reversed_s, sb\n\n        integer :: len_s, j\n\n        logical :: f\n\n        write(s, '(I0)') current\n\n        len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n        reversed_s = s(len_s:1:-1)\n\n        sb = ''\n\n        f = .false.\n\n        do j = 1, len_s\n\n            if (f) then\n\n                sb = trim(sb) // reversed_s(j:j)\n\n            else\n\n                select case (reversed_s(j:j))\n\n                    case ('3')\n\n                        sb = trim(sb) // '5'\n\n                        f = .true.\n\n                    case ('5')\n\n                        sb = trim(sb) // '7'\n\n                        f = .true.\n\n                    case ('7')\n\n                        sb = trim(sb) // '3'\n\n                        f = .false.\n\n                end select\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        if (.not. f) then\n\n            sb = trim(sb) // '3'\n\n        end if\n\n        len_s = len_trim(sb)\n\n        if (len_s == 0) then\n\n            s = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            s = sb(len_s:1:-1)\n\n        end if\n\n        read(s, *) next\n\n    end subroutine\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in the next_i subroutine, after building sb, we need to reverse it to get the new string. Then read that into next.\n\nBut in Fortran, when reversing a string like '373', reversing gives '373', which is the same. For '3333', reversed is the same. But for '733', reversed is '337'.\n\nBut the code as written seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In Fortran, when you write a number to a string using '(I0)', leading zeros are not present. So for i=3, the string is '3'.\n\n- When reversing the string, the code uses s(len_s:1:-1), which correctly reverses the string.\n\nTesting the code with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nN=357\n\nThe code starts with i=357. Check if it has 3,5,7 \u2192 yes, c=1. Generate next_i=373.\n\nBut 373>357? No. So loop ends. Output is 1.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nN=373\n\nLoop:\n\ni=357 \u2192 yes, count 1.\n\nnext_i=373 \u2192 <=373. Check if 373 has 3,7, but no 5. So c remains 1.\n\nGenerate next_i: 373 \u2192 reversed_s is '373'.\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nj=1: '3' \u2192 '5', f=true.\n\nj=2: '7' \u2192 appended as is.\n\nj=3: '3' \u2192 appended as is.\n\nsb is '573' \u2192 reversed is '375'.\n\nSo next_i is 375.\n\nCheck 375 \u2192 contains 3,7,5. So c=2.\n\nThen next_i is generated for 375.\n\nBut if N=375, then 375 is <=375. So c becomes 2.\n\nBut the loop would process i=357, 373, 375.\n\nSo for N=375, the count would be 2.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPossible errors:\n\n- The next_i subroutine may not handle leading zeros after reversal. But since all numbers are generated as per the Java code, which starts with 357 and increments properly, leading zeros should not be an issue.\n\n- Fortran's trim function removes trailing spaces, but in the code, when building sb, each append is done with trim(sb) to avoid trailing spaces. However, when reversing sb to get the new number, leading zeros could be a problem. But since the generated numbers are integers, leading zeros are not present in the string representation.\n\nFor example, if the sb after processing is '0333', reversing would be '3330', which would read as 3330, but according to the algorithm, this is impossible, since the generated numbers have digits 3,5,7 only.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nAnother thing: the next_i subroutine may generate a number that's larger than N, which is handled by the loop condition.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should correctly translate the Java code's logic."
