    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main part is reading an integer n, then creating two lists: odd and even. It fills these lists with numbers from 1 to n squared, separating odds and evens. Then it processes these lists to print them in a certain pattern. \n\nFirst, in Fortran, I'll need to handle input and output. The Java code uses Scanner and PrintWriter, so in Fortran, I'll use READ(*,*) to get input and WRITE statements for output. \n\nThe variables: n is read from input. square is n*n. Then loop is square divided by n, which simplifies to n again since square is n\u00b2. Wait, square /n is n. So loop is n. Then div is loop/2, which is n/2. But if n is even or odd, div might be integer division. Let me check. In Java, since all variables are int, div would be loop divided by 2, integer division. So in Fortran, when we do integer division, we use / but need to make sure it's integer variables.\n\nNext, the Java code has two ArrayLists, odd and even. In Fortran, we can use arrays or maybe dynamic arrays. But Fortran's arrays are static by default, but there's allocatable arrays. But since the size is known (square has n\u00b2 elements, split into odds and evens), perhaps we can precompute the size. Let's calculate how many odds and evens there are. For example, if n\u00b2 is even, then exactly half each. But if n\u00b2 is odd, then one more in odd. Wait, n can be any integer. For example, n=3: square is 9. So 5 odds and 4 evens. So the odd and even lists can have different sizes. \n\nBut the way the Java code works is that for each loop iteration (loop is n), it does div times (div is n/2) a pair of elements. For example, when i is odd (like 1,3,5...), it takes the first element from odd and the last from even. Then removes those elements. Similarly when i is even, takes first even and last odd. \n\nSo in Fortran, since we can't dynamically remove elements from arrays like ArrayLists, maybe we can track indices. For example, have two arrays for odd and even numbers, and keep track of current positions for the front and back. \n\nLet me think. Let's precompute the odd and even numbers. For example, fill the odd array with all odd numbers from 1 to square, and even array with even numbers. Then, for each row (loop from 1 to n), we need to print div pairs. For each pair, when the row is odd (i%2==1), take the first element from odd (using a front pointer) and the last element from even (using a back pointer). Then increment front and decrement back. For even rows, take front of even and back of odd. \n\nBut wait, the original Java code removes the elements from the lists. So for example, in the first iteration (i=1, which is odd), for each j in 0 to div-1, it removes the first element of odd (using remove(0)), and the last element of even (remove(even.size()-1)). So the next time, the lists are smaller. \n\nBut in Fortran, since arrays are static, perhaps the approach is to precompute the order in which the elements are accessed. Alternatively, track indices for the current front and back of each array. \n\nLet's break it down. Let's say we have odd and even arrays. For the first row (i=1, odd), each pair is (odd[front_odd], even[back_even]). Then front_odd increases by 1, back_even decreases by 1. For the next row (i=2, even), each pair is (even[front_even], odd[back_odd]). Then front_even increases, back_odd decreases. \n\nSo we need four pointers: front_odd, back_odd (for the current start and end of the odd array), front_even, back_even. Wait, but the even array is being used from the end when the row is odd. So for the even array, during odd rows, we take from the end (back_even), and decrement. During even rows, we take from the front (front_even), and increment. Similarly for the odd array: during odd rows, take front_odd and increment; during even rows, take back_odd and decrement. \n\nSo, the initial setup would be:\n\n- Fill the odd array with all odd numbers from 1 to square.\n- Fill the even array with all even numbers from 2 to square.\n- Determine the lengths of odd and even arrays: len_odd and len_even.\n- Then, for each row i from 1 to n:\n   - if i is odd:\n      - for each j in 1 to div (div is n/2):\n         - take the next element from the front of odd (front_odd) and the next from the end of even (back_even)\n         - increment front_odd, decrement back_even\n   - else:\n      - take from front_even and back_odd\n      - increment front_even, decrement back_odd\n\nBut wait, how many pairs per row? The original code uses div, which is loop/2 (loop is n), so div is n/2. But when n is odd, div would be n//2 (integer division). For example, if n is 3, loop is 3, div is 1. Then each row would have 1 pair (two elements?), but wait, the code in Java's loop j runs from 0 to div-1. Wait, original code for j is in 0..div-1. So for div =1, j runs once. So each row prints 2 elements * div. But 2*div = n. Because div is loop/2 = n/2. So 2 * (n/2) = n. So each row has exactly n elements. Which makes sense, since the square is n^2 elements, and loop is n rows. So per row, n elements.\n\nSo for each row, there are div pairs, each consisting of two elements, totaling 2*div elements. But 2*div would be n (since div = n/2). So that's correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to generate for each row, 2*div elements. For example, when n is even, div is exactly n/2, 2*div is n. For n odd, div is (n-1)/2, and 2*div would be n-1, but wait that's a problem. Wait, original code uses loop = square / n. Wait, square is n^2. So loop is n^2 /n =n. So loop is n, and div is loop/2. So for n=3, loop=3, div=1. So each row has 1 pair, 2 elements. But 3 rows * 2 elements each would be 6 elements, but total elements are 9. That doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, the original code's logic for j in 0..div-1. So when n is 3, loop is 3, div is 1. So each row's loop runs once. Each iteration prints two elements. So per row, 2 elements. 3 rows would give 6 elements. But the total elements in square are 9. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check the original code again.\n\nWait, maybe the code is incorrect? Let's take n=3. square=9. The odd array has 5 elements (1,3,5,7,9), even has 4 (2,4,6,8). loop is 3, div is 1. So for each row i=1 to 3.\n\nFor i=1 (odd), j runs from 0 to 0 (once). So first iteration: take odd.remove(0) which is 1, and even.remove(3) (since even.size() is 4, index 3 is 8). Then even becomes size 3. Then, the next j in i=2 (even) would take even.remove(0)=2 and odd.remove(2) (since odd's size is now 4 (since we removed 1)), so the last element is 9. Wait, but after the first iteration of i=1, odd has 4 elements (3,5,7,9), even has 3 (2,4,6). \n\nThen i=2 is even. j runs once. Take even.remove(0)=2, and odd.remove(3-1=2) (since odd's size is 4, so last index is 3. So 9 is removed. Then odd becomes [3,5,7]. even becomes [4,6].\n\ni=3 is odd again. j=0. Take odd.remove(0)=3, even.remove(1) (even's size is 2, index 1 is 6). So output 3 and 6. Now odd is [5,7], even is [4].\n\nBut now, after three rows, total elements printed are 3 rows * 2 elements =6. But the square is 9. So there's a problem. So perhaps the code is not correct, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, but maybe the code is designed for even n? Or perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and works for even n. Because when n is even, square is even. So the number of odds and evens would be equal. For example, n=2: square=4. 2 odds (1,3) and 2 evens (2,4). loop=2, div=1. Each row has 2 elements. For i=1, take 1 and 4. For i=2, take 2 and 3. So total 4 elements. Which is correct.\n\nBut for n=3, the code would only print 6 elements. Which is 2*3. But the total elements is 9. So this code would not handle odd n correctly. But maybe the problem expects n to be even? Because the code's logic only works when n is even. Or perhaps the code has a bug. However, the user is asking to translate the Java code as-is, so I should replicate the logic, even if it's possibly incorrect.\n\nSo moving forward, the Fortran code should mirror the Java code's logic. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Generate the list of odd and even numbers.\n\n3. For each row in 1..n:\n\n   a. For each j in 1..div:\n\n      i. If row is odd, take the first element of odd and last of even.\n\n      ii. Else, take first even and last odd.\n\n      iii. Remove these elements from the lists.\n\n4. Print each pair, then a newline.\n\nBut in Fortran, since we can't have dynamic arrays that automatically resize, we need to manage indices. So perhaps:\n\n- Precompute all odd and even numbers, store them in arrays.\n\n- Track the current start and end indices for each array.\n\nFor example:\n\nodd_numbers array: contains all odd numbers in order.\n\neven_numbers array: contains all even numbers in order.\n\nInitialize:\n\nodd_front = 1\n\nodd_back = len_odd (number of odd numbers)\n\neven_front = 1\n\neven_back = len_even\n\nThen, for each row i from 1 to n:\n\n   if i is odd:\n\n      for j=1 to div:\n\n          take odd_front element (odd_numbers(odd_front)), then even_back element (even_numbers(even_back)).\n\n          increment odd_front by 1, decrement even_back by 1.\n\n   else:\n\n      for j=1 to div:\n\n          take even_front element (even_numbers(even_front)), then odd_back element (odd_numbers(odd_back)).\n\n          increment even_front by 1, decrement odd_back by 1.\n\nBut how to compute len_odd and len_even? Let's see:\n\nsquare = n * n.\n\nThe number of odds is (square + 1) // 2.\n\nNumber of evens is square // 2.\n\nYes. For example, n=3: square=9, odds (9+1)/2=5, evens 4. Which matches.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can compute:\n\nlen_odd = (square +1)/2\n\nlen_even = square/2\n\nSo first, allocate the odd and even arrays with these lengths, then fill them.\n\nOnce filled, then manage the front and back pointers.\n\nNow, in the original code, when i is odd, for each pair, we take the first of odd and last of even, then remove them. Which in terms of indices is odd_front and even_back, then odd_front increases, even_back decreases.\n\nSimilarly for even rows: even_front and odd_back, increment even_front, decrement odd_back.\n\nSo the Fortran code will need to:\n\nLoop for i from 1 to n:\n\n   if mod(i,2) == 1 (odd):\n\n      loop j from 1 to div:\n\n          write odd_numbers(odd_front) and even_numbers(even_back)\n\n          odd_front = odd_front + 1\n\n          even_back = even_back -1\n\n   else:\n\n      loop j from 1 to div:\n\n          write even_numbers(even_front) and odd_numbers(odd_back)\n\n          even_front = even_front +1\n\n          odd_back = odd_back -1\n\n   write a new line.\n\nBut wait, each j loop writes two elements. So for each j, two numbers. So per row, div*2 elements, which should equal n. Because div is loop /2, loop is n. So div is n/2. If n is even, then div * 2 =n. If n is odd, then n/2 is integer division (since in Java). For example, n=3: div=1. 2 elements per row. 3 rows would give 6 elements, but total is 9. So this suggests that the code is wrong for odd n. But again, the problem says to translate the code as is.\n\nSo proceed with this logic.\n\nNow, in Fortran, variables are statically typed. So let's outline the steps.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nsquare = n * n\n\ncompute len_odd and len_even.\n\nallocate odd_numbers(len_odd), even_numbers(len_even).\n\nfill odd_numbers with 1,3,5,..., up to square (if square is odd) or square-1 (if even). Similarly for even.\n\nThen, set odd_front =1, even_front=1, even_back = len_even, odd_back = len_odd.\n\nThen, loop over each row i from 1 to n:\n\n   if i is odd:\n\n      do j=1 to div:\n\n          write the pair (odd_numbers(odd_front), even_numbers(even_back))\n\n          increment odd_front, decrement even_back.\n\n   else:\n\n      do j=1 to div:\n\n          write the pair (even_numbers(even_front), odd_numbers(odd_back))\n\n          increment even_front, decrement odd_back.\n\n   write a new line.\n\nBut each row must have exactly n elements. Wait, no: each row has div pairs, each pair being two elements. So div *2 elements per row. So n must be even. Because div is n/2. For example, n=4: div=2. 2 pairs per row, 4 elements. For n=5, div=2 (5/2=2.5, but integer division gives 2). So 2*2=4 elements per row. But square is 25. 5 rows would produce 5*4=20 elements. But the total is 25. So there's a problem.\n\nWait, this suggests that the original code is incorrect. But the user wants to translate it as-is. So perhaps the code only works for even n. But the original code doesn't check for that. So the Fortran code should replicate the same logic, even if it's incorrect for odd n.\n\nSo proceeding.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute square = n*n.\n\nCompute len_odd = (square+1)/2, len_even = square/2.\n\nAllocate odd and even arrays.\n\nFill odd array: start from 1, step 2 up to square.\n\nFill even array: start from 2, step 2 up to square.\n\nSet odd_front=1, even_front=1, even_back = len_even, odd_back = len_odd.\n\ndiv = n / 2 (integer division).\n\nLoop i from 1 to n:\n\n   if mod(i,2) ==1:\n\n      loop j=1 to div:\n\n          print odd_numbers(odd_front) and even_numbers(even_back)\n\n          odd_front +=1\n\n          even_back -=1\n\n   else:\n\n      loop j=1 to div:\n\n          print even_numbers(even_front) and odd_numbers(odd_back)\n\n          even_front +=1\n\n          odd_back -=1\n\n   print new line.\n\nBut for each j loop, two numbers are printed. So per line, div*2 numbers. Which equals n only if n is even. Because div is n//2. For even n: n=4, div=2. 2*2=4. For odd n=5: div=2. 2*2=4. But 5 is expected, so each line would have 4 elements, but total lines is 5. 5*4=20 elements, but square is 25. So missing 5 elements. But in the original code, perhaps the lists are being exhausted. But in that case, the code may crash. But perhaps the original code expects n to be even. But the user's code doesn't check that.\n\nBut we need to translate the code as-is. So proceed.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\n- How to handle dynamic arrays? Well, since we can precompute the odd and even arrays, we can allocate them with computed sizes.\n\nSo first, code structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_334_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, square, len_odd, len_even, div, i, j\n    integer, allocatable :: odd(:), even(:)\n    integer :: odd_front, even_front, even_back, odd_back\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    square = n * n\n    len_odd = (square + 1) / 2\n    len_even = square / 2\n    allocate(odd(len_odd), even(len_even))\n\n    ! Fill odd array\n    do i = 1, len_odd\n        odd(i) = 2 * i - 1\n    end do\n\n    ! Fill even array\n    do i = 1, len_even\n        even(i) = 2 * i\n    end do\n\n    div = n / 2\n    odd_front = 1\n    even_front = 1\n    even_back = len_even\n    odd_back = len_odd\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        do j = 1, div\n            if (mod(i, 2) == 1) then\n                write(*, '(I0, \" \", I0, \" \")', advance='no') odd(odd_front), even(even_back)\n                odd_front = odd_front + 1\n                even_back = even_back - 1\n            else\n                write(*, '(I0, \" \", I0, \" \")', advance='no') even(even_front), odd(odd_back)\n                even_front = even_front + 1\n                odd_back = odd_back - 1\n            end if\n        end do\n        write(*,*)  ! New line\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(odd, even)\nend program codeforces_334_A\n\nWait, but in the original code, the print statement for each pair appends a space. For example, pw.print(odd.remove(0) + \" \" + even.remove(...) + \" \"). So each pair is printed as \"a b \", then after div pairs, a newline is printed.\n\nIn Fortran, when using non-advancing output, we can accumulate the line. But for simplicity, perhaps use a character buffer to build each line, then print it. But that can be complicated. Alternatively, for each element, print it with space, but Fortran's write statements can handle this.\n\nBut in the code above, for each j, the write statement uses 'advance='no'' so that subsequent writes are on the same line. However, after writing the pair (two elements), a space is added. Wait, the format string is '(I0, \" \", I0, \" \")' which for each pair writes \"x y \" (including the trailing space). So after div pairs, each line ends with a space and a new line. But the original code uses pw.println() which appends a new line. So the Fortran code, after each line's j loop, writes a new line. But the last space might be present. However, the original Java code also appends a space after the last element of the line, which may not be desired. But the user's code does that. So the Fortran code replicates that.\n\nBut when n is even, each line has exactly n elements. For example, n=2: each line has 2 pairs (div=1), each pair is two elements. So two elements per line. Wait, no: for n=2, loop=2, div=1. So each line has 2 elements. Wait, no. For each j loop, two elements. So j runs once. So two elements per line. But n is 2, so the line should have two elements, which matches. So the code is okay.\n\nBut for n=3, each line has two elements. So three lines would have 6 elements, but the square is 9. So 3 elements remain. But according to the code, after processing all lines, these elements are not printed. So the code is incomplete. But again, the original code is being followed.\n\nAnother thing: in the original code, when i is odd, it prints odd.remove(0) and even.remove(even.size()-1). Then those elements are removed. So in the Fortran code, the pointers are incremented and decremented accordingly.\n\nNow, possible edge cases. For example, when even_back becomes 0, but the code may try to access even(0), which is invalid. But in the original code, the loop runs for div times. So in Fortran, if the pointers go out of bounds, it will crash. So this suggests that the code may have bugs for odd n, but since the user's code is as is, we proceed.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran's integer division uses /, but for positive numbers, it truncates towards zero. Java's integer division also truncates towards zero. So div =n/2 in Fortran is same as in Java.\n\nTesting the code for n=2:\n\nExpected output:\n\n1 4 \n2 3 \n\nWhich would produce:\n\n1 4 \n2 3 \n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: n=1. Then square=1. len_odd=1, len_even=0. But even array is size 0. Then, when i=1 (div=0, since n/2 is 0), the j loop runs 0 times. So nothing is printed. But the code may crash because even_back is len_even=0. But j loop is from 1 to div (0), which is 1 to 0: which is not executed. So no problem. So the code would print a new line with no elements. But the original code would have square=1, loop=1, div=0. The j loop runs from 0 to div-1=-1. So the loop is not executed. Then, pw.println() prints a new line. So the output is an empty line. But in reality, the code should output the 1. But perhaps n=1 is invalid input. But again, the code is translated as-is.\n\nSo in Fortran, for n=1, the code would have len_odd=1, even array of size 0. Then, when i=1, j runs from 1 to 0 (div=0), so the loop is skipped. So nothing is printed except a new line. Which is same as the Java code.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the translated Fortran code should be as above."
