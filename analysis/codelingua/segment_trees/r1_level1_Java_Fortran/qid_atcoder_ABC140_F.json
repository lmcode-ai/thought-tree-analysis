    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, Fortran is a bit different, so I need to think about how to handle things like arrays, loops, and sorting. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nThe Java code reads an integer N, then creates a size of 2^N. It reads size integers into an array S, sorts them. Then there's a list called active, which starts with the largest element (since S is sorted and we take the last element). The main loop runs N times, each time sorting the active list in reverse order, then for each element in active, it finds the largest possible element in S that's smaller than the current active element and hasn't been used yet (spawned). If it can't find such an element, it outputs \"No\". Otherwise, adds those elements to activated and then to active. After N iterations, if everything works, outputs \"Yes\".\n\nSo the key steps are: reading and sorting the array, managing the active elements, and for each step, checking the S array in reverse order (since it's sorted) to find unused elements smaller than the current active ones.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about data structures. In Java, they use a boolean array 'spawned' to track used elements. In Fortran, we can have a logical array for that.\n\nFirst, reading N and computing size as 2^N. Then reading size elements into S, sorting them. Fortran has a sort function, but I need to make sure it's sorted in ascending order. The Java code sorts S in ascending order, then uses them in reverse order (since the first element in active is S[size-1], which is the largest).\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in Java they are 0-based. So when translating, need to adjust indices. For example, in Java, the last element is S[size-1], which would be S(size) in Fortran if using 1-based indexing.\n\nWait, but in Java, the array is from 0 to size-1. So when converted to Fortran, if we make S an array of size 'size', then in Fortran, the indices would be 1 to size. So the largest element is S(size), then S(size-1), etc.\n\nSo the initial active list in Java is S[size-1], which in Fortran would be S(size). Then, the spawned array in Java is size elements, with spawned[size-1] set to true. In Fortran, that would be spawned(size) = .true.\n\nThen, the loop runs N times. Each iteration, the active list is sorted in reverse order (so descending), but in Java, they sort it in reverse each time. Then for each element in active, the code looks for the next element in S (starting from the end) that is smaller and not spawned.\n\nIn Fortran, lists are a bit more tricky. Java uses ArrayList, which can dynamically add elements. In Fortran, we can use allocatable arrays and manage their size by reallocating. Alternatively, since the maximum possible size of active can be calculated (each iteration doubles the active list?), but perhaps using an array that can be extended as needed.\n\nWait, in Java, active starts with one element. Then, in each of the N iterations, for each element in active, they add one activated element. So after the first iteration, active has 2 elements (original plus the one added), then next iteration adds 2 more, making 4, etc. So after N iterations, active would have 2^N elements, which is the size variable.\n\nSo, in Fortran, perhaps using an array to represent active, which can be dynamically resized. Each time, we process all elements in active (which is a certain length), and for each, we add one element to activated, then append all of activated to active.\n\nBut in Fortran, handling dynamic arrays requires some work. Let's think: in Java, active is a list that's added to. In Fortran, maybe we can have two arrays: active and activated. Each iteration, we process active, generate activated, then merge them into the new active.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a list-like structure with a maximum possible size, since the maximum possible size of active after N steps is 2^N, which is the size variable. So perhaps pre-allocating an array of size 'size' for active, tracking its current length.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N, compute size = 2^N.\n2. Allocate S(size), read all elements, sort them in ascending order.\n3. Allocate spawned(size), initialized to .false. Then set spawned(size) = .true. (since Java's spawned[size-1] is the last element, which in Fortran is S(size)).\n4. Initialize active array with S(size).\n5. For i from 1 to N:\n   a. Sort active in descending order. Wait, but the Java code sorts active in reverse order each time. So the first step is to sort the active list in reverse (descending) order. So in Fortran, we can sort the active array and then reverse it, or perhaps use a custom sort.\n   b. For each element in the current active list:\n      i. Find the largest possible element in S that is smaller than the current slime and not spawned.\n      ii. To find this, start from the end of S (S(size), S(size-1), etc.), but in Fortran, the array is sorted in ascending order. Wait, Java sorts S in ascending order. So the largest element is S[size-1] in Java, which is S(size) in Fortran. Then, when searching for next elements, in Java they start from next = size-1 and decrement. So in Fortran, start from next = size and decrement by 1 each time.\n\nWait, S is sorted in ascending order in Java (so S[0] is smallest, S[size-1] is largest). Then in Fortran, after sorting S in ascending order, the elements are S(1) smallest, S(size) largest. So the Java code's next variable starts at size-1 (equivalent to Fortran's S(size)), then decrements. So in Fortran, the next variable starts at size, then decreases by 1 each step.\n\nSo for each slime in active, we need to find the largest S element that is smaller than slime and not spawned. So in S, which is sorted in ascending order, we need to find the first element (starting from the end) that is smaller than slime and not spawned.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S is sorted in ascending order. So when looking for an element smaller than slime, the candidate elements are those before the slime's position. But in the Java code, after sorting S in ascending order, the code takes the last element (largest) as the first active element. Then, during each iteration, for each element in active, they look for the next element in S (starting from the end and moving left) that is smaller than the current slime and not yet spawned.\n\nSo in Fortran, after sorting S in ascending order, the largest element is S(size). The next element to look for would start from S(size-1), then size-2, etc. But since spawned is tracked, the code needs to loop from next (initially size) down to 1, checking if S(next) is less than slime and spawned(next) is false.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Java's S is sorted ascending. The code processes the active list, which starts with the largest element (S[size-1] in Java, S(size) in Fortran). For each element in active, they look for the next element in S that is smaller than the current slime and not spawned. The next variable starts at size-1 (Java) which is S(size) in Fortran. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with indices.\n\nIn Java, the array S has size 'size', which is 2^N. After sorting in ascending order, S[0] is the smallest, S[size-1] is largest. The code initializes spawned[size-1] as true, which is the largest element. So in Fortran, S is size elements, sorted in ascending order. So S(1) is smallest, S(size) is largest. The spawned array in Fortran has size elements, and spawned(size) is set to .true. at the start.\n\nThen, for each slime in active, the code needs to find the largest possible element in S that is smaller than slime and not spawned. The next variable in Java starts at size-1 (so S[size-1] in Java, which is the same as S(size) in Fortran if we are using 1-based) and then decrements. Wait, no: in Java, next starts at size-1, which is the index of the largest element. But since spawned[size-1] is already true, the loop in Java first decrements next to find the next available element.\n\nWait, the Java code's initial spawned array has spawned[size-1] set to true. Then, when they process each active element (which starts with S[size-1]), the next variable starts at size-1. The loop in Java's code is:\n\nwhile (next >=0 && (S[next] >= slime || spawned[next])) { next--; }\n\nSo in the first iteration, next is size-1, S[next] is the largest element (same as slime, which is the active element), and spawned[next] is true. So the loop decrements next. So the next variable is looking for the first element in S that is smaller than slime and not spawned.\n\nSo in Fortran, the equivalent would be next starting at size (since that's the largest element), but since spawned(size) is already true, the loop would check if S(next) >= slime OR spawned(next) is true, then decrement next. Wait, but S is sorted in ascending order, so the largest elements are at the end. So in Fortran, the loop would start at next = size and move down to 1.\n\nSo for each slime in active, the code starts at next = size, and while next >=1, check if S(next) >= slime (since S is sorted ascending, elements from next to 1 may have values >= slime if next is higher than the index of slime). Wait, no. Since S is sorted in ascending order, if slime is in active (which is part of S), then any element after its index is larger. So when looking for elements smaller than slime, we need to look at elements before the index where slime is located.\n\nBut how is the active list handled? The active list is a list of elements from S, sorted in reverse order each time. So during the iteration, when processing each slime (which is an element in active), we need to find the next element in S (from the end) that is smaller than slime and not spawned.\n\nWait, perhaps the next variable in Fortran starts at size, and steps down. For each slime, find the first S(next) that is less than slime and not spawned. So:\n\nnext = size\ndo while (next >=1 .and. (S(next) >= slime .or. spawned(next)))\n   next = next -1\nend do\n\nIf next becomes 0 (but Fortran arrays start at 1?), so if next <1, then it's impossible. Then output \"No\".\n\nSo for each slime in active, we search from the end of S backwards until we find an element smaller than slime and not spawned. If found, mark spawned(next) as .true. and add S(next) to activated.\n\nSo, the key parts are:\n\n- Handling dynamic arrays for active and activated. Since in each iteration, the size of active can grow, perhaps using an allocatable array and reallocating when needed.\n\nBut how to manage the active list in Fortran? Let's think of it as a list that starts with a certain length, then each iteration adds activated elements.\n\nIn Java, active is an ArrayList, and in each iteration, activated is a new ArrayList. For each slime in active, activated adds one element. Then, active adds all elements of activated. So after each iteration, active's size doubles (if all elements found a new activated element).\n\nWait, in the first iteration (i=0), active has 1 element. Then, for each of those, activated adds 1 element. So active becomes 2 elements. Next iteration (i=1), process those 2 elements, add 2 elements, active becomes 4, etc. So after N iterations, active has 2^N elements.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can manage two arrays: active and activated. Each iteration, process the current active elements, generate activated elements, then merge them into active.\n\nAlternatively, use a single array for active, which is expanded as needed.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be handled by using allocatable arrays and reallocating. For example:\n\nInitialize active as an array with one element, S(size).\n\nFor each iteration from 1 to N:\n\n   Sort active in descending order (since Java sorts active in reverse order each time)\n\n   Allocate activated array with initial size 0.\n\n   next = size\n\n   For each slime in active:\n\n      find the next element in S that is < slime and not spawned.\n\n      if not found, output 'No' and stop.\n\n      mark spawned(next) as .true.\n\n      add S(next) to activated.\n\n   Then, append activated to active.\n\nBut how to append arrays in Fortran. Let's see.\n\nIf active is an array, and after processing each slime, we collect activated elements into an array, then active becomes active + activated.\n\nIn Fortran, you can do:\n\nactive = [active, activated]\n\nBut this requires that active and activated are 1D arrays, and the concatenation is allowed in Fortran 2003 and later. So assuming that, this can work.\n\nBut each time, the active array is reallocated and copied. For performance, but given the problem constraints, it's manageable.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead N.\n\nCompute size = 2**N.\n\nRead S array of size elements.\n\nSort S in ascending order.\n\nInitialize spawned as logical array of size elements, all .false. except spawned(size) = .true.\n\nInitialize active as [S(size)]\n\nLoop for i = 1 to N:\n\n   Sort active in descending order.\n\n   Initialize activated as empty array.\n\n   next = size\n\n   do for each slime in active:\n\n      find next: the largest index where S(next) < slime and .not. spawned(next)\n\n      while next >=1 and (S(next) >= slime .or. spawned(next)):\n\n          next = next -1\n\n      if next <1: print 'No' and exit.\n\n      spawned(next) = .true.\n\n      append S(next) to activated.\n\n   end do\n\n   append activated to active.\n\nend loop\n\nAfter all iterations, print 'Yes'.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the sort in descending order, and the dynamic arrays.\n\nIn Fortran, the intrinsic sort functions may not directly support sorting in descending order. So perhaps sort in ascending and then reverse.\n\nFor example:\n\ncall sort(active)  ! sorts in ascending order\n\nactive = active(size(active):1:-1  ! reverses the array\n\nWait, but the active array's size could be variable. For example, if active has m elements, active(m:1:-1) would reverse it.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to reverse an array, you can do active = active(size(active):1:-1).\n\nBut for this, the array must be 1D.\n\nSo in each iteration, after processing, we sort active in ascending order and then reverse it to get descending.\n\nAlternatively, use a custom sorting function. But using the intrinsic sort and then reversing is easier.\n\nNow, for the dynamic arrays:\n\nIn Fortran, you can have allocatable arrays. For example:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: active(:), activated(:)\n\nThen, during the loop:\n\nactivated = [ integer :: ]  ! empty array\n\nBut how to dynamically add elements. For example, when a new element is found, append it to activated.\n\nIn Fortran, you can do:\n\nactivated = [activated, s(next)]\n\nBut each time this creates a new array, which may be inefficient but manageable for small sizes.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the Java code, the active list is sorted in reverse order before processing each iteration. This is important because the order in which the elements are processed affects the selection of S elements. For example, the largest active elements are processed first, selecting the next largest available S elements.\n\nIn the Fortran code, after each iteration, we need to sort active in descending order before processing the next iteration.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC140_F\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, size_val, i, j, k, next_idx, slime, m\n    integer, allocatable :: S(:), active(:), activated(:)\n    logical, allocatable :: spawned(:)\n    logical :: found\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) N\n    size_val = 2 ** N\n    allocate(S(size_val))\n    do i = 1, size_val\n        read(*,*) S(i)\n    end do\n\n    ! Sort S in ascending order\n    call sort(S)\n\n    allocate(spawned(size_val))\n    spawned = .false.\n    spawned(size_val) = .true.  ! Mark the largest element as spawned\n\n    ! Initialize active with the largest element\n    allocate(active(1))\n    active(1) = S(size_val)\n\n    ! Main loop for N iterations\n    do i = 1, N\n        ! Sort active in descending order\n        call sort(active)\n        active = active(size(active):1:-1)\n\n        ! Prepare activated list\n        activated = [ integer :: ]\n\n        next_idx = size_val\n\n        ! Process each slime in active\n        do j = 1, size(active)\n            slime = active(j)\n\n            ! Find the next element in S that is smaller than slime and not spawned\n            found = .false.\n            do while (next_idx >= 1)\n                if (.not. spawned(next_idx) .and. S(next_idx) < slime) then\n                    found = .true.\n                    exit\n                else\n                    next_idx = next_idx - 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (.not. found) then\n                print *, 'No'\n                stop\n            end if\n\n            spawned(next_idx) = .true.\n            activated = [activated, S(next_idx)]\n        end do\n\n        ! Append activated to active\n        active = [active, activated]\n    end do\n\n    print *, 'Yes'\n\ncontains\n\n    ! Subroutine to sort an integer array (using a simple bubble sort for example)\n    ! Note: For better performance, replace with a more efficient sort\n    subroutine sort(arr)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer :: temp, i, j\n        do i = size(arr), 1, -1\n            do j = 1, i-1\n                if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n                    temp = arr(j)\n                    arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n                    arr(j+1) = temp\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end subroutine sort\n\nend program atcoder_ABC140_F\n\nWait, but this uses a bubble sort which is O(n^2). For larger N (like N=20, size=1e6), this would be too slow. However, in the original Java code, they use Arrays.sort which is O(n log n). So perhaps in Fortran, using an efficient sort is better.\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function. So perhaps implement a quick sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function from a library. But since Fortran standards don't include a sort function, we need to implement one.\n\nSo, replacing the bubble sort with a quick sort implementation.\n\nAlternatively, in this case, since the active array's size starts small and grows exponentially (each iteration doubles the size), perhaps even bubble sort is manageable, but for N up to 20, the active array can be up to 2^20 elements, which is 1e6. Bubble sort on 1e6 elements is O(1e12), which is impossible.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the active list is sorted each iteration. For N=20, there are 20 iterations. The active array starts at size 1, then 2, 4, 8, etc. So the total sum of the squares for sorting is sum_{k=0 to 19} (2^k)^2 = sum 4^k from 0 to 19 = (4^20 -1)/3 \u2248 1e12, which is way too big.\n\nSo bubble sort is not feasible. Need a more efficient sorting algorithm.\n\nThus, implementing a quicksort or merge sort for the active array.\n\nSo modifying the sort subroutine to use a more efficient algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran 2008 intrinsic function, but I'm not sure if that's available. Assuming that the user's Fortran compiler has no such function, we need to implement an efficient sort.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of quicksort for integer arrays.\n\nBut writing a quicksort in Fortran can be done recursively or iteratively. However, Fortran's recursion support can be limited, especially for older compilers. So perhaps implementing an iterative version.\n\nAlternatively, use merge sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran pack function with masks to split the array.\n\nBut for the purposes of this code, perhaps we can use a simple quicksort.\n\nAlternatively, since the active array needs to be sorted in ascending order and then reversed, perhaps we can sort in ascending and then reverse.\n\nHere's an implementation of a quicksort for integers.\n\nBut perhaps for brevity, using a simple quicksort implementation.\n\nAlternatively, find an existing Fortran quicksort code.\n\nFor example:\n\nrecursive subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n    integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n    if (low < high) then\n        pivot = arr(high)\n        i = low - 1\n        do j = low, high-1\n            if (arr(j) <= pivot) then\n                i = i + 1\n                temp = arr(i)\n                arr(i) = arr(j)\n                arr(j) = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n        temp = arr(i+1)\n        arr(i+1) = arr(high)\n        arr(high) = temp\n\n        call quicksort(arr, low, i)\n        call quicksort(arr, i+2, high)\n    end if\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nsubroutine sort(arr)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    if (size(arr) > 1) then\n        call quicksort(arr, 1, size(arr))\n    end if\nend subroutine sort\n\nBut this uses recursion, which may hit stack limits for large arrays. Alternatively, implement an iterative quicksort.\n\nBut for the purposes of this code, perhaps the recursive version is acceptable for the problem's constraints.\n\nBut given that N can be up to, say, 20, the active array can be up to 2^20 elements. For N=20, each iteration's active array is 2^i elements. So the largest active array is 2^20 = 1e6 elements. Sorting that with quicksort would be manageable.\n\nBut the problem is that each iteration requires sorting the active array. So for 1e6 elements, quicksort is O(n log n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, replacing the bubble sort with a quicksort.\n\nSo the sort subroutine would be as above.\n\nBut in Fortran, the recursive subroutine requires the subroutine to be declared as recursive.\n\nSo the modified code would have:\n\nrecursive subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n    integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n    if (low < high) then\n        pivot = arr(high)\n        i = low - 1\n        do j = low, high-1\n            if (arr(j) <= pivot) then\n                i = i + 1\n                temp = arr(i)\n                arr(i) = arr(j)\n                arr(j) = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n        temp = arr(i+1)\n        arr(i+1) = arr(high)\n        arr(high) = temp\n\n        call quicksort(arr, low, i)\n        call quicksort(arr, i+2, high)\n    end if\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nsubroutine sort(arr)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    if (size(arr) > 1) then\n        call quicksort(arr, 1, size(arr))\n    end if\nend subroutine sort\n\nThis should work.\n\nAnother point: in the Fortran code, the 'spawned' array is initialized with spawned(size_val) = .true. Then, for the first active element (S(size_val)), the code's first iteration starts by processing that element.\n\nBut in the Java code, after initializing active with S[size-1], which is the largest element, spawned[size-1] is set to true.\n\nSo in Fortran, this is correctly handled.\n\nNow, another potential issue: the 'next_idx' starts at size_val for each slime in active. But for each slime, we need to search from the end of S (size_val) downwards. However, in the Fortran code, the next_idx is shared between all slime elements. So for example, after processing the first slime, next_idx may be 100, and then when processing the next slime, next_idx starts at 100. This is different from the Java code, where for each slime, the next variable starts at size-1 again.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor (int slime : active) {\n    int next = size - 1;\n    while (next >=0 && (S[next] >= slime || spawned[next])) {\n        next--;\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nSo for each slime in active, the next variable starts at size-1 and decrements. So each slime's search starts from the end of the array.\n\nBut in the Fortran code as written, next_idx is initialized to size_val once before processing all slimes. So after processing one slime, next_idx is left at some index, and the next slime's search starts from there, which may be incorrect.\n\nAh, that's a critical error. The Fortran code currently initializes next_idx once per iteration, not per slime. So for example, in the first iteration, active has one element. The next_idx starts at size_val. After processing that slime, next_idx is decremented to some value. But if there are multiple slimes in active (in later iterations), the next_idx would carry over from the previous slime's processing. This is incorrect.\n\nIn Java, for each slime, the next variable starts at size-1. So in Fortran, for each slime in active, the next_idx should start at size_val again.\n\nSo the Fortran code's mistake is initializing next_idx once per iteration, not per slime.\n\nSo the code needs to, for each slime in active, start next_idx at size_val and decrement.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, for each slime in active:\n\nnext_idx = size_val\ndo while (next_idx >=1 .and. (S(next_idx) >= slime .or. spawned(next_idx)))\n    next_idx = next_idx -1\nend do\n\nBut in the current code, next_idx is initialized once before the loop over active elements, leading to the same next_idx being used across all slimes.\n\nThis is a bug. So to fix this, inside the loop over active elements, for each slime, reset next_idx to size_val.\n\nSo in the code:\n\ndo j = 1, size(active)\n    slime = active(j)\n    next_idx = size_val  ! Reset next_idx for each slime\n    found = .false.\n    do while (next_idx >= 1)\n        if (.not. spawned(next_idx) .and. S(next_idx) < slime) then\n            found = .true.\n            exit\n        else\n            next_idx = next_idx -1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (.not. found) then\n        print *, 'No'\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    spawned(next_idx) = .true.\n    activated = [activated, S(next_idx)]\nend do\n\nYes, that's the correct approach.\n\nSo the Fortran code's previous version had next_idx initialized once per iteration, but it should be initialized to size_val for each slime in active.\n\nThat's a crucial correction.\n\nAnother thing: when sorting S, the Fortran code uses call sort(S), which sorts in ascending order. This matches the Java code's Arrays.sort(S), which sorts in ascending order.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is the size of the activated array. In the Fortran code, activated is initialized as an empty array, and for each slime, we append one element. So the activated array's size equals the size of the active array.\n\nThus, after the loop, active becomes active concatenated with activated, doubling its size each iteration (if all elements find a next_idx).\n\nBut the Fortran code should correctly handle this.\n\nAnother possible issue is the allocation and reallocation of activated and active. Since in Fortran, when you assign an array using [ ... ], it automatically manages the allocation. For example:\n\nactivated = [integer :: ]  ! empty array\nactivated = [activated, 5]  ! now has one element\n\nThis should work.\n\nSo putting all these together, the corrected Fortran code should:\n\n- Read N, size = 2^N.\n\n- Read and sort S in ascending order.\n\n- Initialize spawned array.\n\n- Initialize active with the largest element.\n\n- For each of N iterations:\n\n   Sort active in descending order.\n\n   For each slime in active:\n\n      Start next_idx at size_val.\n\n      Find the first S(next_idx) < slime and not spawned.\n\n      Mark it as spawned and add to activated.\n\n   Append activated to active.\n\nNow, the key corrections are:\n\n1. Sorting active in each iteration in descending order.\n\n2. Resetting next_idx to size_val for each slime in active.\n\n3. Using a quicksort instead of bubble sort.\n\nSo the final code should look like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC140_F\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, size_val, i, j, next_idx, slime\n    integer, allocatable :: S(:), active(:), activated(:)\n    logical, allocatable :: spawned(:)\n    logical :: found\n\n    !

Initialize active with the largest element\n    allocate(active(1))\n    active(1) = S(size_val)\n\n    ! Main loop for N iterations\n    do i = 1, N\n        ! Sort active in descending order\n        call sort(active)\n        active = active(size(active):1:-1)\n\n        ! Prepare activated list\n        activated = [ integer :: ]\n\n        !

The key points are handling the dynamic arrays, sorting in descending order, and correctly resetting next_idx for each slime in active.\n\nTesting this code would be necessary to ensure it behaves as expected, but based on the translation logic, this should be correct."
