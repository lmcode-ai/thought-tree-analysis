    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. The program reads an integer n, converts it to binary, counts the number of '1's in that binary representation, and prints the count. So the main steps are: read input, convert to binary as a string, count the '1's, output the count.\n\nFirst, let's think about how Java handles this. The loop divides n by 2 each time, appending the remainder to the string s. Then it iterates through the string to count '1's.\n\nIn Fortran, I can't build a string in the same way. Fortran strings are fixed-length unless using allocatable or other features. But maybe there's a better way. Instead of building a string, perhaps count the '1's directly during the division process. That might be more efficient and avoid string handling, which is a bit more cumbersome in Fortran.\n\nSo, let's plan the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the integer n from standard input.\n2. Initialize a counter for the number of 1's.\n3. Loop while n is greater than 0:\n   a. Get the remainder when n is divided by 2.\n   b. If the remainder is 1, increment the counter.\n   c. Divide n by 2, discarding the remainder (integer division).\n4. After the loop, print the counter.\n\nThis approach skips building the binary string and directly counts the 1's, which should be more straightforward in Fortran. That's probably better since Fortran's string manipulation isn't as flexible as Java's.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code. Fortran programs start with a program block. Need to declare variables: n, ans (counter), maybe a temporary variable for the remainder.\n\nIn Fortran, reading from standard input can be done with read(*,*) n. Then, initialize ans to 0.\n\nIn the loop: while n > 0, compute mod(n, 2). If it's 1, ans = ans + 1. Then set n = n / 2 (integer division in Fortran is automatic when using integers with /, right? Because in Fortran, 5/2 is 2 if both are integers).\n\nWait, but in Java, n /= 2 is integer division, which truncates towards zero. Same in Fortran when dividing two integers. So that part is the same.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, ans, remainder\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    ans = 0\n\n    do while (n > 0)\n        remainder = mod(n, 2)\n        if (remainder == 1) then\n            ans = ans + 1\n        end if\n        n = n / 2\n    end do\n\n    print *, ans\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the original code, the binary digits are generated by taking mod 2 and adding to the string. But since we're counting 1's, there's no need to build the string. So this approach is correct.\n\nTesting with sample input: Let's say n is 5. Binary is 101, which has two 1's. Let's see:\n\nLoop steps:\n\nn starts at 5.\n\nFirst iteration:\nmod(5,2)=1 \u2192 ans becomes 1.\nn becomes 2 (5/2 is 2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2).\n\nSecond iteration:\nmod(2,2)=0 \u2192 ans stays 1.\nn becomes 1.\n\nThird iteration:\nmod(1,2)=1 \u2192 ans becomes 2.\nn becomes 0. Loop ends.\n\nYes, correct. So the code works.\n\nThis should be the correct Fortran translation. So the answer is the Fortran code as written above."
