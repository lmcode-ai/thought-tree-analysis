In the Java code's setParent:\n\npublic void setParent(int K, int parent, int use, Node[] nodes) {\n    this.pattern = K - use;\n    this.parent = parent;\n    int count = 1; if (parent != -1) {\n        count++;\n    }\n    for (int n : children) {\n        if (n == this.parent) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        nodes[n].setParent(K, index, count, nodes);\n        count++;\n    }\n} Wait, when parent is -1 (root node), count starts at 1.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java code seems to be solving a problem where we have a tree structure, and we need to calculate the number of ways to color the nodes with K colors such that adjacent nodes have different colors. The approach here is using a recursive method to set the pattern for each node based on the number of available colors after accounting for parent and already used colors.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure. There's a Node class with a pattern (long), index, children (a LinkedList of Integers), parent (int), and a method setParent. The solve method reads input, builds the tree, initializes nodes, and then computes the product of all node patterns modulo 1e9+7.\n\nFortran doesn't have classes, so I'll need to represent the nodes using derived types. Also, Fortran is not object-oriented, so methods like setParent will have to be converted into subroutines that take the node data structures as arguments.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Represent each node as a derived type. Each node has:\n   - pattern (integer, maybe integer(kind=8) for large numbers)\n   - index (integer)\n   - children (an array or a list, but in Fortran, maybe an allocatable array of integers)\n   - parent (integer)\n\nBut wait, in Java, each node's children are stored as a LinkedList. In Fortran, I can use an allocatable array to hold the children indices. However, dynamically adding elements to a list isn't straightforward. Since the input is read once, maybe during the reading of edges, we can build the children arrays.\n\n2. The main steps in the solve method are:\n   - Read N and K.\n   - Create N nodes.\n   - Read N-1 edges and build the adjacency list (children for each node).\n   - Call setParent on the root node (index 0) with parent -1, use 0.\n   - Multiply all nodes' pattern values modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe setParent method recursively sets the pattern for each node. The pattern for a node is K minus the number of used colors (parent and siblings). Then for each child, the count increments, and they call setParent with the current node as parent and the current count as 'use'.\n\nIn Fortran, recursion is possible, but handling arrays of derived types can be a bit tricky. Since in the Java code, the nodes are stored in an array, perhaps in Fortran, we can have an array of derived types, and pass that array to the recursive subroutine.\n\nBut Fortran's handling of recursive subroutines might vary. Alternatively, since the tree is processed depth-first, perhaps an iterative approach could be used, but translating the recursive approach directly might be easier.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures:\n\n- Each node's children can be stored as an array of integers. Since the size is variable, we can use allocatable arrays. But when building the tree, when adding a child, we need to append to the array. In Fortran, appending requires reallocation. So for each node, when we read an edge, we add the other node to its children, unless it's the parent. Wait, but during the initial building phase (before setting parents), the children are all adjacent nodes, including the parent. Then, during the setParent process, when we process a node's children, we skip the parent.\n\nSo during the initial building, all edges are added to both nodes' children lists. Then, when traversing, we avoid the parent.\n\nIn Fortran, for the children list, each node's children is an array that includes all adjacent nodes, including the parent. Then, during the setParent process, when iterating through children, we check if the child is the parent and skip it.\n\nSo for the derived type:\n\ntype node\n    integer(kind=8) :: pattern\n    integer :: index\n    integer, allocatable :: children(:)\n    integer :: parent = -1\nend type node\n\nBut in Fortran, the derived type can't have default initializers unless using Fortran 2003 features. Maybe using a constructor function. Alternatively, initialize the parent to -1 in the code.\n\nNext, the setParent method:\n\nIn Java, the setParent method of a node takes K, parent, use, and the nodes array. It sets the node's pattern to K - use, then for each child in children (excluding parent), calls setParent with the current node's index as parent, and count as the number of used colors (starts at 1 or 2 depending on parent).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the count starts as 1 if there's a parent (because the parent is already using a color, so when processing the children, the first child will have use = count (which starts at 1 if parent exists, then increments). Let me look again.\n\nIn the Java code's setParent:\n\npublic void setParent(int K, int parent, int use, Node[] nodes) {\n    this.pattern = K - use;\n    this.parent = parent;\n    int count = 1;\n    if (parent != -1) {\n        count++;\n    }\n    for (int n : children) {\n        if (n == this.parent) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        nodes[n].setParent(K, index, count, nodes);\n        count++;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, when parent is -1 (root node), count starts at 1. Because in that case, the root has no parent, so when processing children, the first child's use is count (which is 1). For the root node, the initial 'use' passed is 0. So the root's pattern is K - use (which is K - 0 = K). Then, for each child of the root, count starts at 1. So the first child's pattern is K - 1 (since use is 1), but wait, no: the 'use' passed to the child's setParent is 'count' which starts at 1. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nFor the root node (index 0), the initial call is setParent(K, -1, 0, nodes). The root's pattern is K - 0 = K. Then, count is initialized as 1 (since parent is -1, so the if (parent !=-1) is false, so count starts at 1). Then, for each child in children (excluding parent, which is -1, so all children are processed). For each child n in children (excluding parent, which is -1 here), nodes[n].setParent(K, current index (0), count (1), ...). Then count increments. So the first child gets use=1, next use=2, etc.\n\nWait, but why? Because the root node's count starts at 1. So when the root has, say, two children. The first child's use is 1 (count=1), then count increments to 2. The second child's use is 2. So each child's pattern is K - use, which is K-1 for the first child, K-2 for the second. But why?\n\nBecause when a node has a parent, the number of used colors is the parent's color plus the colors of the siblings that were processed before it. For example, the root has no parent. Its first child uses 1 (because the root's own color is already taken), but for the children of that first child, the count starts higher. Wait, perhaps the 'use' parameter represents the number of colors that are already used (parent and previous siblings). So when a node is being processed, the available colors are K minus the number of used colors (parent and the siblings that were processed before this node). So each child's use is count, which starts at 1 (if no parent) or 2 (if there is a parent). Then, for each subsequent child, count increments by 1 each time.\n\nSo in the code, when a node has a parent, count starts at 2. Because parent is 1, and the count starts at 2 (since parent != -1). Then, for each child, the use is count (starting at 2), then increment count. So for example, if a node has three children and a parent, the first child gets use=2, next use=3, next use=4. So the available colors are K - 2, K-3, K-4, etc. This seems to model that each child must choose a color different from the parent and all previous siblings.\n\nSo the key part is the recursive setting of the patterns based on the parent and the number of siblings processed before.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to model this. So each node's children array includes all adjacent nodes. But when processing, we skip the parent.\n\nSo the steps for the Fortran code:\n\n1. Define a derived type for the node with pattern, index (maybe not needed, since array index can represent it), children (array of integers), parent.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, each node's index is stored, but perhaps in Fortran, the node is stored in an array, and the array index represents the node's index. So perhaps the 'index' field is redundant. Let's check the Java code. The Node constructor takes an int i and sets index to i. Then, when processing children, they are indices. So in Fortran, the nodes can be stored in an array where the index corresponds to the node's identifier (0 to N-1). So the 'index' field may not be necessary. So the Fortran node type can omit the index.\n\nSo the derived type would be:\n\ntype node_type\n    integer(kind=8) :: pattern\n    integer, allocatable :: children(:)\n    integer :: parent = -1\nend type node_type\n\nBut in Fortran, when you have an array of derived types with allocatable components, you need to ensure proper allocation and deallocation. But for this problem, once the children arrays are built, they won't be modified except during the initial setup.\n\n2. Reading the input.\n\nRead N and K. Then read N-1 pairs of a and b (0-based in the Java code after subtracting 1). For each pair, add b to a's children and a to b's children.\n\nIn Fortran, for each node, the children array needs to be dynamically extended. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in list structure, each time a new child is added, we can reallocate the array.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for a node i, when we read an edge a-b (after converting to 0-based), we add b to a's children and a to b's children.\n\nSo for each edge, after reading a and b (converted to 0-based), we can append the child to both nodes' children arrays.\n\nImplementing this in Fortran:\n\nAllocate an array of node_type of size N. Initialize each node's children as an empty array. Then for each edge:\n\nread a and b (0-based). Then:\n\ntemp = nodes(a)%children\nallocate(nodes(a)%children(size(temp)+1))\nnodes(a)%children(1:size(temp)) = temp\nnodes(a)%children(size(temp)+1) = b\ndeallocate(temp)\n\nSame for nodes(b)%children, adding a.\n\nBut this is inefficient, but for the problem's constraints (assuming N is up to 1e5 or similar?), but perhaps manageable.\n\nBut in the Java code, the nodes are 0-based. So in Fortran, the array is 1-based unless we use 0-based indexing. Wait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. But in the Java code, the nodes are 0-based. So when translating, we need to adjust.\n\nWait, in Java, nodes are 0-based (from 0 to N-1). So in Fortran, if we use an array of nodes starting at index 1, then the Java node 0 is Fortran node 1. But that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps use 0-based indexing in Fortran. But Fortran doesn't support 0-based arrays by default. However, you can define the array with indices starting at 0.\n\nSo when declaring the nodes array:\n\ntype(node_type), allocatable :: nodes(:)\nallocate(nodes(0:N-1)) ! If N is given, but wait, N is read from input. So after reading N, allocate nodes(0:N-1).\n\nBut in Fortran, the syntax for allocating with a lower bound is:\n\nallocate(nodes(0:N-1))\n\nBut in Fortran, array indices can start from any integer. So yes, that's possible.\n\nSo for each node index from 0 to N-1, the nodes array is allocated from 0 to N-1.\n\n3. The setParent subroutine.\n\nIn Java, the setParent method is called on a node, passing K, parent, use, and the nodes array. Then, for each child (excluding the parent), recursively call setParent.\n\nIn Fortran, this can be a recursive subroutine that takes the current node index, K, parent, use, and the nodes array.\n\nSo the subroutine would be:\n\nrecursive subroutine set_parent(node_idx, K, parent, use, nodes)\n    integer, intent(in) :: node_idx, K, parent, use\n    type(node_type), intent(inout) :: nodes(0:)\n    integer :: count, i, child\n    ! Set the current node's pattern and parent\n    nodes(node_idx)%pattern = K - use\n    nodes(node_idx)%parent = parent\n\n    ! Determine the initial count\n    count = 1\n    if (parent /= -1) then\n        count = 2\n    end if\n\n    ! Iterate through children, excluding the parent\n    do i = 1, size(nodes(node_idx)%children)\n        child = nodes(node_idx)%children(i)\n        if (child == parent) cycle\n        call set_parent(child, K, node_idx, count, nodes)\n        count = count + 1\n    end do\nend subroutine set_parent\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the count starts at 1 if parent is -1 (root node), else starts at 2. Then, for each child (excluding parent), the use is count, then count increments.\n\nYes. So in the Fortran code, after setting the current node's pattern and parent, initialize count as 1, then if parent is not -1, add 1 to count (so count becomes 2). Then for each child in the current node's children list, if the child is the parent, skip. Otherwise, call set_parent on the child with use=count, then increment count.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n4. The main program:\n\nRead N and K, allocate nodes(0:N-1). For each node, initialize children as an empty array. Then read N-1 edges, adding to each node's children. Then call set_parent on node 0 (the root) with parent=-1 and use=0. Then compute the product of all nodes' pattern modulo 1e9+7.\n\nIn Fortran, the main steps would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, K, i, a, b, j\n    type(node_type), allocatable :: nodes(:)\n    integer(kind=8) :: result\n    integer, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\n    read(*,*) N, K\n\n    allocate(nodes(0:N-1))\n    do i = 0, N-1\n        nodes(i)%parent = -1\n        nodes(i)%pattern = 0\n        allocate(nodes(i)%children(0)) !

Then, for each edge, we append the child. The append_child subroutine takes a node and a child index and appends it to the node's children array.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you have an array that's allocated with size 0, then when you append, it's size increases by one each time.\n\nBut the way I wrote the append_child is creating a temp array, copying the existing elements, adding the new child, then moving the allocation back to the node's children.\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, let's check the indices:\n\nIn the main loop reading edges, a and b are converted from 1-based to 0-based (since Java code uses 0-based indices for nodes). So in the input, edges are given as 1-based, converted to 0-based.\n\nFor example, if the input is 2 3, Java code subtracts 1 to get 1 and 2, but in the Fortran code, we read a and b as integers, subtract 1 to make them 0-based.\n\nThen, when building the children arrays, each node's children are stored as 0-based indices.\n\nThe set_parent subroutine starts with node_idx=0 (the root node), parent=-1, use=0.\n\nThen, for each child of the root node, count starts at 1 (since parent is -1). So the first child's use is 1. Then count increments to 2, next child uses 2, etc.\n\nThe product is computed by multiplying all nodes' pattern values modulo MOD (1e9+7).\n\nBut what about the data types? The Java code uses long for pattern, which is 64-bit integer. In Fortran, integer(kind=8) is equivalent. So the result variable and the pattern fields should be integer(kind=8).\n\nBut in the code above, the result is declared as integer(kind=8), and the nodes' pattern is also integer(kind=8). The MOD is an integer, but when multiplied with a 64-bit integer, the result is 64-bit. So that's correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In Fortran, the nodes array is passed to the recursive subroutine. Since Fortran passes arrays by reference, this should work.\n\n- Handling the recursive calls: Fortran allows recursive subroutines as long as they are declared with the 'recursive' keyword.\n\n- The initial children array for each node is allocated with size 0 (empty). Then, edges are processed by appending to the children arrays.\n\nTesting:\n\nFor example, let's consider N=3, K=3.\n\nEdges:\n\n1-2, 1-3.\n\nIn Java, after subtracting 1, the edges are 0-1, 0-2.\n\nSo nodes[0] has children [1, 2], nodes[1] has [0], nodes[2] has [0].\n\nsetParent is called on 0 with parent -1, use 0. So nodes[0].pattern = 3-0=3.\n\nThen, for each child in 0's children (1 and 2), count starts at 1 (parent is -1). For child 1:\n\ncall set_parent(1, K=3, parent=0, use=1). nodes[1].pattern = 3-1=2.\n\nThen, in processing node 1's children (0 is the parent, so cycle. So no further calls. Then count increments to 2.\n\nThen, next child is 2. call set_parent(2, K=3, parent=0, use=2). nodes[2].pattern = 3-2=1.\n\nMultiply all patterns: 3 * 2 * 1 =6. Which is 6 mod 1e9+7 is 6.\n\nSo the output is 6.\n\nIn Fortran, this should compute the same.\n\nAnother test case: when N=1. Then K is given. But N=1, no edges. Then nodes[0].pattern is K - use (use=0) = K. So output K mod MOD. But according to the problem statement, perhaps N=1 is allowed. The code handles that.\n\nPotential issues in Fortran code:\n\n- The children arrays are 1-based in the loop in set_parent. For example, in the do i=1, size(nodes(node_idx)%children). Because in the append_child subroutine, the arrays are 1-based? Wait, no. Because when we allocate a new array as size s+1, and assign temp(1:s) = n%children, which was of size s, then temp(s+1) = child.\n\nSo the children arrays are 1-based? No. When you allocate an array with size(s+1), the indices are 1 to s+1. Because in Fortran, unless specified, arrays start at 1. Wait, no: if you allocate an array with allocate(arr(n)), the default lower bound is 1. So in the code above, when we allocate temp(s+1), temp is from 1 to s+1. Then, temp(1:s) copies the existing elements (from 1 to s) and temp(s+1) is the new element.\n\nSo the children arrays are 1-based. So in the do loop in set_parent, i runs from 1 to size(n%children), which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the initial allocation of nodes(i)%children(0). Wait, in Fortran, an array of size 0 is allowed. So allocate(nodes(i)%children(0)) creates an array of size 0. Then, when appending, the first element is added as index 1. So the first child is at index 1, and so on.\n\nThus, in the loop in set_parent, do i=1, size(children), which is correct.\n\nAnother possible problem: integer division or overflow. Since the product is computed as (result * pattern) mod MOD, and in Fortran, the multiplication of two integers (even 64-bit) could overflow if MOD is 1e9+7 and N is up to 1e5. Because 1e9+7 squared is about 1e18+..., which is within the 64-bit integer limit (approx 9e18). But when N is up to 1e5, and each pattern is up to K (which can be 1e9), the product could be (1e9)^1e5, which is way beyond 64-bit. So modulo at each step is necessary. The code does that correctly.\n\nAnother thing: in the Java code, the initial use is 0 for the root node. So its pattern is K. Then, for each child of the root, use starts at 1. So the first child's pattern is K-1, the next K-2, etc. But if K is less than the number of children, the pattern would be negative, leading to a negative product. But the problem probably ensures that K is sufficient. However, the code handles this by taking modulo 1e9+7, which may result in negative numbers. However, modulo operation in Fortran returns a remainder with the same sign as the dividend. So for negative numbers, adding MOD and then taking modulo again ensures a positive result. But in the given code, perhaps the patterns are positive, but if not, the code may need to adjust. However, the original Java code uses modulo 1e9+7, which could allow negative values if patterns are negative, but the problem statement likely ensures that K is sufficiently large. So the Fortran code may need to handle this, but the original Java code doesn't, so perhaps it's not necessary.\n\nTesting another case: N=2, K=2. Edges: 1-2. So nodes 0 and 1. Root is 0. Processing:\n\nnodes[0].pattern = 2 - 0 =2.\n\nChildren of 0 is 1. count starts at 1. So call set_parent on 1, parent=0, use=1.\n\nnodes[1].pattern = 2 -1=1.\n\nThen product is 2*1=2.\n\nWhich is correct: root has 2 choices, child has 1 (can't be same as root).\n\nSo the code handles this.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be correct."
