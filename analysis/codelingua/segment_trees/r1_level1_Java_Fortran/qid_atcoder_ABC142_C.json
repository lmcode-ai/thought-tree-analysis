Then create a structure that maps each integer (A) to its position (i). But Fortran doesn't have built-in hash maps. So since the keys are integers from 1 to N, and each is unique (since the problem is similar to arranging in order, I assume that the A's are a permutation of 1 to N). So in that case, we can use an array where the index is the A value, and the value stored is the original position. So for example, if A=3, then the array at index 3 will store i=1 (assuming that's the first element). So in Fortran, we can declare an integer array, say, idorder, of size",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at the original code first.\n\nThe Java code reads an integer N, then reads N integers. It maps each integer to its position (i from 1 to N), then prints the values in order from 1 to N based on the stored positions. So for example, if the input is 3 and the numbers are 3 1 2, the map would have 3\u21921, 1\u21922, 2\u21923. Then it prints the values for keys 1,2,3 which are 2,3,1, but wait, no. Wait, the keys in the map are the A values, and the values in the map are their original positions. Then when iterating from i=1 to N, it gets the value (original position) for each A=i. So the output is the original positions sorted by the A values. Oh right, because the A values represent the desired order. For example, if the input is N=3, and the A's are 3,1,2, that means the first student's desired position is 3, the second's is 1, the third's is 2. So the output should list the original indices in the order of their A's. So the output would be 2 (A=1), 3 (A=2), 1 (A=3), which is the second, third, first students. So the code is building a map where the key is the A value, and the value is the original index, then iterating from 1 to N to get each A's index.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to replicate this. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nFirst, read N from input. Then read N integers into an array. Then create a structure that maps each integer (A) to its position (i). But Fortran doesn't have built-in hash maps. So since the keys are integers from 1 to N, and each is unique (since the problem is similar to arranging in order, I assume that the A's are a permutation of 1 to N). So in that case, we can use an array where the index is the A value, and the value stored is the original position. So for example, if A=3, then the array at index 3 will store i=1 (assuming that's the first element).\n\nSo in Fortran, we can declare an integer array, say, idorder, of size N. Then for each i from 1 to N, read A, then set idorder(A) = i.\n\nThen, after reading all the A's, we loop from i=1 to N, and print idorder(i) followed by a space.\n\nThat's straightforward. So the main steps are:\n\n1. Read N.\n2. Allocate the idorder array.\n3. Read N integers, and for each, store their original position in the idorder array at the index of the integer.\n4. Loop through 1 to N and print the elements of idorder in order.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, reading input. In Fortran, we can use read(*,*) to read from standard input. Let's see.\n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, A\n    integer, allocatable :: idorder(:)\n\n    read(*,*) N\n    allocate(idorder(N))\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*,*) A\n        idorder(A) = i\n    end do\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        write(*,'(I0, A)', advance='no') idorder(i), ' '\n    end do\n    write(*,*)  ! to add a new line after\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first element (i=1) is the first student, and their A is read and stored as the key. So the array in Fortran would be built correctly.\n\nTesting with the example where input is 3, then 3,1,2. Then idorder(3) = 1, idorder(1) = 2, idorder(2) =3. Then when looping from 1 to 3, we get idorder(1)=2, idorder(2)=3, idorder(3)=1. Which is printed as \"2 3 1 \".\n\nBut in Fortran, when using write with advance='no', each write will not advance the line. So in the loop, each element is written with a space. However, the last element will have an extra space. But the Java code also adds a space after each element, including the last. But looking at the Java code:\n\nSystem.out.print(idorder.get(i));\nSystem.out.print(\" \");\n\nSo the output would be like \"2 3 1 \" with a trailing space. But in practice, when you print like that, the online judges probably accept it. However, in Fortran, perhaps we can adjust to avoid the trailing space, but the original code does include it, so maybe we can replicate that.\n\nBut the code above would print all elements with a space, including the last. Then after the loop, a newline is added. But in Java, the last print is a space, but the output is followed by a new line. So perhaps in Fortran, after the loop, a write(*,*) would print a new line. But the original code uses System.out.print(\" \") each time. So the Java code's output would have a trailing space. But in some cases, that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can adjust to print the elements separated by spaces, but without the trailing space. But the problem is that the original Java code does include a trailing space. However, in programming contests, trailing spaces are usually allowed.\n\nBut the Fortran code as written would print each element followed by a space, and then after the loop, a new line. So the output would be \"2 3 1  \" (with a space and then a new line). Wait, no, after the loop, the write(*,*) adds a new line, but the loop's last write is '2 ', '3 ', '1 ' and then a new line. So the output would be \"2 3 1 \" followed by a new line. But in the Java code, the output would be \"2 3 1 \" and then a new line, because the last System.out.print(\" \") adds a space, but there's no new line. Wait, in Java, the code uses print statements, so after all the elements, there's no new line. But in practice, when you run this code, the output would be like \"2 3 1 \" followed by the command line prompt. But in programming contests, the online judges usually accept trailing spaces as long as the numbers are correct. So the Fortran code may need to avoid the trailing space. Wait, let's check.\n\nLooking at the Java code again. For N=3, the loop runs for i=1 to N. Each iteration prints the value and a space. So the output would be \"2 3 1 \" (including a space after the last number). But in programming contest problems, that's usually allowed. But some problems might require no trailing space. However, the original code does that, so the Fortran code should replicate it.\n\nBut the Fortran code as written would have all the elements printed with a space, including the last. Then the write(*,*) after the loop would add a new line. Wait, the loop in the Fortran code is:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    write(*,'(I0, A)', advance='no') idorder(i), ' '\nend do\nwrite(*,*) \n\nSo each element is written as the number followed by a space, and with advance='no' so that the next write starts on the same line. Then after the loop, a write(*,*) which outputs a new line. So the output would be \"2 3 1 \" followed by a new line. Which would have a trailing space and a new line. But the original Java code's output ends with a space and then the program ends, which may not have a new line. So is that a problem?\n\nWait, in Java, the code uses System.out.print, which does not add a new line. So after printing all N numbers and spaces, the output is a line with the numbers separated by spaces, ending with a space. Then the program exits, and the console would show the output with that line. But in programming contests, the online judge may require that the line does not end with a space. For example, if the problem statement says to output the numbers separated by spaces, but without trailing spaces, then the Java code would be incorrect. But according to the problem statement (since the user is using the original code), perhaps the trailing space is allowed.\n\nBut for the Fortran code, perhaps we need to adjust to avoid the trailing space. How?\n\nWe can handle it by printing the first N-1 elements with a space, and the last element without. But how to do that in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, collect all the elements into a string and print them at once.\n\nBut for simplicity, perhaps the code can use an implied do loop in the write statement.\n\nFor example:\n\nprint '(*(I0,:,X))', (idorder(i), i=1,N)\n\nThe format '(*(I0,:,X))' would print each integer with a space, but the : modifier suppresses the trailing space. Wait, the colon in the format specifier means that if there are no more items, the edit descriptor is skipped. So for example, using (I0,X) for each element would produce a trailing space, but with (I0,:,X) the X is only output if there is another item. So for N elements, the X would be printed after each except the last. So this format would produce the numbers separated by spaces, without a trailing space.\n\nSo using this approach would avoid the trailing space. Then, the code can be written as:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, A\n    integer, allocatable :: idorder(:)\n\n    read(*,*) N\n    allocate(idorder(N))\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*,*) A\n        idorder(A) = i\n    end do\n\n    print '(*(I0,:,X))', (idorder(i), i=1,N)\n\nend program main\n\nThis way, the print statement outputs all the elements separated by spaces, with no trailing space, and adds a new line automatically.\n\nThis would match the problem's expected output better, even if the original Java code has a trailing space. Because in programming contests, trailing spaces are often considered incorrect. For example, the sample input for this problem would have output like \"2 3 1\", and the Java code's output would be \"2 3 1 \", which would be wrong. So the original Java code may have a bug, but perhaps in the actual problem, the trailing space is allowed. But the user is asking to translate the code as is.\n\nWait, looking back at the Java code:\n\nIn the loop for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n    System.out.print(idorder.get(i));\n    System.out.print(\" \");\n}\n\nSo for N=3, this loop runs three times. So the output would be:\n\nvalue1[space]value2[space]value3[space]\n\nSo three numbers followed by three spaces. But that's not correct. For example, if the input is N=3 and the A's are 3,1,2, the output would be \"2 3 1 \" with a trailing space. Which is invalid in many programming contest problems. So perhaps the original Java code is incorrect. But the user wants to translate it, so the Fortran code should replicate the behavior exactly, including the trailing space.\n\nBut how to handle that. The Fortran code using the first approach (loop and write with advance='no') would print each number followed by a space, and then after the loop, a new line. So the output would have a trailing space and then a new line. But in the Java code, the output ends with a space and then the program terminates, which may not have a new line. But in practice, when you print to standard output in Java without a new line at the end, the output may not show up until a new line is printed. But I'm not sure. However, in programming contests, the judges usually require that the output has exactly the expected lines. So if the problem expects the numbers separated by spaces with a new line at the end, then the Java code's output may be considered correct even with the trailing space, but the new line may be missing. However, the original code's output may have a trailing space and no new line, but that's unlikely because the last print in Java adds a space, and the program ends, but the console may automatically add a new line. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but for the purposes of translation, perhaps the correct approach is to replicate the Java code's behavior as closely as possible.\n\nThe original Java code outputs each number followed by a space, including after the last number. So the output is a single line with all the numbers separated by spaces and ending with a space. But in many cases, the online judge may not care about the trailing space. However, for correctness, perhaps the Fortran code should replicate the trailing space.\n\nBut how to do that in Fortran. Using the first approach where each number is printed with a space, and then a new line. So the output would be, for N=3, \"2 3 1 \" followed by a new line. But the original Java code's output would be \"2 3 1 \" without a new line. But in practice, in programming contests, each line of output is usually required to end with a new line. So perhaps the Java code's output is missing a new line, which is a mistake. But the problem may have been designed such that the trailing space is acceptable.\n\nBut I think that in the original problem, the correct output requires the numbers separated by spaces, and no trailing space. So the Java code may have a bug. But the user is asking to translate the code as is. So in that case, the Fortran code should replicate the same output, including the trailing space and the new line.\n\nBut how to do that in Fortran. For example, if the code uses:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    write(*, '(I0, \" \")', advance='no') idorder(i)\nend do\nwrite(*,*)\n\nThis would write each number followed by a space, without advancing the line. Then after the loop, write a new line. So the output would be all numbers followed by spaces and then a new line. Which is what the Java code does, except that in Java, the final line may or may not have a new line. For example, when the program exits, the Java runtime may flush the output buffer and the console may display the line, including the trailing space, but without a new line. But in programming contest environments, this could be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original Java code's output does have a new line. Because each System.out.print adds to the same line, and after the loop, the program ends. When the program exits, the output buffer is flushed, and the line is printed, but without a new line. But the judge may require that the line ends with a new line. So the Java code may be incorrect, but the user's code is as provided.\n\nIn any case, the correct approach for the translation is to replicate the Java code's behavior. Therefore, the Fortran code should output all the numbers separated by spaces, each followed by a space, including after the last one, and then a new line. So the code would have a trailing space and a new line.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, the loop writes each number followed by a space, then after the loop, a new line is written. So the output would be \"2 3 1  \\n\" (with \\n being the new line). Which includes two spaces at the end? No, for N=3, the loop runs three times: each iteration writes the number and a space. So after three iterations, it's \"2 3 1 \" (three spaces), then the write(*,*) adds a new line. So the output would be \"2 3 1  \" followed by a new line. Wait, no. Because the loop writes:\n\nFor i=1: write \"2 \" (advance no)\ni=2: write \"3 \" (advance no)\ni=3: write \"1 \" (advance no)\nThen, the write(*,*) writes a new line. So the output is \"2 3 1 \" followed by a new line. Which is correct. But the original Java code's output would not have a new line. So this is a discrepancy.\n\nBut in Java, the program ends after the loop. The output buffer is flushed, but there's no new line. So the output would be \"2 3 1 \" (with a trailing space) but no new line. However, in many programming contest problems, output lines must end with a new line. So the Java code would be incorrect. But the user's code is as given, so we must replicate it.\n\nSo to avoid adding the new line in Fortran, perhaps we should not write the final write(*,*). But then, how to ensure that the output is flushed. Because in Fortran, if you use advance='no' in the last write, the line may not be flushed unless you explicitly do a flush.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, after writing all the elements with advance='no', the program ends. When the program ends, the output is flushed automatically, so the line is printed without a new line. But in practice, this may depend on the compiler.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original Java code's output includes a new line. For example, when running the Java code in a terminal, the output would be \"2 3 1 \" followed by the command prompt on the same line. Which is not desired.\n\nBut for the problem's sake, perhaps the correct output should end with a new line. So the Java code's output is missing a new line, and thus incorrect. But the user wants to translate the code as is.\n\nBut perhaps the original Java code does print a new line. Wait, looking at the Java code: after the loop, there's no System.out.println(). So it's using System.out.print(\" \") in each iteration, so after the loop, the output ends with a space, but no new line.\n\nSo the Fortran code should do the same. But in Fortran, each write statement by default adds a new line unless advance='no' is used. So the code:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') idorder(i), ' '\nend do\n\nAfter the loop, there's no new line. When the program ends, the output is flushed, but the line remains without a new line. Which is the same behavior as the Java code.\n\nBut in programming contests, this would likely be considered invalid. Because the problem's sample outputs usually end with a new line.\n\nSo perhaps the original Java code is incorrect, but the user wants to translate it. So in that case, the Fortran code should replicate the trailing space and no new line.\n\nBut how to do that in Fortran.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, A\n    integer, allocatable :: idorder(:)\n\n    read(*,*) N\n    allocate(idorder(N))\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*,*) A\n        idorder(A) = i\n    end do\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') idorder(i), ' '\n    end do\n\nend program main\n\nBut then, the output would be \"2 3 1 \" with no new line. But in practice, when the program ends, the output buffer is flushed, so the line is printed. But the lack of a new line might cause issues in the judge.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the code should be translated as is. So even if the original Java code's output is incorrect, the Fortran code should replicate it.\n\nBut I think that the original Java code's output has a trailing space but no new line. However, the problem's requirements likely require a new line, so perhaps the original code is wrong. But the user wants the translation, so we proceed.\n\nBut this could lead to the Fortran code being incorrect. To avoid this, perhaps in the Fortran code, after the loop, we can write a new line. But the Java code does not do that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Java code's output includes a new line. Because the last System.out.print(\" \") adds a space, but when the program ends, the line is printed with a new line. But I think that's not the case. The output in Java would be the line as is, without a new line.\n\nBut I'm not certain. To resolve this, perhaps the best approach is to match the Java code's behavior. But given the ambiguity, perhaps using the Fortran code that produces the same output as the Java code's logic, even if it includes a trailing space and no new line.\n\nBut in practice, in programming contests, the trailing new line is often required. So the correct code should include a new line.\n\nSo perhaps the original Java code is incorrect, but the user is providing it as is, and we need to translate it, including any bugs.\n\nBut given that, the Fortran code should replicate the Java code's output, including the trailing space and no new line.\n\nBut how to achieve that in Fortran.\n\nThe code I wrote earlier without the final write(*,*) would output the numbers and spaces, and the program ends. But when the program ends, the output buffer is flushed, so the line is printed. But in Fortran, when you use advance='no', the next write statement will start where it left off. So after the loop, there's no write statement, so the output is left without a new line.\n\nYes. So the code:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') idorder(i), ' '\nend do\n\nwould produce the numbers and spaces, and then the program exits. The output would be the line without a new line. Which matches the Java code.\n\nBut in programming contest environments, this might be considered incorrect. For example, if the problem's sample output is:\n\n2 3 1\n\nthen the Java code's output would be \"2 3 1 \", which would be wrong. So the original Java code is incorrect. But the user's request is to translate it, so the Fortran code must replicate it.\n\nBut in that case, the correct translation would produce the same output as the Java code.\n\nThus, the correct Fortran code is:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, A\n    integer, allocatable :: idorder(:)\n\n    read(*,*) N\n    allocate(idorder(N))\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*,*) A\n        idorder(A) = i\n    end do\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') idorder(i), ' '\n    end do\n\nend program main\n\nBut this code would not output a new line. However, in Fortran, after the loop, there's no new line written. So the output would be exactly as the Java code's.\n\nBut according to the problem's requirements, this might be incorrect. But the user wants the code translated as is.\n\nTherefore, this is the correct translation."
