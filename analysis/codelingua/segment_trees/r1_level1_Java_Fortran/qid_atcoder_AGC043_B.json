    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The main logic is in the solve method. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n and a string s. Then it constructs a new string by taking the absolute differences between consecutive characters. For example, if the original string is \"123\", the new string would be \"11\" (since |1-2|=1, |2-3|=1). If n is 2, it just outputs that first character. Otherwise, it checks if there's a '1' in the new string. If yes, it calls cal(s, '1'), otherwise cal(s, '2') multiplied by 2.\n\nThe cal function counts the number of times a character c appears at positions i where (m & i) == i. Here, m is n-1 (of the original string) minus 1? Wait, wait. Wait, in the solve method, after building the new string s, which has length n-1. Because the original string had length n, and the differences are n-1 long. So when they call cal(s, '1'), the cal function's parameter is this new s. So inside cal, the length of s is n-1. But wait, when the solve method is called, the original n is given. Let's see:\n\nOriginal n is the input. Then in the solve method, they create a new string sb with length n-1 (since i runs from 1 to n-1). So the new s (after sb.toString()) has length m = n-1 -1? Wait no. Let's see:\n\nOriginal n is the input. For example, if n is 3, the original s is length 3. Then, the sb is built by appending the differences between s[1] and s[0], then s[2] and s[1], so the new string has length 2 (n-1). So when we call cal(s, '1'), the s here is of length n-1. So in the cal function, n is the length of this new string. So m is n-1. Then for each i in 0..n-1, they check if (m & i) == i. Which is equivalent to checking whether i is a subset of the bits of m. Because m is (n-1)-1? Wait, n in the cal function is the length of the string s. For example, when the original n is 3, the new s has length 2. So in cal, n is 2, m is 1. So for each i from 0 to 1, check if (1 & i) == i. So i can be 0 (0b0) and 1 (0b1). For i=0: 1 & 0 is 0 == 0: yes. For i=1: 1 & 1 is 1 ==1: yes. So both positions are checked.\n\nThe cal function returns ans, which is the parity (XOR 1 each time) of the count of characters equal to c in positions where (m & i) == i.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about how to handle the input, the string processing, and the bitwise operations.\n\nFirst, in Java, the scanner reads input. In Fortran, we can read from standard input using read statements. So for n, we can read an integer. Then read the string s.\n\nThen, construct the new string by taking absolute differences. In Java, each character is a char, which is a 16-bit Unicode character, but here the original string is composed of digits, so subtracting them as characters gives their ASCII values. For example, '2' - '1' is 1, since ASCII values are 50 and 49. So in Fortran, each character can be handled similarly.\n\nIn Fortran, characters are handled as their ASCII values via the IACHAR function. For example, IACHAR('2') gives 50. So to compute the absolute difference between consecutive characters, we can loop through the string, compute the differences, then convert them to characters again by adding the ASCII value of '0' (48) if necessary. Wait, but in the Java code, they take the absolute value of the difference between s.charAt(i) and s.charAt(i-1), then append that as a character? Wait, no. Wait, the Java code appends Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i-1)), which is an integer. Then when they append it to the StringBuilder, it's added as a character? No, wait: the Math.abs returns an integer, but when you append an integer to a StringBuilder, it appends the string representation of that integer. Oh wait, wait! No, wait, the code in the Java is:\n\nsb.append(Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i - 1)));\n\nBut s is a String of digits. For example, if the original string is \"132\", then s.charAt(0) is '1', s.charAt(1) is '3', etc. So s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i-1) would be the difference in ASCII values. For example, '3' - '1' is 50 - 49 = 1. Then Math.abs(1) is 1. So appending that integer to the StringBuilder gives the string \"1\". So the new string is a sequence of digits representing the differences between consecutive characters.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to process each pair of consecutive characters, compute the absolute difference of their ASCII values, then convert that number to a character. Wait, no. Wait, in the Java code, when they compute Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i-1)), they are subtracting the characters (as integers), taking absolute value, which gives an integer. Then, when appending to the StringBuilder, this integer is converted to a string. For example, if s is \"123\", then the differences between '2' and '1' is 1, then between '3' and '2' is 1. So the new string is \"11\".\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the original string is something like \"132\", which would have characters '1', '3', '2'. Then the differences are '3'-'1' = 2, '2'-'3' = -1, absolute values 2 and 1. So the new string is \"21\".\n\nSo in Fortran, to replicate this, we need to take each pair of consecutive characters in the input string, compute the absolute difference between their ASCII values, and then convert that integer to a character by adding the ASCII value of '0'. For example, if the difference is 2, then the character is '0' + 2 = 50, which is '2'.\n\nSo the code for building the new string in Fortran would be:\n\noriginal_s = input string (length n)\nnew_s = empty string of length n-1 (or build it step by step)\ndo i = 2 to n (since Java uses 0-based and Fortran uses 1-based)\n   diff = abs( iachar(original_s(i)) - iachar(original_s(i-1)) )\n   new_s(i-1) = char( diff + iachar('0') )\n\nWait, but wait: in Java, the code for the new string is built as the absolute differences between consecutive characters, but stored as the string representation of those integers. Wait no, no. Let me recheck.\n\nJava code:\n\ns is the original string, say \"123\".\n\nThen, for i=1 to 2 (since n=3, loop runs from i=1 <3), so i=1 and i=2?\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <n; i++) {\n   sb.append( Math.abs( s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i-1) ) );\n}\n\nSo for each i from 1 to n-1 (since i starts at 1 and goes up to n-1 when the original s has length n). So for each i, compute the difference between s[i] and s[i-1], take absolute value, and append as a string.\n\nWait, but s.charAt(i) is a char. When you subtract two chars, you get an integer. Then Math.abs returns an integer. Then, when appending to the StringBuilder, it appends the string representation of that integer. So for example, if the difference is 1, append \"1\". If the difference is 25, append \"25\".\n\nWait, this is a problem. Wait, the code in Java appends the integer as a string. So for example, if the difference is 1, it appends \"1\". If the difference is 10, it appends \"10\". But the problem statement is from AtCoder's AGC043 B, which is likely the problem where the string is processed as digits, and the differences are single digits. But perhaps the code has a bug here. Wait, let me check the problem.\n\nWait, the problem is likely \"123\" becoming \"11\", which is correct if each difference is 1. But if the original string is \"195\", then the differences are 8 (9-1) and 4 (5-9 absolute), so the new string would be \"84\". Then, when checking for '1's, it's possible that after multiple steps, the code is considering digits in this multi-digit string. But the Java code is appending the integer as a string, which can have multiple digits. But the cal function is processing each character in the string as a single digit. So if the difference is 12, the string would have '1' and '2', which is incorrect. But perhaps the problem constraints ensure that the differences are always single digits. For example, if the original string consists of digits 0-9, then the differences between consecutive digits can be up to 9, so the absolute difference is a single digit. Hence, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code in Java works under the assumption that the differences are single digits. Therefore, the Fortran code should do the same. Therefore, when building the new string, each difference is a single digit, and thus each character in the new string is a single digit.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to compute the difference between consecutive characters, we take their ASCII values, compute the absolute difference, then convert that integer to a character by adding '0' (assuming that the difference is between 0 and 9). So for example, if the difference is 2, then the character is CHAR( IACHAR('0') + 2 ), which is '2'.\n\nSo the code to build the new string in Fortran would be:\n\noriginal_s = input string of length n\nnew_s is a string of length n-1, each character being the digit representing the difference.\n\nSo:\n\ndo i = 2, n\n   diff = abs( iachar(original_s(i:i)) - iachar(original_s(i-1:i-1)) )\n   new_s(i-1:i-1) = achar( iachar('0') + diff )\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are 1-based. So if the original_s is length n, then i runs from 2 to n, and for each i, compute the difference between original_s(i) and original_s(i-1). Then, store that in new_s at position i-1.\n\nSo new_s is of length n-1.\n\nNow, once we have new_s, if the original n (from input) is 2, then new_s is length 1. So output that character.\n\nElse, check if new_s contains '1'. If yes, compute cal(new_s, '1'), else compute cal(new_s, '2') * 2.\n\nThe cal function in Java counts the number of times c appears in positions i where (m & i) == i. Here, m is the length of the string minus 1. For example, new_s is of length m = n_new. Wait, in cal, the parameter s is the new string. So the length of s is new_length = n_original - 1 - 1? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nOriginal n is the input. Then, the new string (after processing) has length n_original - 1. For example, input n is 3, new string has length 2. So in cal, the length of s is n_new = len(s) = original_n -1. Then m is n_new -1. So for example, if original_n is 3, new_s has length 2, so m is 1. Then for each i from 0 to n_new-1 (which is 1), check if (m & i) == i. Then, if s.charAt(i) is c, add 1 to ans mod 2.\n\nSo in Fortran, the cal function would take the string s, character c, and return an integer (0 or 1).\n\nTo implement this, the Fortran code would need to:\n\n- Iterate over each position i (0-based in Java, but in Fortran 1-based?), but since Java uses 0-based indices, in Fortran we need to adjust for that. Wait, no. The Java code loops i from 0 to n-1 (0-based), where n is the length of the new string. For each i, check if (m & i) == i. So m is (n-1) -1? Wait, no. Wait, in the cal function:\n\nint n = s.length();\nint m = n -1;\n\nSo for example, if the new string is length 2, n is 2, m is 1. Then for i in 0..1, check (m & i) == i. For i=0: 1 & 0 = 0 == i: yes. For i=1: 1 & 1 =1 ==i: yes. So both positions are checked.\n\nIn Fortran, the indices are 1-based. So to replicate the Java code's logic, for each i in 0..n-1 (Java), but in Fortran, the indices are 1..n. So when translating, i in Java is (0-based), and in Fortran, we can loop i from 0 to n-1 (even though the string is 1-based). So for each i from 0 to n-1 (Java index), check if (m & i) ==i. If so, check the character at position i+1 (Fortran's index). Then, if that character is c, ans is toggled (XOR 1).\n\nSo in Fortran, for the cal function:\n\ninteger function cal(s, c)\ncharacter(len=*), intent(in) :: s\ncharacter, intent(in) :: c\ninteger :: n, m, i, ans\n\nn = len_trim(s) ! or len(s) if there's no trailing spaces?\nm = n - 1\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 0, n-1\n    if (iand(m, i) == i) then\n        if (s(i+1:i+1) == c) then\n            ans = ieor(ans, 1)\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\ncal = ans\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, len(s) gives the length of the string. So if the new_s is built correctly, len(s) would be n-1 (original input). So in the cal function, n is the length of the input string s.\n\nBut how is the string passed? When building the new_s in Fortran, if we preallocate it to the correct length (n-1), then len(s) would be correct.\n\nSo, the main steps in Fortran are:\n\nRead n and s.\n\nBuild new_s as the differences between consecutive characters.\n\nIf n ==2, output new_s's first character.\n\nElse, check if new_s contains '1'. If so, compute cal(new_s, '1'). Else compute cal(new_s, '2')*2.\n\nNow, in Fortran, checking if a string contains '1' can be done using index(s, '1') > 0.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nif (index(s, '1') > 0) then\n    ans = cal(s, '1')\nelse\n    ans = cal(s, '2') * 2\nendif\n\nThen output ans.\n\nNow, handling the input and output.\n\nIn Java, the code reads the integer n and the string s. So in Fortran, we can read them as:\n\nread(*,*) n\nread(*,*) s\n\nBut note that the input might have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, the input is a string of digits. So assuming that the input is read correctly as a string.\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading a string with read(*,*), it will read until a whitespace. So if the input is a single line with the integer and the string, like:\n\n3\n123\n\nThen the first read reads 3, the second reads '123'.\n\nBut in Java, the code uses next() for the string, which reads the next token. So Fortran's read should work similarly.\n\nNow, the code for building new_s:\n\nAssuming original_s is read as a string of length n. But when we read it with read(*,*) s, Fortran will read the entire line (if formatted correctly). Wait, but in Fortran, if the variable s is declared as character(len=200000) (for example), then reading with read(*,*) s will read the entire line into s, left-justified, and padded with spaces on the right if the input is shorter than the declared length. But the original code in Java reads the entire string, which may be of length n.\n\nSo, for example, if the input n is 3, and the string is '123', then in Fortran, s would be '123' followed by spaces up to the declared length. But when processing, we can take the first n characters.\n\nWait, but how to handle that. Let's assume that the input string is of exactly n characters. So in Fortran, when we read s, it's read as a string of exactly n characters. But Fortran's formatted read may have issues. So perhaps the code should read the entire line and then take the first n characters.\n\nAlternatively, read the string as a variable-length input. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use formatted input with a format specifier. For example, read the string as (a) to get the entire line, then trim to the correct length.\n\nBut this can be tricky. Alternatively, in Fortran code:\n\ncharacter(len=200000) :: s\nread(*,*) n\nread(*,'(a)') s\ns = adjustl(s)  ! left adjust, trimming leading spaces\ns = s(1:n)  ! take the first n characters\n\nBut perhaps the input is such that the string is exactly n characters, so after reading, the first n characters are the correct ones.\n\nAssuming that the code reads the string properly, then proceed.\n\nNow, let's outline the Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, ans\n    character(len=200000) :: s, new_s\n    logical :: has_one\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) n\n    read(*,'(a)') s\n    s = trim(s)  ! assuming no trailing spaces? Or take first n characters?\n    s = s(1:n)   ! ensure length n\n\n    if (n == 1) then\n        ! but according to Java code, when n=2, output new_s(1:1)\n        ! but if original n is 1, the code would have new_s of length 0?\n        ! Wait, in Java code, for n=2, the new_s has length 1. For n=1, perhaps the code is not handling that.\n\n        ! But according to the Java code, when n is 2, the code outputs the first character of new_s. So if the original input is n=2, then new_s is of length 1, which is the difference between the two characters.\n\n        ! So in the code, n can't be 1. Because when n=1, the code in the solve method would process the loop from i=1 to i <n (i <1), so the loop doesn't run. Then new_s is empty. But in Java code, when n=2, the code works. So perhaps the problem constraints have n >= 2. So in Fortran, we can proceed under that assumption.\n\n    else\n        call build_new_string(n, s, new_s)\n    end if\n\n    if (n == 2) then\n        print '(i0)', iachar(new_s(1:1)) - iachar('0')  ! since new_s is a single character, output its numeric value\n        ! Wait, but in Java, when n=2, new_s has length 1, which is a string like \"5\", and the code outputs the first character. So in Java, it's printed as a character, but since the output is a digit, in the problem's context, the output is the numeric value of that character. Wait, but the Java code's output is the character, which is the same as the integer. For example, if new_s is \"5\", then the output is 5.\n\n        So in Fortran, when n=2, we need to output the numeric value of the first character of new_s. But new_s is built as the difference between the first two characters, which is stored as a character. So for example, if new_s(1:1) is '5', then the numeric value is 5.\n\n        So in Fortran, we can compute:\n\n        print '(i0)', iachar(new_s(1:1)) - iachar('0')\n\n    else\n        has_one = (index(new_s, '1') > 0)\n        if (has_one) then\n            ans = cal(new_s, '1')\n        else\n            ans = cal(new_s, '2') * 2\n        end if\n        print '(i0)', ans\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine build_new_string(n, s, new_s)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n        character(len=*), intent(out) :: new_s\n        integer :: i, diff\n\n        do i = 2, n\n            diff = abs( iachar(s(i:i)) - iachar(s(i-1:i-1)) )\n            new_s(i-1:i-1) = achar( iachar('0') + diff )\n        end do\n    end subroutine build_new_string\n\n    integer function cal(s, c)\n        character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n        character, intent(in) :: c\n        integer :: n, m, i, ans\n\n        n = len_trim(s)  ! or len(s) if new_s is exactly length n-1?\n        m = n - 1\n        ans = 0\n\n        do i = 0, n-1\n            if (iand(m, i) == i) then\n                if (s(i+1:i+1) == c) then\n                    ans = ieor(ans, 1)\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        cal = ans\n    end function cal\n\nend program main\n\nBut wait, when building new_s, the length of new_s is n-1. So in the build_new_string subroutine, new_s is declared as a character(len=*), which in Fortran requires that the actual argument has a defined length. So when passing new_s from the main program, it should be declared as a character(len=n-1) where n is the original input. So the main program needs to allocate new_s with length n-1.\n\nBut in Fortran, the length of a character variable is fixed at compile time unless using allocatable arrays. But since n can be up to 2e5 or similar, we need to handle variable lengths.\n\nSo perhaps we can use an allocatable character variable.\n\nWait, but Fortran 2003 allows deferred-length character variables.\n\nSo in the main program:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: new_s\n\nThen, after reading n, if n >= 2:\n\nallocate( character(len=n-1) :: new_s )\ncall build_new_string(n, s, new_s)\n\nBut wait, the build_new_string subroutine would then need to have new_s with length n-1. So the loop runs from i=2 to n (original s's indices), and for each, write to i-1 in new_s.\n\nYes.\n\nSo modifying the main program:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, ans\n    character(len=200000) :: s\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: new_s\n    logical :: has_one\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    read(*,'(a)') s\n    s = s(1:n)  ! trim to n characters\n\n    if (n == 2) then\n        allocate( character(len=1) :: new_s )\n        call build_new_string(n, s, new_s)\n        print '(i0)', iachar(new_s(1:1)) - iachar('0')\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    if (n >= 3) then\n        allocate( character(len=n-1) :: new_s )\n        call build_new_string(n, s, new_s)\n    else\n        ! handle n=1, but according to problem constraints, probably n >=2\n        print *, 0\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    has_one = (index(new_s, '1') > 0)\n    if (has_one) then\n        ans = cal(new_s, '1')\n    else\n        ans = cal(new_s, '2') * 2\n    end if\n\n    print '(i0)', ans\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine build_new_string(n, s, new_s)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n        character(len=*), intent(out) :: new_s\n        integer :: i, diff, pos\n\n        do i = 2, n\n            diff = abs( iachar(s(i:i)) - iachar(s(i-1:i-1)) )\n            new_s(i-1:i-1) = achar( iachar('0') + diff )\n        end do\n    end subroutine build_new_string\n\n    integer function cal(s, c)\n        character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n        character, intent(in) :: c\n        integer :: n, m, i, ans\n\n        n = len(s)\n        m = n - 1\n        ans = 0\n\n        do i = 0, n-1\n            if (iand(m, i) == i) then\n                if (s(i+1:i+1) == c) then\n                    ans = ieor(ans, 1)\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        cal = ans\n    end function cal\n\nend program main\n\nBut wait, when n is 2, new_s is of length 1. The code then prints the first character's numeric value.\n\nIn the cal function, len(s) is used, which is correct for the new_s's length.\n\nNow, testing the code with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n121\n\nThe new string is built as differences between '2'-'1' =1, '1'-'2' =-1 \u2192 absolute 2. So new_s is \"12\".\n\nThen, since new_s contains '1', cal is called with '1'.\n\nIn cal, n is 2, m=1.\n\nFor i=0: m=1 &0=0 ==0 \u2192 yes. Check s[0+1] = '1' \u2192 yes. ans becomes 1.\n\nFor i=1: m=1 &1=1 \u2192 yes. Check s[2] = '2' \u2192 no. ans remains 1.\n\nSo cal returns 1. So output is 1.\n\nSample Input 2:\n2\n12\n\nnew_s is \"1\". Output is 1.\n\nSample Input 3:\n4\n1211\n\nOriginal s is \"1211\". Compute differences:\n\n2-1=1 \u2192 1.\n\n1-2= -1 \u2192 1.\n\n1-1=0 \u21920.\n\nnew_s is \"110\".\n\nSince new_s contains '1', cal is called with '1'.\n\nn is 3, m=2.\n\ni ranges from 0 to 2.\n\nFor i=0: 2&0=0 ==0 \u2192 yes. s[1] is '1' \u2192 ans=1.\n\ni=1: 2&1=0 \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: 2&2=2 \u2192 yes. s[3] is '0' \u2192 no.\n\nans is 1. So output 1.\n\nAnother test case where new_s has no '1's. For example, input n=3, s= '232'.\n\nDifferences are 1 (3-2) and 1 (2-3 absolute). new_s is \"11\". So has '1's. cal returns 1+1 \u2192 ans=0, since 1^1=0. Wait no:\n\nWait, in cal for new_s '11', n=2, m=1.\n\ni=0: check if (1 &0) ==0 \u2192 yes. s[1] is '1' \u2192 ans=1.\n\ni=1: (1 &1) ==1 \u2192 yes. s[2] is '1' \u2192 ans=0.\n\nSo cal returns 0. So output is 0.\n\nBut wait, in Java, when the code calls cal(s, '1') for \"11\", the ans starts at 0. For each i:\n\ni=0: s[0] is '1' and (1 &0) ==0 \u2192 ans ^=1 \u21921.\n\ni=1: s[1] is '1' and (1 &1) ==1 \u2192 ans ^=1 \u21920.\n\nSo returns 0. Which matches.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should replicate this.\n\nNow, code in Fortran for this case would create new_s of length 2. cal is called, n=2, m=1.\n\nLoop i=0 and 1.\n\nFor i=0, check if iand(1,0) ==0 \u2192 yes. s(1) is '1' \u2192 ans becomes 1.\n\nFor i=1: iand(1,1)=1 ==1 \u2192 yes. s(2) is '1' \u2192 ans becomes 0.\n\nSo returns 0.\n\nHence, code works.\n\nNow, handling the case where new_s has no '1's. For example, new_s is \"2222\".\n\nThen, cal is called with '2', and the result is multiplied by 2.\n\nSuppose new_s is \"22\". n=2, m=1.\n\ni=0: iand(1,0)=0 \u2192 check s[1] \u2192 '2' \u2192 ans becomes 1.\n\ni=1: iand(1,1)=1 \u2192 check s[2] \u2192 '2' \u2192 ans becomes 0.\n\nSo cal returns 0. Output is 0 *2=0.\n\nSo code works.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java code."
