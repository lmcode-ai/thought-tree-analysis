    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what the original code does. \n\nThe Java program has a Box class with num and red properties. The main method reads N and M, initializes an array of Boxes, and processes M moves between boxes. Then, it counts how many boxes have red set to true.\n\nFortran is a procedural language, and doesn't have classes. So I'll need to represent the Boxes using arrays. Let's think: each Box has a num and a red flag. So maybe two arrays: one integer array for num, and a logical array for red.\n\nThe initial setup is that the first box has num=1 and red=true, others have num=1 and red=false. Wait, no: looking at the Java code, B[0] is created with (1, true), and others (from 1 to N-1) are (1, false). Wait, no, wait in the loop for i from 1 to N-1, the code does B[i] = new Box(1, false). So each Box starts with num=1, but only the first has red=true. Then, for M moves, each move is between x and y (after converting to 0-based indices). \n\nThe moveTo method in Box: when moving from one box to another, the logic is:\n- If the source's num is 0, do nothing.\n- Else if num is 1:\n   - source's num becomes 0\n   - destination's num increases by 1\n   - if source was red, destination's red becomes true\n   - source's red is set to false\n- Else:\n   - source's num decreases by 1\n   - destination's num increases by 1\n   - if source was red, destination's red becomes true (but source's red remains?)\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to model the boxes with their num and red. Let's use two arrays: num(N) and red(N). Initialize num to 1 for all, then red(1) is .true., others .false. Wait, Java uses 0-based indices, so the first box is index 0. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so maybe adjust the indices. So when reading x and y, subtract 1 to get 0-based, but in Fortran, we can just use 1-based. Wait, the original code uses x and y as 0-based indices. So in the Java code, when the input is given, they subtract 1 to get the index. For example, input x is the box number (1-based), and then converted to 0-based. So in Fortran, when reading x and y, we can just keep them as 1-based. So perhaps in the Fortran code, the input x and y are read as is, but in the code, x and y are used directly as indices. So no need to subtract 1. Wait, let me check the Java code:\n\nThe input x and y are read, then x is subtracted by 1, y by 1 to get the indices. So for example, if the input is 1 2, then x becomes 0, y becomes 1. So in Fortran, when we read x and y, we can just use them as is, since Fortran arrays are 1-based. Wait no: in Java, after subtracting 1, the indices are 0-based. So the input x and y are 1-based (like box numbers), converted to 0-based indices. So in Fortran, since we use 1-based arrays, we can just read x and y as the box numbers and use them directly. So the code in Fortran would process x and y as 1-based, which matches the input. So that's a difference to handle.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N and M.\n\n2. Initialize num and red arrays. num(1) is 1, red(1) is .true. For i from 2 to N, num(i)=1, red(i)=.false.\n\n3. For M operations: read x and y. Then perform the move from x to y.\n\n4. After all moves, count how many boxes have red(i) is .true.\n\nNow, the moveTo logic. Let's model that with a subroutine. Since in Java, the moveTo is called on the source box (B[x]) and the destination is B[y]. So in Fortran, for each move between x and y, we need to process the move from x to y.\n\nLet's think about the moveTo logic step by step. The source is x, destination is y.\n\nSo in the move:\n\nIf num(x) == 0: do nothing.\n\nElse if num(x) == 1:\n\n- subtract 1 from num(x) (so becomes 0)\n- add 1 to num(y)\n- if red(x) is true, then set red(y) to true.\n- then set red(x) to false.\n\nElse:\n\n- subtract 1 from num(x)\n- add 1 to num(y)\n- if red(x) is true, set red(y) to true. (Note: the original code's moveTo in the else part, when num is greater than 1, sets other.red to true if this.red is true. But the source's red is not changed, except when it's the case of num=1. Wait, in the Java code, when moving, the source's red is only set to false when the num is 1. Otherwise, the source's red remains as is. So when moving, if the source has red, the destination's red becomes true (if it wasn't already), but the source's red is only cleared if the source's num was 1 and it's being moved (so after moving, the source has num=0, red=false). \n\nSo in the general case (num >1), moving one ball from x to y. If x was red, then y's red becomes true. So in Fortran, regardless of the source's num (as long as it's >=1), if red(x) is true, then y's red is set to true.\n\nBut in the case where the source's num is 1, after moving, the source's red is set to false. Otherwise, the source's red remains as before.\n\nSo in Fortran, when processing a move between x and y:\n\nFirst, check if num(x) is zero. If so, nothing.\n\nElse:\n\n   if num(x) == 1 then:\n\n      num(x) = num(x) - 1  --> becomes 0\n\n      num(y) = num(y) + 1\n\n      if red(x) is true:\n\n          red(y) = .true.\n\n      red(x) = .false.\n\n   else:\n\n      num(x) = num(x) -1\n\n      num(y) = num(y) +1\n\n      if red(x) is .true.:\n\n          red(y) = .true.\n\nSo the code for each move would involve:\n\nsubroutine move(x, y, num, red)\n\nBut since in Fortran, we can't pass the entire arrays unless they are in modules or passed as arguments. But in this case, perhaps better to handle the logic inline.\n\nSo in the main loop, for each move:\n\nread x and y\n\nthen:\n\nif (num(x) == 0) then\n    cycle\nelse if (num(x) == 1) then\n    num(x) = num(x) - 1\n    num(y) = num(y) + 1\n    if (red(x)) then\n        red(y) = .true.\n    end if\n    red(x) = .false.\nelse\n    num(x) = num(x) -1\n    num(y) = num(y) +1\n    if (red(x)) then\n        red(y) = .true.\n    end if\nend if\n\nYes, that's the logic.\n\nNow, for the initial setup:\n\nnum(1:N) = 1\n\nred(1) = .true.\n\nred(2:N) = .false.\n\nSo in Fortran, arrays start at 1.\n\nNow, read N and M. Then process M moves.\n\nFinally, count the number of red boxes where red is .true.\n\nNow, possible corner cases: N=1? Let's see.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the variable declarations:\n\ninteger :: N, M\n\ninteger, allocatable :: num(:)\n\nlogical, allocatable :: red(:)\n\ninteger :: i, x, y, counter\n\nread *, N, M\n\nallocate(num(N), red(N))\n\nnum = 1\n\nred = .false.\n\nred(1) = .true.\n\nThen, process M moves:\n\ndo i = 1, M\n\n    read *, x, y\n\n    if (num(x) == 0) then\n\n        cycle\n\n    else if (num(x) == 1) then\n\n        num(x) = 0\n\n        num(y) = num(y) + 1\n\n        if (red(x)) then\n\n            red(y) = .true.\n\n        end if\n\n        red(x) = .false.\n\n    else\n\n        num(x) = num(x) - 1\n\n        num(y) = num(y) + 1\n\n        if (red(x)) then\n\n            red(y) = .true.\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, count the number of red boxes:\n\ncounter = 0\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n    if (red(i)) then\n\n        counter = counter + 1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nprint *, counter\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, when moving, even if other.red was already true, it's set to true again. But in Fortran, since once red is true, setting it again to true doesn't change anything. So no problem.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- When x and y are the same box? For example, if x == y, then moving from x to x. But in the code, it's allowed. For example, if x has 2 balls. Then after moving, x would have 2-1 +1 = 2. But since the code's moveTo method handles that. So in Fortran, same logic applies.\n\nAnother thing: the Box class's moveTo method is called as B[x].moveTo(B[y]). So in the Java code, x is the source, y is the destination. So in the Fortran code, each move is from x to y.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nFor example, the sample input from AGC002 B might be something like:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\nSample Output: 2\n\nWait, but let's see. Let's think through the code.\n\nBut perhaps that's not needed here. The translation seems correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code will have:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC002_B\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: N, M, x, y, i, counter\n\n    integer, allocatable :: num(:)\n\n    logical, allocatable :: red(:)\n\n    read(*, *) N, M\n\n    allocate(num(N), red(N))\n\n    num = 1\n\n    red = .false.\n\n    red(1) = .true.\n\n    do i = 1, M\n\n        read(*, *) x, y\n\n        if (num(x) == 0) then\n\n            cycle\n\n        else if (num(x) == 1) then\n\n            num(x) = 0\n\n            num(y) = num(y) + 1\n\n            if (red(x)) then\n\n                red(y) = .true.\n\n            end if\n\n            red(x) = .false.\n\n        else\n\n            num(x) = num(x) - 1\n\n            num(y) = num(y) + 1\n\n            if (red(x)) then\n\n                red(y) = .true.\n\n            end if\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    counter = 0\n\n    do i = 1, N\n\n        if (red(i)) then\n\n            counter = counter + 1\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    print *, counter\n\nend program atcoder_AGC002_B\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nI think that's the correct translation."
