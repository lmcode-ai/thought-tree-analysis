    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads an integer n, then reads n integers. It counts the frequency of each integer using a HashMap. Then it finds the maximum frequency and the number of unique integers. Finally, it prints the maximum frequency followed by the size of the map (the count of unique integers).\n\nFortran doesn't have HashMaps, so I need to find another way to track the frequencies. Maybe I can use an array to store the counts. But since the input values can be up to 1000 (as per some codeforces problem constraints?), maybe the problem allows for a maximum value that we can use as the array size. Wait, the original problem here is codeforces_37_A, which is likely problem 37A from Codeforces. Let me recall that problem. Oh right, the problem is about towers made of planks. Each plank has a certain length. The problem requires finding the maximum height of the towers (which is the maximum frequency of any length) and the number of towers (the number of distinct lengths).\n\nIn the original problem, the lengths are up to 1000. So in Fortran, we can use an array of size 1000+ to count frequencies. That's easier than using a hash map.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Initialize an array counts(1:1000) to zero.\n3. For each input number, increment counts(number) by 1.\n4. After processing all inputs, find the maximum value in counts (max_count) and count how many elements in counts are greater than zero (unique_count).\n5. Output max_count and unique_count concatenated together.\n\nWait, but in Java, the map's size is the number of unique keys, so in Fortran, it's the number of elements in counts that are non-zero. So we loop through 1 to 1000 and count how many counts(i) > 0.\n\nBut wait, what if the input values can be larger than 1000? The original problem's constraints probably limit the plank lengths. Let me check. The original problem 37A (Towers) says that the lengths are between 1 and 1000. So yes, using an array of size 1000 is safe.\n\nSo, the Fortran code can proceed as such.\n\nBut how to read the inputs? In Fortran, we can read the entire line as a list of integers. Let's see. The user inputs n, then a list of n integers. So in Fortran:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read a line with n integers. Then loop through each integer, and increment the counts array.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ninteger :: n, i, val, max_count, unique_count\ninteger, dimension(1000) :: counts = 0\n\nRead n:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nThen read the next line as n integers:\n\ninteger, dimension(n) :: arr\nread(*,*) (arr(i), i=1, n)\n\nThen loop through each element in arr:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    val = arr(i)\n    counts(val) = counts(val) + 1\nend do\n\nThen compute max_count:\n\nmax_count = maxval(counts)\n\nThen compute unique_count by counting non-zero elements:\n\nunique_count = 0\ndo i = 1, 1000\n    if (counts(i) > 0) unique_count = unique_count + 1\nend do\n\nThen output max_count followed by unique_count, concatenated as a string. But in Fortran, we can write them as two integers separated by a space, but the Java code outputs them concatenated. Wait, the Java code's output line is:\n\nSystem.out.println(max + \"\" + map.size());\n\nSo if max is 3 and map.size() is 5, it prints \"35\".\n\nBut in Fortran, how to output them as a single string? We can format them as such.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nprint '(I0, I0)', max_count, unique_count\n\nThe I0 format specifier writes integers without leading spaces. So concatenating them would work.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut wait, let's check for possible errors. For example, if the input numbers are 0 or larger than 1000, but according to the problem constraints, they are between 1 and 1000. So the code should handle that.\n\nSo the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_37_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, val, max_count, unique_count\n    integer, dimension(1000) :: counts = 0\n    integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(arr(n))\n    read(*,*) arr\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        val = arr(i)\n        counts(val) = counts(val) + 1\n    end do\n\n    max_count = maxval(counts)\n    unique_count = 0\n\n    do i = 1, 1000\n        if (counts(i) > 0) unique_count = unique_count + 1\n    end do\n\n    print '(I0, I0)', max_count, unique_count\n\nend program codeforces_37_A\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the output is the maximum count followed by the size of the map (unique_count), concatenated. So yes, this code should work.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the counts start from any possible integer. But according to the problem statement, the planks' lengths are between 1 and 1000. So the Fortran code's array from 1 to 1000 is correct.\n\nThis should handle all cases. Now, test with some example input.\n\nFor example, the sample input from problem 37A:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n1 2 3\n\nSample Output:\n1 3 \u2192 Output would be \"13\"\n\nWait, the Java code prints the maximum frequency (1) followed by the number of unique (3), so \"13\".\n\nIn Fortran code, the code would output the same.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\n6 5 6 7\n\nSample Output: 2 3 (since 6 occurs twice, and there are three unique numbers). So the output is \"23\".\n\nYes, the Fortran code would produce that.\n\nSo the translation looks correct."
