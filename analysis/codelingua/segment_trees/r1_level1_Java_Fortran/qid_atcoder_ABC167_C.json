So, the problem seems to be about selecting some books (n in total) such that their combined algorithms (m types) each meet a minimum requirement x. The goal is to find the minimum cost. Each book has a cost and then m algorithm values. The approach is to check all possible subsets of the books using bitmasking, calculate the total algorithms for each subset, check if they meet the requirements, and keep track of the minimum cost.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps the Java code takes:\n\n1. Read input: n, m, x.\n2. Read n rows of data, each with m+1 elements (cost followed by m algorithms).\n3. Iterate over all possible subsets of the books (using bitmask from 0 to 2^n -1).\n4. For each subset, check which books are selected (using bitmask bits).\n5. Sum the cost and algorithms of the selected books.\n6. Check if all algorithms meet or exceed x. If yes, update the minimum cost if this is cheaper.\n7. After checking all subsets, output the minimum cost or -1 if impossible.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the differences between Java and Fortran here.\n\nFirst, in Java, the code uses a 2D array a[n][m+1]. In Fortran, arrays are column-major, but for simplicity, we can use a 2D array with dimensions (n, m+1). Wait, in Java it's a[i][j], where i is the book index, j=0 is the cost, j=1 to m are the algorithms. So in Fortran, perhaps a 2D array of (m+1, n) would be more natural? Or maybe (n, m+1), since in Java, the first index is the book. Hmm, in Fortran, when you have a 2D array arr(n, m), the first index is row, second column. So perhaps when we read the input, each book's data is stored in a row. So maybe declare a as a(n, m+1), same as Java.\n\nNext, the loop for all subsets. Java uses a loop from 0 to 2^n -1. For each i, it checks each bit j (from 0 to n-1) to see if the j-th bit is set. Then for each selected book, sum the cost and algorithms.\n\nIn Fortran, since we can't have a loop up to 2**n when n could be up to, say, 12 (since 2^12 is 4096), but the original problem's constraints probably allow this. So in Fortran, the loop can be written as do i=0, 2**n -1. But wait, in Java, the code uses Math.pow(2, n), which returns a double. So for n up to 30, it's okay, but for larger n, this would cause issues. But given the problem constraints (probably from AtCoder's ABC167 C), n is up to 12 or 13, so manageable.\n\nBut in Fortran, exponentiating integers: 2**n. So for i in 0 to 2**n -1. But 2**n can be calculated as a integer. However, for n=12, 2^12=4096, which is manageable.\n\nNow, for each i, we need to check each bit. For j from 0 to n-1. The bit check is done via (i >> j) & 1. In Fortran, we can use the bitwise functions. For example, btest(i, j) returns true if the j-th bit (starting from 0) is set. So for each j in 0 to n-1, if btest(i, j) is true, then that book is selected.\n\nThen, accumulate the cost and algorithms. So in Fortran, we can create a res array (size m+1), initialized to zero. For each selected book, add the a(j+1, 1) to res(0), and a(j+1, 2..m+1) to res(1..m). Wait, wait, in the Java code, a[i][j] for j=0 is the cost, j=1..m are the algorithms. So in Fortran, if the array is a(n, m+1), then for the j-th book (Java's i), a(j, 1) is the cost, a(j, 2..m+1) are the algorithms. Wait, no: Java's code reads a[i][j], where j runs from 0 to m. So for each row, the first element is the cost, then m elements of algorithms. So in Fortran, if the array is a(n, m+1), then for the i-th book (Java's i-th row), a(i, 1) is the cost (j=0 in Java), a(i, 2) to a(i, m+1) are the algorithms (j=1 to m in Java).\n\nWait, in Java, the code for a[i][j] where j ranges from 0 to m. So for each book i, the first element (j=0) is the cost, followed by m elements. So in Fortran, the array would be a(n, m+1). Then, for the i-th book (i from 1 to n in Fortran), a(i, 1) is the cost, a(i, 2) to a(i, m+1) are the m algorithms.\n\nNow, for each subset (bitmask i), we need to check each bit j (0 to n-1). If the bit is set, select the (j+1)-th book in Fortran (since Java's j starts from 0). Then, for that book, add all the elements (cost and algorithms) to the res array.\n\nWait, Java's code for res[k] += a[j][k], where k runs from 0 to m. So res[0] is the sum of the costs, res[1..m] are the sum of the algorithms.\n\nSo in Fortran, res would be an array of size m+1, with res(1) being the cost sum, res(2..m+1) the algorithm sums. Wait no: in Java, the code uses res[0] for the cost, and res[1..m] for the algorithms. So in Fortran, perhaps res(1) is the cost, res(2:m+1) are the algorithm sums. Then, when checking, we need to see if all res(2..m+1) >= x.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after summing for the selected books, they check for each j from 1 to m (res[j] >=x). Because in Java, res[0] is the total cost, res[1] to res[m] are the algorithms. So in Fortran, res would be (0:m), but in Fortran arrays start at 1 by default, but perhaps it's easier to use indices 1 to m+1, where 1 is the cost, 2 to m+1 are the algorithms.\n\nBut maybe the Fortran code can have res(1) as the cost, res(2 to m+1) as the algorithm sums. Then, after summing, check if all elements of res(2 to m+1) are >= x.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\n- Read n, m, x.\n- Allocate a 2D array a(n, m+1) to hold the cost and m algorithms for each of the n books.\n- Read each of the n books' data into a(i, 1) (cost), a(i, 2 to m+1) (algorithms).\n- Initialize min_val to a large value. In Java, it's Integer.MAX_VALUE. In Fortran, we can use a huge value, like huge(0) (assuming integers).\n- Loop over i from 0 to 2**n -1:\n   - For each i, check each bit j (0 to n-1). For each j, if the j-th bit is set, then select the (j+1)-th book (since Fortran indices start at 1).\n   - Initialize res array to 0 for each iteration.\n   - For each selected book, add a(book, 1) to res(1), and a(book, 2..m+1) to res(2..m+1).\n   - Check if all elements of res(2..m+1) are >=x. If yes, check if res(1) is less than min_val. If so, update min_val.\n- After all subsets, if min_val is still the initial value, output -1, else output min_val.\n\nNow, let's think about possible issues:\n\n1. Fortran's bit operations: the btest function. For example, btest(i, j) returns true if the j-th bit (0-based) of i is 1. So, for i in 0 to 2**n -1, and j from 0 to n-1.\n\n2. The loop for i in 0 to 2**n -1: in Fortran, we can write it as do i=0, 2**n -1. But wait, in Fortran, exponentiation is with **. However, 2**n can be a large number when n is big. So for n up to, say, 20, 2**n is 1,048,576 which is manageable. For the original problem, probably n is up to 12, so 4096 iterations. So no problem.\n\n3. The res array needs to be reinitialized for each i. So for each i, we set res = 0, then accumulate.\n\n4. Checking if all the algorithms meet the threshold: in Fortran, we can loop from j=2 to m+1 and check if all res(j) >=x. If any is less, set flag to false.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nLet's outline the steps in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variable declarations:\n\ninteger :: n, m, x, min_val\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:,:)\ninteger :: i, j, k, total_comb, book\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: res\nlogical :: flag\n\nRead input:\n\nread(*,*) n, m, x\nallocate(a(n, m+1))\ndo i=1, n\n    read(*,*) a(i, :)\nend do\n\nInitialize min_val to a large value:\n\nmin_val = huge(0)\n\nCompute total_comb = 2**n -1\n\ndo i=0, 2**n -1\n    ! For each bit j (0 to n-1), check if set\n    res = 0\n    do j=0, n-1\n        if (btest(i, j)) then\n            book = j + 1 ! since j starts from 0, book is 1-based\n            res(1) = res(1) + a(book, 1)\n            do k=2, m+1\n                res(k) = res(k) + a(book, k)\n            end do\n        end if\n    end do\n    ! Check if all algorithms meet x\n    flag = .true.\n    do k=2, m+1\n        if (res(k) < x) then\n            flag = .false.\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n    if (flag) then\n        if (res(1) < min_val) then\n            min_val = res(1)\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nAfter loop:\n\nif (min_val == huge(0)) then\n    print *, -1\nelse\n    print *, min_val\nend if\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, when allocating res, we need to allocate it with size m+1. But how to handle the dynamic allocation inside the loop. Maybe declare res as an array of size m+1.\n\nWait, in the code above, when we allocate a, it's a(n, m+1). For res, which is of size m+1 (elements 1 to m+1), we can allocate it once outside the loop.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: res\nallocate(res(m+1))\n\nThen, in each iteration of i, reset res to zero:\n\nres = 0\n\nBut in Fortran, array assignment can be done as res = 0, which sets all elements to zero.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, x, min_val\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:,:)\n    integer :: i, j, k, book\n    integer, allocatable :: res(:)\n    logical :: flag\n\n    read(*,*) n, m, x\n    allocate(a(n, m+1))\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) a(i, :)\n    end do\n\n    min_val = huge(0)\n    allocate(res(m+1))\n\n    do i = 0, 2**n -1\n        res = 0\n        do j = 0, n-1\n            if (btest(i, j)) then\n                book = j + 1\n                res(1) = res(1) + a(book, 1)\n                do k = 2, m+1\n                    res(k) = res(k) + a(book, k)\n                end do\n            end if\n        end do\n        flag = .true.\n        do k = 2, m+1\n            if (res(k) < x) then\n                flag = .false.\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (flag) then\n            if (res(1) < min_val) then\n                min_val = res(1)\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (min_val == huge(0)) then\n        print *, -1\n    else\n        print *, min_val\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(a)\n    deallocate(res)\nend program main\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the first element of a's row is the cost (a[i][0] in Java), and the next m elements are the algorithms. So when reading into a(i, :), in Fortran, the first element of the row is the cost, then the m algorithms. So a(i, 1) is cost, a(i, 2 to m+1) are algorithms. So the code is correct here.\n\nNow, possible issues to check:\n\n- The loop i from 0 to 2**n -1. For n=0, but n is at least 1. The code should handle that.\n\n- The use of btest. The first argument is the integer to test. Since i is non-negative, and j ranges from 0 to n-1. So btest(i, j) returns whether the j-th bit is set. Correct.\n\n- The book variable: j ranges from 0 to n-1. book = j+1 gives the correct 1-based index for the a array.\n\n- The res array: res(1) is the sum of the costs. res(2 to m+1) are the sum of each algorithm. Then, checking those >=x.\n\nPotential optimizations: since m can be up to 12 (as per original problem's constraints?), but the code should handle any m as per input.\n\nNow, test case: let's consider a simple case.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 10\n60 2 2 4\n70 8 7 9\n50 2 3 9\n\nIn Java, this would loop over all 8 subsets. The valid subsets are those that have algorithms each >=10. For example, books 2 and 3: 70+50=120 cost. Algorithms: 8+2=10, 7+3=10, 9+9=18. All >=10, so cost 120. Another valid subset is all three books: cost 60+70+50=180, algorithms 2+8+2=12, etc. So the minimal is 120.\n\nIn Fortran, the code should compute the same.\n\nAnother test case: if no combination meets the criteria, output -1.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran code, considering all the above steps.\n\nI think the code I've written should work. But let's check for possible mistakes:\n\n- Fortran's array indexing starts at 1 by default. So when reading into a(i, :), the first element is the cost, then m algorithms. Correct.\n\n- The res array is correctly adding the a(book, 1) (cost) to res(1), and the algorithms (a(book, 2..m+1)) to res(2..m+1). Correct.\n\n- The flag checks res(2..m+1) >=x. Correct.\n\n- The min_val is initialized to huge(0), which is the maximum integer value. So if any valid subset is found, min_val will be updated. If none, output -1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final Fortran code should look like the above."
