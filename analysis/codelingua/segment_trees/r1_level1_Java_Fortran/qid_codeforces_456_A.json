    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's look at the Java code first. The main logic is reading input, processing arrays, and checking some conditions to determine the output.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n, then two arrays a and b of size n. It then iterates through each element, updating variables temp, q, w, e, and checking various conditions to set the boolean f to true.\n\nIn Fortran, I'll need to declare variables properly. Fortran uses static typing, so I need to define the types. The arrays a and b will be allocated based on the input n. Also, Fortran's I/O is different, so reading from standard input using READ statements.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the integer n.\n2. Allocate arrays a and b with size n.\n3. Read n pairs of integers into a and b.\n4. Initialize variables temp, q, w, e, f.\n5. Loop from i=1 to n (since Fortran is 1-based by default).\n6. For each a(i) and b(i), perform the same checks as in Java.\n7. After processing all elements, check if f is true and print the result.\n\nWait, Java uses 0-based arrays, and Fortran uses 1-based by default. So when looping, in Java it's from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, the loop should be from 1 to n.\n\nAlso, the variables temp, q, etc., are initialized in Java. Let's see: temp starts at 0. Then in each iteration, if a[i] is larger than temp, update temp and q. Wait, but in the first iteration, temp is 0. So for the first element, since a[0] is likely positive, temp will be set to a[0], and q to b[0].\n\nIn the Fortran code, variables should be initialized properly. For example, temp starts as 0. Then during the loop, compare a(i) with temp. Similarly for other variables.\n\nLet me check the Java code's logic step by step:\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n- a[i] and b[i] are read.\n- If temp < a[i]: then check if q (previous q) > current b[i]. If yes, set f=true. Then update q and temp to current a and b.\n- If temp > a[i]: check if q < current b[i], set f=true. Update q and temp.\n- Then check if a[i] > w (which starts at 0). If so, update w to a[i], check if b[i] < e (which was initialized to 0), if yes, set f=true. Then set e to b[i].\n- If a[i] < w, check if current b[i] > e, set f=true.\n\nHmm. So variables temp and q track the maximum a[i] encountered so far (since temp is compared to a[i], and when a[i] is larger, temp is updated). Wait, no: in the first part, when temp < a[i], then temp becomes a[i], so temp is tracking the maximum a[i] so far. But then there's a part where temp > a[i], so maybe temp is being compared each time.\n\nWait, the code seems a bit complex. Let's see:\n\nThe code for each a[i], b[i]:\n\nFirst block:\nif (temp < a[i]) {\n    if (q > b[i]) {\n        f = true;\n    }\n    q = b[i];\n    temp = a[i];\n}\n\nSecond block:\nif (temp > a[i]) {\n    if (q < b[i]) {\n        f = true;\n    }\n    q = b[i];\n    temp = a[i];\n}\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Wait, after the first block, temp is set to a[i], so the second block's condition (temp > a[i]) would only be true if in the same iteration, the first block's condition was not true. Because after the first block, temp is a[i], so temp > a[i] would be false. So maybe these two blocks are mutually exclusive. But perhaps the code has a mistake here. But I'm not here to debug the Java code, just translate it.\n\nBut perhaps in the Java code, after the first if (temp < a[i]), then temp is set to a[i], and q is set to b[i]. Then, if the next condition is temp > a[i], which is possible if the first block wasn't entered (i.e., temp was not less than a[i], but perhaps greater than). Wait, maybe the code has a logic where temp is tracking the previous a[i] value. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the maximum a[i] in temp. Let's see: Initially, temp is 0. For each a[i], if a[i] is larger than temp, then temp becomes a[i], q becomes b[i]. Then, for the next a[i], if it's larger than temp (now a previous a[i]), etc. So temp would be the maximum a[i] encountered so far.\n\nBut then there's another part where if temp > a[i], then check if q < current b[i], etc. So maybe the code is checking if there exists a pair where a higher a has a lower b, which would mean that a higher price product has lower quality, hence \"Happy Alex\". So the code is looking for a case where there exists such a pair, and if found, f is set to true.\n\nBut perhaps the code's logic is not entirely correct. However, again, I'm just translating.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nVariables:\n\n- n: integer\n- a, b: arrays of integers, dimension(:), allocatable\n- temp, q, w, e: integers\n- f: logical\n\nInitialize:\n\ntemp = 0\nq = 0\nw = 0\ne = 0\nf = .false.\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to n.\n\nIn the loop, for each a(i) and b(i):\n\nCheck if temp < a(i). If so:\n\n   if (q > b(i)) then\n       f = .true.\n   end if\n   q = b(i)\n   temp = a(i)\n\nElse if temp > a(i) then:\n\n   if (q < b(i)) then\n       f = .true.\n   end if\n   q = b(i)\n   temp = a(i)\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the code after the first if block checks another if (temp > a[i]). So perhaps in Fortran, after the first if block, there's an else if. Wait, but in Java, the two blocks are separate ifs. So even if the first if is true, the second if is checked as well. So perhaps in Fortran, we need to have two separate if statements, not else if.\n\nWait, the Java code's first block is:\n\nif (temp < a[i]) { ... }\n\nthen the second block is:\n\nif (temp > a[i]) { ... }\n\nSo they are separate conditions. So even if the first condition is true, the second condition is still checked. For example, if temp is 5, and a[i] is 6, first block is entered. Then, after temp is set to 6, the second condition (6 > a[i]) is false. But if a[i] was 4, then the first condition is not entered, and the second condition (5>4) is checked.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code for these two blocks would be two separate if statements.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (temp < a(i)) then\n    if (q > b(i)) then\n        f = .true.\n    end if\n    q = b(i)\n    temp = a(i)\nend if\n\nif (temp > a(i)) then\n    if (q < b(i)) then\n        f = .true.\n    end if\n    q = b(i)\n    temp = a(i)\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the first if block, temp is updated to a[i], so the second if (temp > a[i]) can only be true if a[i] is less than the new temp (which is a[i]), which is impossible. So maybe the Java code's second block is redundant. Unless the code has a mistake. But again, I'm just translating.\n\nThen, after those, the code checks if a[i] > w. w is initialized to 0.\n\nIf a[i] > w:\n\n   if (b(i) < e), then f=true.\n\n   Then e is set to b[i], and w is set to a[i].\n\nThen, if a[i] < w:\n\n   if (b(i) > e), then f=true.\n\nSo similar structure. So in Fortran:\n\nif (a(i) > w) then\n    if (b(i) < e) then\n        f = .true.\n    end if\n    w = a(i)\n    e = b(i)\nend if\n\nif (a(i) < w) then\n    if (b(i) > e) then\n        f = .true.\n    end if\nend if\n\nAgain, two separate if statements.\n\nSo putting all that into Fortran.\n\nNow, for reading input:\n\nIn Java, the code reads n, then n pairs of a[i] and b[i].\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nRead *, n\n\nThen allocate a and b with size n.\n\nThen loop from i=1 to n:\n\n   read *, a(i), b(i)\n\nBut in Fortran, if the input is given as lines with two numbers each, then this would read them correctly.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nInitialize variables.\n\nThen loop through each i.\n\nIn Java, the variables temp, q, w, e are updated as per the current a[i] and b[i].\n\nNow, translating each part step by step.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. Fortran uses 1-based array indices unless specified otherwise. So in the loop, i ranges from 1 to n.\n\n2. Declaration of variables:\n\n   integer :: n, i, temp, q, w, e\n\n   integer, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n\n   logical :: f\n\n3. Allocating arrays:\n\n   read *, n\n\n   allocate(a(n), b(n))\n\n   do i = 1, n\n       read *, a(i), b(i)\n   end do\n\n4. Initializing variables:\n\n   temp = 0\n\n   q = 0\n\n   w = 0\n\n   e = 0\n\n   f = .false.\n\n5. Then the loop:\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n       ! first part with temp and a(i)\n\n       if (temp < a(i)) then\n           if (q > b(i)) then\n               f = .true.\n           end if\n           q = b(i)\n           temp = a(i)\n       end if\n\n       if (temp > a(i)) then\n           if (q < b(i)) then\n               f = .true.\n           end if\n           q = b(i)\n           temp = a(i)\n       end if\n\n       ! second part with w and a(i)\n\n       if (a(i) > w) then\n           if (b(i) < e) then\n               f = .true.\n           end if\n           w = a(i)\n           e = b(i)\n       end if\n\n       if (a(i) < w) then\n           if (b(i) > e) then\n               f = .true.\n           end if\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\nWait, but in Java, the code inside the loop is:\n\nif (a[i] > w) {\n    w = a[i];\n    if (b[i] < e) {\n        f = true;\n    }\n    e = b[i];\n}\n\nWait, the Java code's order is:\n\nAfter setting w to a[i], then check if b[i] < e (which was the previous e). Then set e to b[i]. So in Fortran, the code should be:\n\nif (a(i) > w) then\n    if (b(i) < e) then\n        f = .true.\n    end if\n    w = a(i)\n    e = b(i)\nend if\n\nBecause in Java, after the condition a[i] > w (w is previous max), then check if current b[i] is less than e (previous e). Then update w and e to current a and b.\n\nSo the code in Fortran for that part is correct as above.\n\nNow, after processing all elements, output \"Happy Alex\" if f is true, else \"Poor Alex\".\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nif (f) then\n    print *, \"Happy Alex\"\nelse\n    print *, \"Poor Alex\"\nend if\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, possible edge cases: n=0? But in the Java code, n is read via nextInt, which expects input. Assuming n >=1.\n\nTesting with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\nIn this case, the first pair (1,2), temp becomes 1, q=2. Then second pair (2,1): temp < a[i] (2>1), so check if q (2) > current b[i] (1). Yes, so f becomes true. Then q=1, temp=2.\n\nThen, in the second part, for the first pair, a[i] is 1 which is less than w (0 initially?), but initial w is 0. So first iteration, a[i] is 1>0, so check if b[i] (2) < e (0, since e is initialized to 0). 2 < 0 is false, so f remains. Then w becomes 1, e becomes 2. Next iteration, a[i] is 2>1: check if b[i] 1 < e (2) \u2192 yes. So f is set to true. Then w becomes 2, e becomes 1.\n\nSo overall, f is true, output \"Happy Alex\".\n\nThus, the Fortran code should replicate this logic.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nThe Fortran code would look like:\n\nprogram codeforces_456_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, temp, q, w, e\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n    logical :: f\n\n    read *, n\n    allocate(a(n), b(n))\n    do i = 1, n\n        read *, a(i), b(i)\n    end do\n\n    temp = 0\n    q = 0\n    w = 0\n    e = 0\n    f = .false.\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (temp < a(i)) then\n            if (q > b(i)) then\n                f = .true.\n            end if\n            q = b(i)\n            temp = a(i)\n        end if\n\n        if (temp > a(i)) then\n            if (q < b(i)) then\n                f = .true.\n            end if\n            q = b(i)\n            temp = a(i)\n        end if\n\n        if (a(i) > w) then\n            if (b(i) < e) then\n                f = .true.\n            end if\n            w = a(i)\n            e = b(i)\n        end if\n\n        if (a(i) < w) then\n            if (b(i) > e) then\n                f = .true.\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (f) then\n        print *, \"Happy Alex\"\n    else\n        print *, \"Poor Alex\"\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(a, b)\nend program codeforces_456_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the syntax requires that the parentheses are properly placed, and lines can't have certain syntax. Also, in the allocate statement, I wrote b(n)), which is a typo. Should be b(n).\n\nWait, the code has:\n\nallocate(a(n), b(n))\n\nBut in Fortran, the commas are correct. allocate(a(n), b(n)) is okay.\n\nOther possible issues: in the loop, when comparing temp < a(i), etc. Also, Fortran is case-insensitive, but variable names are in lower case here.\n\nTesting the code for syntax.\n\nYes, the code should be correct. Let me check:\n\n- The variables are declared properly.\n\n- The loops and conditionals are properly structured with end if, end do.\n\n- The read statements correctly read the input.\n\nYes, I think this should work."
