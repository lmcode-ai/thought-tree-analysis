    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. So, the program reads an integer n, then reads n integers into an array. Then it counts how many of them are even and odd. If there are more odd numbers, it prints the index of the even one (since there's only one even), otherwise it prints the index of the odd one. The indices in Java start at 1, which is important.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays can start at 1 by default, which matches here. So first, I need to read n, then read n integers into an array. Then loop through the array, checking each element modulo 2. Keep track of the counts and the indices.\n\nLet's start. In Fortran, the main program structure would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_25_A\n    implicit none\n    ! variable declarations\n    integer :: n, i\n    integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n    integer :: odd_count, even_count, odd_index, even_index\n\n    ! read input\n    read *, n\n    allocate(array(n))  ! Since Java uses array[1..n], Fortran can do the same.\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        read *, array(i)\n    end do\n\n    ! initialize counts\n    odd_count = 0\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_index = 0\n    even_index = 0\n\n    ! loop through the array\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (mod(array(i), 2) == 0) then\n            even_count = even_count + 1\n            even_index = i\n        else\n            odd_count = odd_count + 1\n            odd_index = i\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! determine which to print\n    if (odd_count > even_count) then\n        print *, even_index\n    else\n        print *, odd_index\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(array)\nend program codeforces_25_A\n\nWait, but in Java, the array is declared as size n+1, but indexes from 1 to n. Oh wait, in the Java code, the array is declared as new int[n+1], so the valid indexes are 1 to n. So in Fortran, declaring array(n) and using indices 1 to n is correct.\n\nWait, no. In Java, array indices start at 0. Wait, in the Java code, the array is initialized as new int[n+1], so the size is n+1 elements (0 to n). But in the code, the loop is from i=1 to n. So array[1] to array[n] are filled. So the Fortran array can be of size n, and use indices 1 to n. So in Fortran, when you allocate array(n), the default lower bound is 1. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\nRead n, then allocate array(n), then read n elements into array(1) to array(n).\n\nThen loop from 1 to n, check mod.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the modulo function is mod(a, b), and for even check, mod(array(i),2) ==0.\n\nThen, after counting, compare if odd_count is greater than even_count. If yes, print even_index, else print odd_index.\n\nSo that's the structure. Now, handling the input. In Java, the input is read via Scanner. In Fortran, we can read from standard input with read *, variables.\n\nEdge cases: For example, when all but one are even, etc. The code should handle that.\n\nPotential issues: Make sure that the array starts at 1. Also, in Fortran, when you allocate array(n), the indices are from 1 to n by default, right? Wait, in Fortran, arrays can start at 1 if declared as such. Wait, when you declare an array as integer, dimension(n) :: array, the default is index 1 to n. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: In Java, the initial array is of size n+1. But the loop is from 1 to n. So the code in Java uses indices 1..n, which corresponds to the Fortran array indices 1..n. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code should work. Let me check again.\n\nTesting with sample input. For example, sample input 1:\n\n5\n2 4 7 8 10\n\nThe array elements are 2,4,7,8,10. Then, the even counts are 4, odd count 1. So the code prints the odd index, which is 3.\n\nIn Fortran, after processing, odd_count is 1, even_count 4. Since 1 >4 is false, print odd_index (3).\n\nYes. So code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's write the Fortran code accordingly. The code structure should be correct. Let me write it properly with correct syntax.\n\nThings to note:\n\n- In Fortran, the modulo function returns a result with the same sign as the dividend. But since the array elements are integers, and even/odd checks are based on modulo 2, the sign doesn't matter here. So mod(array(i), 2) is sufficient.\n\n- Use implicit none.\n\n- Allocate and deallocate the array.\n\nPutting it all together."
