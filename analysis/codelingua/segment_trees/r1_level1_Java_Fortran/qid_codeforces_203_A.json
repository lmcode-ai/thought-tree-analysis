So in Fortran, the do loop for i would be do i = 0, t-1. But in Fortran, if t is zero, the loop would run from 0 to -1, which is not executed. So if t is zero, the loops are not entered, and ok remains false. But in Java, if t is zero, the loop i runs from 0 to t-1 (t is zero, so i < 0 is false, so loop does not execute. So same as Fortran. But what if t is zero? For example, the code checks x == 0. So if x is zero, then ok is true even if t is zero. So the code correctly outputs \"YES\" when x is zero, even if t is zero. But in the Java code, the loops are inside the code, so when t is zero, the loops are not entered, and the code checks if x is zero. But in the Fortran code, the same logic applies. So that's correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe code seems to check if a certain value x can be obtained by either one of two values, first and second, which decrease over time. The variables first and second are calculated in nested loops. For each time step i up to t, first is a minus da multiplied by i. Similarly, for each j up to t, second is b minus db multiplied by j. Then, it checks if the sum of first and second equals x, or if either of them individually equals x, or if x is zero. If any of these conditions are met, it sets ok to true.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let's think about the structure.\n\nFirst, in Java, the code reads input using BufferedReader and StringTokenizer. Fortran uses READ statements for input. The variables x, t, a, b, da, db are integers. So in Fortran, we can read them using a single READ statement.\n\nThen, the nested loops for i and j from 0 to t-1 (since Java's for loop is for (i=0; i < t; i++)). In Fortran, loops are typically written as do loops. So, the outer loop would be do i = 0, t-1, and similarly for j.\n\nInside the loops, compute first and second. Then check if their sum is x, or if either is x, or x is zero. If any condition is met, set a logical variable (say, ok) to .true. and exit the loops.\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have a direct break statement for nested loops. So when a condition is met, we need to exit both loops. Maybe using flags to exit the inner loop and then check in the outer loop.\n\nAlternatively, once ok is set to true, we can exit all loops. Let's structure it with loops and exit conditions.\n\nAnother thing: the Java code initializes ok as false. So in Fortran, we can have a logical variable ok initialized to .false.\n\nAlso, after the loops, print \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on ok.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input values x, t, a, b, da, db.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the order of reading is x, t, a, b, da, db. So in Fortran, we need to read them in the same order.\n\nSo, the code should have:\n\ninteger :: x, t, a, b, da, db\n\nread(*,*) x, t, a, b, da, db\n\nThen, initialize ok to .false.\n\nThen, loop i from 0 to t-1:\n\ndo i = 0, t-1\n\n   first = a - da * i\n\n   loop j from 0 to t-1:\n\n   do j = 0, t-1\n\n      second = b - db * j\n\n      if ( (second + first == x) .or. (second == x) .or. (first == x) .or. (x == 0) ) then\n\n          ok = .true.\n\n          exit\n\n      endif\n\n   end do\n\n   if (ok) exit\n\nend do\n\nThen, after the loops, if ok is true, print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nWait, but in Java, the loops go up to t, but with i < t. So i ranges from 0 to t-1 inclusive. So in Fortran, the loop would be from 0 to t-1. Same for j.\n\nAlso, in Java, if any of the conditions is met, it breaks out of the inner loop, then the outer loop continues. Wait, no: in Java, after setting ok to true, there's a break, which exits the inner loop. Then, the outer loop proceeds to the next i. But the code may have already found a solution, but the outer loop continues. Wait, no. Because in Java, once the inner loop breaks, the code checks the next i. So even if a solution is found, the code continues checking all possibilities. Wait, no: the code has \"break\" after setting ok = true, but the outer loop will keep running. So in Java, even after finding a solution, it continues checking other i and j. But in the Java code, once ok is set to true, the inner loop breaks, but the outer loop continues. Wait, but that's correct? Because once any of the conditions is met, the code sets ok to true, but doesn't exit the outer loop. So it's possible that the code continues checking even after finding a valid solution. But in the original code, that's okay because once ok is true, the answer is yes, so it's sufficient. So even if there are multiple possible solutions, once one is found, the answer is yes. So the code can exit early once a solution is found. However, the original Java code does not break out of the outer loop once ok is true. So it will continue all possible i and j until all possibilities are checked. Wait, but in the code, after the inner loop breaks, the outer loop continues to the next i. However, in Java, once ok becomes true, any further checks are redundant, but the code doesn't exit early. So the Java code's approach is inefficient but correct. \n\nSo, in Fortran, to replicate that, once ok is set to true in the inner loop, the inner loop exits (using exit), but the outer loop continues. However, perhaps we can optimize by exiting the outer loop once ok is true. So in Fortran, after exiting the inner loop, check if ok is true and exit the outer loop as well. That's what I have in the outline: after the inner loop, if ok is true, exit the outer loop. So the loops stop checking once a solution is found.\n\nSo that's better and more efficient.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the variables first and second can become negative. But the code doesn't check for that. So in Fortran, same as well.\n\nNow, handling the input and output.\n\nIn Java, the code uses a PrintWriter for output. In Fortran, we use print statements. So after determining ok, print \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the Fortran code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: x, t, a, b, da, db\n    integer :: i, j, first, second\n    logical :: ok\n\n    read(*,*) x, t, a, b, da, db\n\n    ok = .false.\n\n    do i = 0, t-1\n        first = a - da * i\n        do j = 0, t-1\n            second = b - db * j\n            if ( (first + second == x) .or. (second == x) .or. (first == x) .or. (x == 0) ) then\n                ok = .true.\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (ok) exit\n    end do\n\n    if (ok) then\n        print *, \"YES\"\n    else\n        print *, \"NO\"\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop runs for i from 0 to t-1 inclusive. So in Fortran, the do loop for i would be do i = 0, t-1. But in Fortran, if t is zero, the loop would run from 0 to -1, which is not executed. So if t is zero, the loops are not entered, and ok remains false. But in Java, if t is zero, the loop i runs from 0 to t-1 (t is zero, so i < 0 is false, so loop does not execute. So same as Fortran.\n\nBut what if t is zero? For example, the code checks x == 0. So if x is zero, then ok is true even if t is zero. So the code correctly outputs \"YES\" when x is zero, even if t is zero.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loops are inside the code, so when t is zero, the loops are not entered, and the code checks if x is zero. But in the Fortran code, the same logic applies. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in Java, if t is zero, the loops are not entered, but the code checks if x is zero, which is handled in the condition. So the Fortran code should have the same logic.\n\nWait, in the code, the condition includes x ==0. So even if the loops are not entered, if x is zero, the code will output yes. But in the code, the loops are part of the condition. Wait, in Java, the code checks (second + first == x) || (second ==x) || (first ==x) || (x ==0). So even if the loops are not entered (t is zero), then first and second are not computed. But then, in the code, the condition is never checked, so the x==0 is not considered. Wait, no. Because the loops are not entered, so the code inside the loops is not executed. So the code inside the loops checks if x is zero. So if the loops are not executed (t is zero), then the code never checks if x is zero. Wait, this is a bug in the original Java code.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The Java code's loops run from i=0 to t-1. So if t is zero, the loops don't run. So the code inside the loops is never executed. So the code inside the loops checks for x ==0. So if x is zero, but t is zero, the code would not detect it. But in the code's condition, x==0 is inside the loop. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, but the original code's logic may have a bug. Because if t is zero, the loops are not executed, so the code does not check for x==0. But in the Java code, the loop runs for i in 0 to t-1. If t is zero, the loop is not entered. So the code's condition is only checked inside the loops. So if t is zero, but x is zero, the code would not output yes. But according to the problem statement (assuming the problem allows t=0), then x=0 would not be handled. But perhaps in the problem, t is supposed to be positive. But the code as written may have a bug here.\n\nWait, let's look at the original code. The Java code's loops are for (int i = 0; i < t; i++). So if t is zero, the loop runs zero times. So in that case, the code never checks any of the conditions. So even if x is zero, but t is zero, the code would output no. But according to the problem's logic, perhaps when t is zero, then the initial points (a and b) have been reduced by da*0 and db*0, which are a and b. But maybe the problem expects that when t is zero, the values are not available. So perhaps the original code's logic is correct.\n\nBut that's a potential problem. However, since I'm translating the code as is, I should replicate that logic. So in the Fortran code, the x==0 is only checked inside the loops. So if the loops are not entered (t=0), then x=0 would not be considered. So the Fortran code should replicate this behavior.\n\nBut in the original code, if x is zero and the loops are entered (t>0), then it would detect it. Otherwise, if t=0, then x=0 would not be detected.\n\nSo the Fortran code will have the same behavior as the Java code. Therefore, the translation is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: in Fortran, the variables first and second are computed as a - da*i and b - db*j. Since i and j start from 0. So same as Java.\n\nNow, let's test with some sample inputs.\n\nFor example, if x=0, t=1:\n\nIn Java, i runs 0. j runs 0. first = a - da*0 =a. second = b - db*0 =b.\n\nCondition: a +b ==0, or a ==0, or b ==0, or x==0. So since x is 0, the condition is true. So output is YES.\n\nIn Fortran, same result.\n\nAnother test case: x=5, t=1, a=5, b=0, da=0, db=0. Then i=0, first=5. j=0, second=0. Then 5+0=5 ==x, so output YES.\n\nAnother test case where x is zero but t=0. Then loops are not entered, so ok remains false. So output is NO, even though x is zero. Which is the same as the Java code.\n\nSo the translation is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should look like the outline I wrote."
