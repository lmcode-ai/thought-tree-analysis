    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads five long integers: Q, H, S, D, N. Then it calculates the minimum price for one liter. The one liter price is the minimum of Q*4, H*2, and S. Then, it checks if this onePrice is cheaper than half of D. If so, it just multiplies onePrice by N. Otherwise, it uses as many D (which is for 2 liters) as possible, and the remainder is covered by onePrice.\n\nSo, the main steps are reading inputs, calculating the one-liter cost, comparing with D/2, and then outputting the total cost.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's recall Fortran's syntax. Variables in Fortran need to be declared. The data types: integers would be INTEGER(8) perhaps, since Java uses long. But maybe in Fortran, depending on the compiler, we can just use INTEGER*8 or INTEGER(KIND=8). Let's go with INTEGER*8 for all variables to handle large numbers like Java's long.\n\nInput in Fortran is done using READ(*,*) which reads from standard input. Output is done with WRITE(*,*).\n\nSo, first, declare variables Q, H, S, D, N, onePrice, total, etc. Wait, in the Java code, all variables are of type long. So in Fortran, they should be 8-byte integers.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Declare variables Q, H, S, D, N, onePrice as INTEGER*8.\n2. Read the five values from input in order.\n3. Compute onePrice as the minimum of Q*4, H*2, and S.\n4. Compare if onePrice is less than or equal to D/2. But since D is integer, D/2 in Java would be integer division. Wait, in Java, when you divide a long by 2, it's integer division. However, in the Java code, the comparison is done using (double) onePrice <= (double) D / 2. So this is comparing floating points. For example, if D is 3, D/2 is 1.5, and if onePrice is 1, then 1 <= 1.5 is true.\n\nSo in Fortran, to replicate this, perhaps we should compare onePrice <= (D / 2.0). But since D is an integer, D / 2.0 is a real value. So converting both to real numbers for the comparison.\n\nWait, but in Java, (double) D / 2 is equivalent to D / 2.0. So in Fortran, we can compute D / 2.0 and compare it with onePrice.\n\nSo the condition in Fortran would be: onePrice <= (D / 2.0d0). Since we want to use double precision for the division.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, if D is an integer, D / 2.0d0 would be a double precision real. So comparing an integer (onePrice) to a real. That's allowed; Fortran will convert the integer to a real for the comparison.\n\nSo if onePrice is less than or equal to D/2.0, then the total is N * onePrice. Else, the total is (N//2)*D + mod(N,2)*onePrice.\n\nSo for the else case, integer division and modulus.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nIF (onePrice <= (D / 2.0d0)) THEN\n    total = N * onePrice\nELSE\n    total = (N / 2) * D + MOD(N, 2) * onePrice\nEND IF\n\nWait, but in Java, N is a long, and division of two longs is integer division. So in Fortran, when N is even, N/2 is straightforward. But in Fortran, the division of integers uses truncation towards zero, same as Java. So that's okay.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nPROGRAM atcoder_AGC019_A\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER*8 :: Q, H, S, D, N\nINTEGER*8 :: onePrice, total\n\nREAD(*,*) Q, H, S, D, N\n\nonePrice = MIN(MIN(Q*4, H*2), S)\n\nIF (onePrice <= (D / 2.0d0)) THEN\n    total = N * onePrice\nELSE\n    total = (N / 2) * D + MOD(N, 2) * onePrice\nEND IF\n\nWRITE(*,*) total\n\nEND PROGRAM atcoder_AGC019_A\n\nWait, but D is an integer, so D/2.0d0 is a real. So comparing onePrice (integer) to a real. That's okay in Fortran. But in the case where D is an odd number, like 3, D/2.0d0 is 1.5, and if onePrice is 1, then the condition is true. Which matches the Java code.\n\nTesting this logic. For example, in Java, if D is 3, then (double) D /2 is 1.5. So if onePrice is 1, the condition is true, so total is N*1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work. Now, possible edge cases: N even or odd. For example, when N is 3, and the else case is taken, (3//2)=1, MOD(3,2)=1. So 1*D +1*onePrice.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo the code should be as written above. Need to check the syntax. For example, in Fortran, variable declarations, and using .0d0 for double precision. The MIN function can take multiple arguments as MIN(a, b, c). Wait, in Fortran, the MIN function takes two arguments, but you can chain them. Wait, no. Wait, in Fortran, the MIN function can take any number of arguments. So MIN(Q*4, H*2, S) would be okay. Wait, but in Fortran 77, MIN requires at least two arguments. So perhaps in modern Fortran, it's allowed. Let me check.\n\nYes, in Fortran 90 and later, MIN can take multiple arguments. So MIN(Q*4, H*2, S) is valid. So that line should work.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
