    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's look at the original Java code first. The main class reads a string from the input, checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B', and prints \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nFirst, I remember that Fortran uses a different structure. The program starts with a program block. For reading input, Fortran uses READ statements. But how to read a string from standard input?\n\nIn Java, the code uses Scanner's next() method to get the input string. In Fortran, I can declare a character variable, say, 's', and read it with READ(*,*) s. Wait, but Fortran might require specifying the length. So maybe declare it as CHARACTER(len=3) :: s since the input is a 3-letter string. Wait, the problem statement's input is probably a string of two stations, but maybe the example uses 3 letters? Wait, the original Java code just checks if the string contains both A and B. So the input could be any length, but perhaps the problem expects a 3-character string. But the Java code doesn't specify a length, so perhaps in the problem, the input is a string S of exactly three characters. Let me check the original problem. Oh, the problem is A Station and Bus from ABC158 A. The problem statement says: \"The string S consists of uppercase English letters and has a length of 3 characters.\" So the input is exactly 3 characters. So in Fortran, the variable should be declared as CHARACTER(3) :: s.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the string s of length 3.\n2. Check if s contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n3. Print \"Yes\" if both are present, else \"No\".\n\nIn Fortran, how to check if a string contains both characters? Well, we can loop through each character and check, or use the INDEX function. INDEX(s, 'A') returns the position of 'A' in s, and if it's greater than 0, then 'A' is present. Similarly for 'B'.\n\nSo the logic would be:\n\nif ( (index(s, 'A') > 0) .and. (index(s, 'B') > 0) ) then\n    print *, \"Yes\"\nelse\n    print *, \"No\"\nendif\n\nBut wait, the Java code uses contains, which is case-sensitive. Since the problem says S consists of uppercase letters, that's fine. So in Fortran, the same approach works.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program would read the string, check for presence of both characters, and output accordingly.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(3) :: s\n    read(*,*) s\n    if (index(s, 'A') > 0 .and. index(s, 'B') > 0) then\n        print *, \"Yes\"\n    else\n        print *, \"No\"\n    end if\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the index function returns 0 if the substring is not found. So checking if both are greater than 0 is correct.\n\nTesting with sample inputs:\n\nFor example, if input is \"ABA\", then index('A') is 1, index('B') is 2. So yes.\n\nIf input is \"BBB\", then index('A') is 0, so output is no.\n\nIf input is \"AAB\", then both are present, output yes.\n\nSo this logic should work.\n\nI think that's all. The Fortran code should be straightforward. The main thing is reading the input correctly as a 3-character string and using the index function to check presence."
