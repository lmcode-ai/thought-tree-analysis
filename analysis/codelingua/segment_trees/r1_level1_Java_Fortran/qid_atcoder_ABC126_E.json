To do that, in Fortran:\n\ntype :: UnionFindTree\n    integer :: n\n    integer, allocatable :: par(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: rank(:)\nend type\n\nThen, in the init subroutine:\n\nsubroutine init_union_find(utf, n)\n    type(UnionFindTree), intent(out) :: utf\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n    integer :: i\n\n    utf%n = n\n    allocate(utf%par(0:n-1))\n    allocate(utf%rank(0:n-1)) do i = 0, n-1\n        utf%par(i) = i\n        utf%rank(i) = 0\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nYes, that's possible. So the par array is 0-based. So when the input is read, x and y are read as 1-based (since the problem's input is 1-based), and then subtracted by 1 to get 0-based indices. But wait, in the Java code, x and y are read as 1-based (since the input is 1-based, then subtracted by 1 to get 0-based). So in the Fortran code, after reading x and y, subtract 1 to make them 0-based, same as Java. But in Fortran, when you read x, y, z from the input (which is 1-based), you subtract 1 to get x and y as 0-based. But in the code above, when reading x, y, z, the code does:\n\nread(*, *) x, y, z\nx = x - 1\ny = y - 1\n\nYes. So the main program's loop is:\n\ndo i = 1, m\n    read(*, *) x, y, z\n    x = x - 1\n    y = y - 1\n    call unite(utf, x, y)\nend do\n\nThen, after processing all m edges, the code counts the number of roots (par[i] == i) from 0 to n-1. So the loop in the main program is:\n\ncnt = 0\ndo i = 0, n-1\n    if (utf%par(i) == i) then\n        cnt = cnt + 1\n    end if\nend do\nprint *, cnt\n\nNow, putting all together.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first. The main class is atcoder_ABC126_E, which has a doIt method. The key part here is the UnionFindTree class. Fortran doesn't have classes in the same way as Java, so I'll have to use modules and derived types to replicate the structure.\n\nFirst, the UnionFindTree in Java has arrays for parent (par) and rank. In Fortran, I can create a derived type called UnionFindTree with components: n, par array, and rank array. Then, I'll need to write procedures for initializing the union-find structure, finding the root, and uniting two elements.\n\nIn Java, the main method reads input using Scanner. Fortran uses read statements, so I'll need to read n and m from standard input. Then, for each m entries, read x, y, z, but z isn't used except for uniting x and y. So in Fortran, we can read those three variables and ignore z.\n\nThe main part is counting the number of root nodes. So after processing all unions, iterate through each node and check if it's its own parent. The count of such nodes is the answer.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Create a module for the UnionFindTree. The module will contain the derived type and the methods (find, unite, etc.). Since Fortran doesn't support methods inside the derived type directly, I'll have to use subroutines that take the UnionFindTree instance as an argument.\n\n2. The UnionFindTree derived type will have n, par, and rank as components. The par and rank arrays are allocated based on the size n.\n\n3. The init subroutine will initialize par as each element pointing to itself and rank as zero.\n\n4. The find function will implement path compression. In Java, it's recursive, but for efficiency, Fortran might need an iterative approach. Wait, looking at the Java code, the find function uses path compression by setting par[x] to the root during the find. So in Fortran, the find function can be a recursive function. Wait, but Fortran doesn't handle recursion as smoothly as Java, especially for functions. Alternatively, implement it iteratively.\n\nWait, the Java code's find function is:\n\nint find(int x) {\n    if (par[x] == x) {\n        return x;\n    } else {\n        return par[x] = find(par[x]);\n    }\n}\n\nThis is the path compression where each node's parent is updated to the root as we go up. So in Fortran, for the find function, we can do it recursively, but Fortran functions can't modify their arguments unless they are passed as intent(inout). But in this case, the UnionFindTree instance's par array needs to be modified. So perhaps the find function needs to be a subroutine that takes the UnionFindTree, x, and returns the root, while also updating the par array.\n\nAlternatively, create a function that, given the UnionFindTree, and x, returns the root and updates the par array. But in Fortran, functions can't modify their arguments unless they are intent(inout). So maybe a subroutine is better here.\n\nLet me think. The find operation needs to modify the parent array when path compression happens. So the find function (as a subroutine) would take the UnionFindTree instance, x, and return the root. Then, during the find, it recursively finds the root of x's parent and updates x's parent to the root.\n\nBut recursion in Fortran can be tricky. Let's see. The Java code uses recursion for path compression. Let's try to translate that into a Fortran subroutine.\n\nWait, perhaps the find function can be written as a recursive function. But Fortran functions can be recursive if they are declared as such. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe an iterative approach is better here to avoid stack overflow for large n.\n\nLet me think about the iterative approach. For find(x):\n\nWhile x is not its own parent, we follow the parent pointers. But then we need to do path compression by updating the parent of each node along the path to the root. Hmm. Alternatively, in the iterative approach, first find the root, then traverse the path again to set each node's parent to the root. That's one way to do path compression.\n\nSo:\n\nfunction find(utf, x) result(root)\n    type(UnionFindTree), intent(inout) :: utf\n    integer, intent(in) :: x\n    integer :: root, current, parent\n\n    current = x\n    do while (utf%par(current) /= current)\n        current = utf%par(current)\n    end do\n    root = current\n\n    ! Now do path compression\n    current = x\n    do while (current /= root)\n        parent = utf%par(current)\n        utf%par(current) = root\n        current = parent\n    end do\nend function\n\nThis way, the find is done iteratively, and path compression is applied. This might be more efficient and avoid recursion limits.\n\nSo perhaps the find subroutine is better implemented this way.\n\nNow, the unite subroutine. In Java, unite(x, y) finds the roots of x and y. If they are the same, do nothing. Else, compare ranks and attach the smaller rank tree under the higher rank. If ranks are equal, increment the rank of the new root.\n\nSo in Fortran, the unite subroutine will:\n\n1. Call find on x and y to get their roots, with path compression.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when you call find(x), it returns the root and updates the par array. So in Fortran, the find subroutine would need to modify the UnionFindTree's par array. So the find function (or subroutine) must take the UnionFindTree as an intent(inout) argument.\n\nSo, perhaps in Fortran:\n\nsubroutine unite(utf, x, y)\n    type(UnionFindTree), intent(inout) :: utf\n    integer, intent(in) :: x, y\n    integer :: x_root, y_root\n\n    call find(utf, x, x_root)\n    call find(utf, y, y_root)\n\n    if (x_root == y_root) return\n\n    if (utf%rank(x_root) < utf%rank(y_root)) then\n        utf%par(x_root) = y_root\n    else\n        utf%par(y_root) = x_root\n        if (utf%rank(x_root) == utf%rank(y_root)) then\n            utf%rank(x_root) = utf%rank(x_root) + 1\n        end if\n    end if\nend subroutine\n\nAnd the find subroutine would be:\n\nsubroutine find(utf, x, root)\n    type(UnionFindTree), intent(inout) :: utf\n    integer, intent(in) :: x\n    integer, intent(out) :: root\n    integer :: current, parent\n\n    current = x\n    do while (utf%par(current) /= current)\n        current = utf%par(current)\n    end do\n    root = current\n\n    ! Path compression\n    current = x\n    do while (current /= root)\n        parent = utf%par(current)\n        utf%par(current) = root\n        current = parent\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in the path compression step, for the loop where current starts at x, then we check if current is not root, then get parent, set current's par to root, then current becomes parent. This loop will traverse from x up to root, updating each node's parent to root. This is the iterative way to do path compression.\n\nNow, the main program.\n\nIn Java, the main method creates an instance of atcoder_ABC126_E and calls doIt(). The doIt method reads n and m, initializes the UnionFindTree with size n, then processes m edges. Then counts the number of roots (where par[i] == i) and prints that.\n\nIn Fortran, the program structure would be:\n\n- Module for UnionFindTree, containing the derived type and subroutines (init, find, unite).\n\n- Main program that reads n and m, creates a UnionFindTree instance, processes m edges, then counts roots.\n\nSo in the main program:\n\nprogram main\n    use union_find_module\n    implicit none\n    type(UnionFindTree) :: utf\n    integer :: n, m, i, x, y, z, cnt\n\n    read(*, *) n, m\n    call init_union_find(utf, n)\n\n    do i = 1, m\n        read(*, *) x, y, z\n        x = x - 1  ! because Java uses 0-based, Fortran is 1-based here?\n        y = y - 1\n        call unite(utf, x, y)\n    end do\n\n    cnt = 0\n    do i = 0, n-1  ! assuming 0-based indices\n        if (utf%par(i) == i) then\n            cnt = cnt + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, cnt\nend program\n\nWait, but in Java, the code reads x, y, z, and then subtracts 1 from x and y (to make 0-based indices). In Fortran, when reading x and y, if the input is 1-based (like the original problem's input), then after reading x and y, we subtract 1 to make them 0-based for the union find structure. But in Fortran, arrays are usually 1-based, but the code here uses 0-based because the Java code uses 0-based.\n\nSo when creating the UnionFindTree in Fortran, the par and rank arrays should be 0-based. So, when allocating par and rank, for size n, indexes 0 to n-1.\n\nIn Fortran, by default, arrays are 1-based. So if we have:\n\nallocate(par(0:n-1), rank(0:n-1))\n\nThen, the code can use 0-based indices.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you allocate an array with (n), it starts at 1. So to create 0-based arrays, we can do:\n\npar = [integer:: ( (i, i=0, n-1) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps the init_union_find subroutine will initialize par as 0-based.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the UnionFindTree is initialized with par[i] = i for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nSo in Fortran, the par array should be 0-based. So when initializing, for i from 0 to n-1, par(i) = i.\n\nBut Fortran's arrays are 1-based by default. So perhaps when creating the par array, we can adjust the indices.\n\nWait, the code can have par as an array from 0 to n-1. To do that, in Fortran:\n\ntype :: UnionFindTree\n    integer :: n\n    integer, allocatable :: par(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: rank(:)\nend type\n\nThen, in the init subroutine:\n\nsubroutine init_union_find(utf, n)\n    type(UnionFindTree), intent(out) :: utf\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n    integer :: i\n\n    utf%n = n\n    allocate(utf%par(0:n-1))\n    allocate(utf%rank(0:n-1))\n    do i = 0, n-1\n        utf%par(i) = i\n        utf%rank(i) = 0\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nYes, that's possible. So the par array is 0-based. So when the input is read, x and y are read as 1-based (since the problem's input is 1-based), and then subtracted by 1 to get 0-based indices.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, x and y are read as 1-based (since the input is 1-based, then subtracted by 1 to get 0-based). So in the Fortran code, after reading x and y, subtract 1 to make them 0-based, same as Java.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read x, y, z from the input (which is 1-based), you subtract 1 to get x and y as 0-based.\n\nBut in the code above, when reading x, y, z, the code does:\n\nread(*, *) x, y, z\nx = x - 1\ny = y - 1\n\nYes.\n\nSo the main program's loop is:\n\ndo i = 1, m\n    read(*, *) x, y, z\n    x = x - 1\n    y = y - 1\n    call unite(utf, x, y)\nend do\n\nThen, after processing all m edges, the code counts the number of roots (par[i] == i) from 0 to n-1.\n\nSo the loop in the main program is:\n\ncnt = 0\ndo i = 0, n-1\n    if (utf%par(i) == i) then\n        cnt = cnt + 1\n    end if\nend do\nprint *, cnt\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran code will have:\n\nA module for UnionFindTree, which includes the derived type, init_union_find, find, unite subroutines.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. Fortran is case-insensitive. So variables like 'par' and 'rank' should be lowercase.\n\n2. Allocatable arrays need to be properly allocated and deallocated. But in this case, the program is short, so deallocation is not necessary.\n\n3. The find subroutine's path compression must correctly modify the par array.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nLet's see. For example, if n=3, m=1, and the edges are (1,2,0). Then after processing, the count is 2?\n\nWait, the code counts the number of root nodes, which is the number of connected components.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nFirst, the module:\n\nmodule union_find\n    implicit none\n    type UnionFindTree\n        integer :: n\n        integer, allocatable :: par(:)\n        integer, allocatable :: rank(:)\n    end type\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine init_union_find(utf, n)\n        type(UnionFindTree), intent(out) :: utf\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        integer :: i\n\n        utf%n = n\n        allocate(utf%par(0:n-1))\n        allocate(utf%rank(0:n-1))\n        do i = 0, n-1\n            utf%par(i) = i\n            utf%rank(i) = 0\n        end do\n    end subroutine\n\n    recursive subroutine find(utf, x, root)\n        type(UnionFindTree), intent(inout) :: utf\n        integer, intent(in) :: x\n        integer, intent(out) :: root\n        integer :: current, parent\n\n        current = x\n        do while (utf%par(current) /= current)\n            current = utf%par(current)\n        end do\n        root = current\n\n        !

Wait no, in Fortran 90 and later, /= is the same as .ne. So that's okay.\n\nBut the syntax is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the unite subroutine, after finding x_root and y_root, when comparing ranks.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nFor example, input:\n\n3 1\n1 2 0\n\nAfter reading, x=0, y=1. Unite 0 and 1. The roots are 0 and 1. Since ranks are 0, the parent of 1 becomes 0, and the rank of 0 becomes 1. Then, the count would be 2 (nodes 0 and 2 are roots). So output is 2.\n\nAnother test case: 3 0. Output is 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=2, edges (1-2, 2-3). Output is 1.\n\nThis code should handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The Fortran code uses 0-based arrays. Need to make sure that the par array is allocated from 0 to n-1.\n\nYes, in the init_union_find subroutine, the par and rank arrays are allocated as 0:n-1.\n\nAnother possible problem is when reading the input. For example, if the input has m lines, each with x, y, z, but z is ignored.\n\nIn Fortran, when using read(*, *) x, y, z, it will read three integers from the line, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think this code should work."
