    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main part is in the BUnhappyHackingABCEdit class's solve method. The program reads a string, processes each character. For '0' or '1', it appends them to a buffer. For 'B', it removes the last character if possible. Finally, it prints the buffer.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I need to replicate this behavior. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, reading the input string. In Java, they read using a LightScanner which reads a token. In Fortran, I can read the entire line as a string. So, perhaps read the input line into a variable.\n\nNext, process each character. In Fortran, I can loop through each character in the string. Then, for each character, check if it's '0', '1', or 'B'.\n\nFor handling the dynamic string buffer, Java uses a StringBuilder. In Fortran, since strings are fixed-length, but we can use a character array or a variable that we manipulate. Alternatively, use a list-like approach by appending characters to an array and keeping track of the current length.\n\nWait, Fortran has allocatable characters, which can be dynamically resized. So perhaps start with an empty string, and when appending, concatenate the character. For the backspace 'B' case, if the string isn't empty, remove the last character.\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are not as flexible as Java's StringBuilder. So, let's see. For example, if we have a string buffer that starts as empty. Then, for each character in the input:\n\n- If it's '0' or '1', append to buffer.\n- If it's 'B', remove the last character (if possible).\n\nSo, how to handle the buffer. Let's consider using a character array of sufficient length. Let's say the maximum possible length is the same as the input length, but maybe better to use a dynamic approach.\n\nAlternatively, use an allocatable character variable, and each time append or shorten it.\n\nBut in Fortran, manipulating strings can be a bit tricky. Let me think. For example:\n\nInitialize an empty string. Then, for each character in the input:\n\nCase 1: character is '0' or '1': buffer = trim(buffer) // c (assuming c is the current character). Wait, trim removes trailing spaces. Hmm, but maybe leading spaces are an issue? Or perhaps the buffer is built without spaces. Alternatively, use a list of characters.\n\nAlternatively, use a dynamic array of characters. Let's consider using a character array, with a pointer or an allocatable array.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to pre-allocate a buffer with a maximum possible size (like the input length) and track the current length. Let's see.\n\nSuppose the input is s. Let's get the length of s, say len_s. Then the maximum possible buffer length is len_s. So, create an array (or a string) of that size. Then, track the current position.\n\nInitialize current_length = 0.\n\nLoop over each character in s:\n\nIf the character is '0' or '1':\n\n   current_length = current_length + 1\n\n   buffer(current_length:current_length) = c\n\nElse if character is 'B' and current_length > 0:\n\n   current_length = current_length - 1\n\nAt the end, the result is buffer(1:current_length).\n\nYes, this seems manageable.\n\nIn Fortran, we can handle this with a character array. Let's code that.\n\nNow, steps:\n\n1. Read the input string. Since the Java code reads a token (using StringTokenizer), which suggests that the input is a single token (no spaces). So in Fortran, read a line, perhaps using read(*, '(a)') s. Then, trim it to remove any leading/trailing spaces.\n\nWait, but in Java's LightScanner, the string() method returns the next token, which is split by whitespace. So the input is a single token, which is the entire string. So in Fortran, the input is read as a single line, but perhaps leading/trailing spaces are not part of the input. So perhaps read the entire line and then trim leading/trailing whitespaces.\n\nAlternatively, just read the entire line. Let's see. So in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(1000) :: input_line\nread(*, '(a)') input_line\ninput_line = adjustl(input_line)  ! Removes leading spaces, but maybe not necessary.\n\nBut the maximum length is arbitrary. Let's assume the input line is up to, say, 1000 characters. Then process each character in input_line, up to len_trim(input_line).\n\nBut how to handle each character. Loop from 1 to len_trim(input_line), get each character.\n\nThen, for the buffer. Let's create a buffer with the same maximum length as input_line, so:\n\ncharacter(len=len_trim(input_line)) :: buffer\ninteger :: current_length\n\ncurrent_length = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(input_line)\n    c = input_line(i:i)\n    select case (c)\n    case ('0', '1')\n        current_length = current_length + 1\n        buffer(current_length:current_length) = c\n    case ('B')\n        if (current_length > 0) then\n            current_length = current_length - 1\n        end if\n    end select\nend do\n\nThen, the output is buffer(1:current_length).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, if buffer is declared as a fixed-length character variable, then if the input is longer than the declared length, there's a problem. Wait, no. Suppose input_line is 1000 characters. Then, len_trim(input_line) could be up to 1000. So buffer can be declared as a character(1000) variable. Then, as we process each character, we track current_length up to 1000.\n\nBut how to handle variable input lengths. Maybe using an allocatable character variable. Wait, but Fortran 2003 allows deferred-length character variables. So perhaps:\n\ncharacter(:), allocatable :: buffer\ninteger :: max_length\n\ninput_line = ... (read and trimmed)\nmax_length = len_trim(input_line)\nallocate(character(max_length) :: buffer)\ncurrent_length = 0\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nBut then, after processing, the result is buffer(1:current_length), which is a substring. Then, print that substring.\n\nAlternatively, use an array of characters. But in Fortran, a character variable is a scalar, so each position is a single character. So the approach above should work.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, handling input and output. The Java code reads from stdin and writes to stdout. So in Fortran, read from standard input, process, and write to standard output.\n\nPotential code structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(1000) :: input_line\n    character(:), allocatable :: buffer\n    integer :: i, current_length, max_length\n    character :: c\n\n    ! Read input line\n    read(*, '(a)') input_line\n    input_line = adjustl(input_line)  ! Remove leading spaces, but maybe not necessary\n    max_length = len_trim(input_line)\n\n    ! Allocate buffer\n    if (max_length > 0) then\n        allocate(character(max_length) :: buffer)\n    else\n        allocate(character(1) :: buffer) ! Handle empty input case\n    end if\n\n    current_length = 0\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(input_line)\n        c = input_line(i:i)\n        select case (c)\n        case ('0', '1')\n            current_length = current_length + 1\n            buffer(current_length:current_length) = c\n        case ('B')\n            if (current_length > 0) then\n                current_length = current_length - 1\n            end if\n        end select\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    if (current_length > 0) then\n        print '(a)', buffer(1:current_length)\n    else\n        print '(a)', ''\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, if the buffer is allocated with length max_length, but after processing, current_length could be less. So when we take buffer(1:current_length), that's the desired output.\n\nBut what if the input is empty? The code handles that with the allocation. If max_length is zero (i.e., input_line is all spaces or empty), then the else clause allocates a buffer of length 1, but current_length would be zero, so the output is empty.\n\nBut wait, if input_line is empty, then len_trim(input_line) is zero. So the code would enter the else clause, allocate buffer as length 1, but in the loop from 1 to 0 (since len_trim is zero), the loop doesn't execute. Then current_length remains zero, and the code prints buffer(1:0), which is an empty string. However, in Fortran, substring references like (1:0) are allowed and result in an empty string. So that should be okay.\n\nTesting some cases:\n\nTest case 1: Input is \"01B0\"\n\nProcessing:\n\n0: append, current_length 1\n\n1: append, current_length 2\n\nB: subtract 1, current_length 1\n\n0: append, current_length 2. So buffer is '00'.\n\nResult: \"00\"\n\nTest case 2: Input is \"B\"\n\nProcessing: B, but current_length is 0. No change. Output is empty.\n\nTest case 3: Input is \"0BB\". \n\nFirst 0: current_length 1. Then B: 0. Then B: no change. Output is empty.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n- Handling empty input: as discussed.\n\n- Input with leading or trailing spaces: the Java code's LightScanner reads a token (split by whitespace), so the input is a single token. So in Fortran, perhaps the input line is read and then leading/trailing whitespace is removed. Wait, but the code uses input_line = adjustl(input_line), which removes leading spaces. But the Java code uses nextToken(), which splits on any whitespace and returns the next token. So in the Java code, the input is a single token, so the input in Fortran should read a line and take the first token. Oh wait, no. The Java code reads the entire line as a token. Because the LightScanner's string() method reads the next token, which is the entire next token from the input. So for example, if the input is \"  ab c  \", then the tokenizer would get \"ab\" first, then \"c\".\n\nWait, no. The StringTokenizer in Java by default splits on whitespace, and the nextToken() returns the next sequence of non-whitespace characters. So, in the Java code, when the code calls in.string(), it's reading the next token, which is the next sequence of non-whitespace characters. So, leading whitespaces are skipped, and the input is the first token. So in Fortran, the code should read the first token from the input line.\n\nBut how to read a token in Fortran. Hmm. Fortran's read statement can read tokens separated by spaces. For example, if the input line is \"  abc B 0 \", then the first token would be \"abc\".\n\nBut the original Java code's input is the entire input line as a single token, which may contain 'B's and others. Wait, no: the Java code's LightScanner's string() method reads the next token. So if the input line is, say, \"B0 1B\", then the first call to in.string() returns \"B0\", the next returns \"1B\", etc. But in the code provided, the solver reads s = in.string(), which is the entire input as one token. So, the code is designed to process a single token, which is the entire input string (without leading or trailing whitespace, and no internal whitespace).\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code should read the first token from the input line. So perhaps read the input using list-directed input (i.e., read(*,*) input_line), which will read the first token, ignoring leading whitespace and stopping at the first whitespace.\n\nBut the Java code's input could have multiple lines, but in this case, the code reads a single token. So in Fortran, to replicate this, read the first token.\n\nSo changing the read statement in Fortran to:\n\nread(*, *) input_line\n\nThis reads the first token from the input line, ignoring leading spaces. The rest of the line is ignored, which may not match if the input has multiple tokens. But according to the problem's code, the Java code reads a single token, so the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nTherefore, the code should use read(*, *) input_line to read the first token.\n\nBut then, the input_line may have trailing spaces if the token is shorter than the declared length (1000). So len_trim(input_line) gives the actual length of the token.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(1000) :: input_line\n    character(:), allocatable :: buffer\n    integer :: i, current_length, max_length\n    character :: c\n\n    ! Read input token\n    read(*, *) input_line\n    input_line = trim(input_line)  ! Remove trailing spaces\n    max_length = len(input_line)\n\n    ! Allocate buffer\n    allocate(character(max_length) :: buffer)\n    current_length = 0\n\n    do i = 1, max_length\n        c = input_line(i:i)\n        select case (c)\n        case ('0', '1')\n            current_length = current_length + 1\n            buffer(current_length:current_length) = c\n        case ('B')\n            if (current_length > 0) then\n                current_length = current_length - 1\n            end if\n        end select\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    if (current_length > 0) then\n        print '(a)', buffer(1:current_length)\n    else\n        print '(a)', ''\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but len(input_line) is the declared length (1000), which is wrong. Because input_line is declared as character(1000), len(input_line) is 1000 regardless of the actual content.\n\nAh, right. So after reading via read(*,*) input_line, the input_line is filled with the first token, padded with spaces on the right to reach 1000 characters. But we need to get the actual length of the token. So, use trim(input_line) to remove trailing spaces, but the original input token may contain spaces. Wait, no: the read(*, *) reads the next token, which is a sequence of non-whitespace characters. So input_line after read(*, *) will contain the token left-justified, with trailing spaces. So the actual length of the token is len_trim(input_line).\n\nSo in the code:\n\ninput_line = ''  ! Initialize\nread(*, *) input_line  ! This reads the first token into input_line, left-justified, padded with spaces.\n\nmax_length = len_trim(input_line)  ! The actual length of the token.\n\nThen, loop i from 1 to max_length.\n\nSo adjusting the code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(1000) :: input_line\n    character(:), allocatable :: buffer\n    integer :: i, current_length, max_length\n    character :: c\n\n    ! Read input token\n    read(*, *) input_line\n    max_length = len_trim(input_line)\n\n    ! Allocate buffer with size max_length\n    allocate(character(max_length) :: buffer)\n    current_length = 0\n\n    do i = 1, max_length\n        c = input_line(i:i)\n        select case (c)\n        case ('0', '1')\n            current_length = current_length + 1\n            buffer(current_length:current_length) = c\n        case ('B')\n            if (current_length > 0) then\n                current_length = current_length - 1\n            end if\n        end select\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    if (current_length > 0) then\n        print '(a)', buffer(1:current_length)\n    else\n        print '(a)', ''\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nThis should handle the input correctly. For example, if the input is \"B0 B1\", then the read(*,*) input_line will read \"B0\" (the first token), and process each character.\n\nTesting the sample case where the input is \"01B0\", the code loops through '0','1','B','0'. Processing:\n\ncurrent_length starts at 0.\n\ni=1: '0' \u2192 current_length 1, buffer(1) = '0'\n\ni=2: '1' \u2192 current_length 2, buffer(2) = '1'\n\ni=3: 'B' \u2192 current_length 1\n\ni=4: '0' \u2192 current_length 2, buffer(2) = '0'\n\nSo buffer(1:2) is '0' followed by '0', so output is \"00\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is \"B\". Then max_length is 1. i loops 1 to 1. 'B' is processed: current_length is 0, so no action. Output is empty.\n\nAnother case: input is \"0BB\". The characters are '0','B','B'. \n\ni=1: '0' \u2192 current_length 1.\n\ni=2: 'B' \u2192 current_length 0.\n\ni=3: 'B' \u2192 current_length remains 0.\n\nOutput is empty.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo this should be the correct translation."
