    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's look at the original code first.\n\nThe Java code starts by importing Scanner and then the main class. The main method reads three long integers: pandu, vundu, urdu. Then it calculates the sum of i*pandu for i from 1 to urdu. If the sum c is less than vundu, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints c - vundu.\n\nFirst, let me note the variables. In Java, they're using long, which in Fortran would be integer with kind=8, maybe. But Fortran's default integer size might be sufficient unless the numbers are very big. But since the original uses long, probably better to use integer(kind=8) in Fortran.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read three integers from input.\n2. Compute the cumulative sum c = pandu * (1 + 2 + ... + urdu) = pandu * urdu*(urdu+1)/2. Wait, wait, the original code loops from 1 to urdu and adds i*pandu each time. That's equivalent to pandu multiplied by the sum of 1 to urdu. Sum of 1 to urdu is urdu*(urdu+1)/2. But the original code uses a loop. However, for Fortran, perhaps writing a loop is straightforward.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading inputs is a bit different. Java uses Scanner.nextLong(), but Fortran uses read statements with format specifiers. But since the user inputs are integers, we can read them as such.\n\nVariables in Fortran need to be declared. So variables pandu, vundu, urdu, and c should be declared as integers.\n\nWait, in Java, the variables are of type long. So in Fortran, they should be integer(kind=8) to handle large integers.\n\nSo first, declare variables:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: pandu, vundu, urdu, c, i\n\nThen, read the input. The user enters three numbers, probably in a line. So in Fortran:\n\nread(*,*) pandu, vundu, urdu\n\nThen, compute the sum. The loop in Java is for i from 1 to urdu. So in Fortran, do i = 1, urdu.\n\nInitialize c to 0 before the loop.\n\nc = 0\ndo i = 1, urdu\n    c = c + i * pandu\nend do\n\nAfter the loop, check if c < vundu. If yes, output 0; else, output c - vundu.\n\nIn Fortran, the print statement would be:\n\nif (c < vundu) then\n    print *, '0'\nelse\n    print *, c - vundu\nend if\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram codeforces_546_A\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8) :: pandu, vundu, urdu, c, i\n\n    read(*,*) pandu, vundu, urdu\n    c = 0\n    do i = 1, urdu\n        c = c + i * pandu\n    end do\n    if (c < vundu) then\n        print *, '0'\n    else\n        print *, c - vundu\n    end if\nend program codeforces_546_A\n\nWait, but in Java, the variables are read as long. So in Fortran, using integer(kind=8) is correct. However, the input format must match. When the user inputs the numbers, they should be within the range of 64-bit integers, but that's the same as the Java code.\n\nTesting this code. Let's see. For example, if input is 3 17 4. Then the sum is 3*(1+2+3+4) = 3*10=30. 30-17=13. So output is 13. Which matches the Java code.\n\nAnother test case: if pandu=10, vundu=100, urdu=1. Then sum is 10*1=10. 10 < 100, so output 0.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the variables are declared as integer(kind=8), but when reading with read(*,*), does it handle large integers correctly? The list-directed read should work as long as the input is correctly formatted.\n\nAnother point: In Fortran, the variable names can be longer than 6 characters, so pandu, vundu, urdu are acceptable.\n\nI think that's all. So the translated code should be as above."
