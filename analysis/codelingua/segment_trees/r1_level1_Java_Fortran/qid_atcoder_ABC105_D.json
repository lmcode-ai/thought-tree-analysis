So the key becomes base_prev mod m. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So (base_prev - (a[i] mod m) + a[i] ) mod m = (base_prev + a[i] - a[i] mod m) mod m. But a[i] - (a[i] mod m) is equal to m * (a[i] / m), so adding that to base_prev would make it (base_prev + m * k) mod m = base_prev mod m. So the key is base_prev mod m. \n\nBut base_prev is already a mod m value, since it's computed as (base_prev_prev - a[i-1] mod m + m) mod m, recursively. So base_prev is always in 0 to m-1. So the key becomes (base_prev) mod m, which is just base_prev. Wait, this seems confusing. Let me take an example. Suppose a[i] = 5, m=3. Then a[i] mod m is 2. So base_prev is (base_prev_prev - 2 + 3) mod 3. Then adding a[i] (5) gives (base_prev_prev - 2 +3) mod3 +5. Then mod3 again. But 5 mod3 is 2. So (base_prev_prev -2 +3) mod3 is (base_prev_prev +1) mod3.",

So in Fortran, to compute a_mod as Java's a[i]%m, we can compute:\n\na_mod = a(i) - m * (a(i)/m) But wait, when a(i) is positive, this gives the same as mod. Let's see:\n\na(i) =5, m=3: 5/3=1, 5-3*1=2. Which is correct. Yes. So in Fortran, a_mod should be computed as a(i) - m*(a(i)/m). So in the code:\n\na_mod = a(i) - m * (a(i)/m) But in Fortran, integer division is performed with /, and for negative numbers, it truncates towards zero, just like Java. So the line a_mod = a(i) - m * (a(i)/m) will give the same result as Java's a[i]%m.",

Testing this code with the example where a[0] is 5 and m=3:\n\nIn Java, a_mod = 5%3=2. base is (0 - 2 +3) mod3=1. key is (1+5) mod3=6 mod3=0. So dp[0] becomes 1. ans += dp[1], which is 0. So ans remains 0. But according to our code:\n\na_div =5/3=1.\n\na_mod=5 -3*1=2.\n\nbase = modulo(0 - 2,3) = modulo(-2,3) =1.\n\nkey = mod(1 +2,3) =3 mod3=0. So dp(0)=1. ans += dp(1) which is 0. Correct. Another example where a[0] is -5, m=3:\n\nJava: a_mod is -5%3 =-2. base = (0 - (-2) +3) mod3=5 mod3=2. key= (2 + (-5)) mod3= (-3) mod3=0. So dp[0] is 1. ans += dp[2], which is 0. In Fortran:\n\na_div =-5/3= -1.\n\na_mod =-5 -3*(-1) =-5+3=-2.\n\nbase = modulo(0 - (-2),3) = modulo(2,3)=2. key = mod(2 + (-2),3) =0 mod3=0. dp(0)=1. ans += dp(2) which is 0. Correct. So this code seems to handle negative numbers properly. Now, testing with the example where a[0] is 3, m=3: Java: a_mod=0. base= (0-0 +3) mod3=0. key=(0+3) mod3=0. dp[0] becomes 1. ans += dp[0] which is 1. So ans=1. Fortran:\n\na_div=3/3=1. a_mod=3-3*1=0. base=modulo(0-0,3)=0. key=mod(0+0,3)=0. dp(0)=1. ans += dp(0) =1. Correct. So the code should work.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main logic is in the solve method. They read n and m, then an array a of size n. They use a hashmap called dp to keep track of counts. The variables ans and base are used to calculate the result. \n\nLet me break down the loop. For each element in a, they update base as (base - a[i] % m + m) % m. Then they merge (or update) the hashmap by adding 1 to the key (base + a[i])%m. Then ans is increased by the value in the hashmap for the key base, or 0 if it's not present. \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The base is being subtracted by a[i] mod m, but then adding m and mod m again to keep it positive. Then, the key for the hashmap is (base + a[i]) mod m. And ans adds the count from the hashmap for the current base. \n\nHmm. So this is likely a problem where they are counting subarrays whose sum mod m equals zero. The approach uses cumulative sums and a hashmap to track the frequency of certain remainders. \n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Fortran doesn't have a built-in hashmap, so I need to simulate that. But since m is a modulus, the possible keys are from 0 to m-1. So instead of a dynamic hashmap, we can use an array of size m to track the counts. That's a common optimization in such modulus-based problems. \n\nSo in the Java code, they have a HashMap<Integer, Integer> dp. In Fortran, I'll replace this with an integer array of size 0 to m-1. But wait, m could be up to a large value? Well, in the problem constraints, maybe m is manageable. But if m is up to 1e9, this approach won't work. However, the original Java code uses a hashmap, which suggests that m could be large. But looking at the code again, the key is (base + a[i])%m. Hmm. Wait, maybe the possible keys are within 0 to m-1, so even if m is large, using a hashmap is necessary. But Fortran doesn't have hashmap. So perhaps we need to use a different approach. \n\nWait, but maybe in the problem's context, m isn't too large. Or maybe the original code is using a hashmap for dynamic programming. However, considering that the modulus is m, the possible remainders are from 0 to m-1. So maybe we can use an array of size m. Let's proceed under that assumption, but first check if that's valid.\n\nWait, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. Since base is being updated each iteration, and a[i] is part of the input, how can we know the possible values? Well, each (base + a[i]) mod m could be in 0 to m-1, so the array approach would work. So the maximum possible key is m-1. So the array can be of size 0:m-1. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we can replace the hashmap with an array of size 0:m-1, initialized to zero. Then, the merge operation is equivalent to incrementing the count at that key. \n\nSo for the line dp.merge((base + a[i] % m + m) % m, 1, Integer::sum), which adds 1 to the key (base + a[i])%m. So in Fortran, we can do something like key = mod(base + a(i), m), and then dp(key) = dp(key) + 1. \n\nWait, but base is already computed as (base - a[i] mod m + m) mod m. Let me check:\n\nIn Java code:\n\nbase = (base - a[i] % m + m) % m;\n\nThen, the key is (base + a[i]) % m. Let's compute that:\n\nbase is (base_prev - (a[i] mod m) + m) mod m. \n\nAdding a[i] to that: \n\n(base_prev - (a[i] mod m) + m) mod m + a[i]\n\nThen mod m again. Let's simplify:\n\nLet me compute (base_prev - (a[i] mod m) + m) mod m. Since adding m and mod m, that is equivalent to (base_prev - (a[i] mod m)) mod m. \n\nSo the key is (base_prev - (a[i] mod m) + a[i]) mod m. \n\nBut base_prev is a value mod m. Let me see: \n\nSuppose base_prev is some value. Then:\n\n(base_prev - (a[i] mod m) + a[i]) mod m \n\n= (base_prev + (a[i] - a[i] mod m)) mod m \n\nBut a[i] - a[i] mod m is equal to m * k for some integer k, so when mod m, this term is 0. So the key becomes base_prev mod m. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So (base_prev - (a[i] mod m) + a[i]) mod m = (base_prev + a[i] - a[i] mod m) mod m. But a[i] - (a[i] mod m) is equal to m * (a[i] / m), so adding that to base_prev would make it (base_prev + m * k) mod m = base_prev mod m. \n\nSo the key is base_prev mod m. \n\nBut base_prev is already a mod m value, since it's computed as (base_prev_prev - a[i-1] mod m + m) mod m, recursively. So base_prev is always in 0 to m-1. \n\nSo the key becomes (base_prev) mod m, which is just base_prev. \n\nWait, this seems confusing. Let me take an example. Suppose a[i] = 5, m=3. Then a[i] mod m is 2. So base_prev is (base_prev_prev - 2 + 3) mod 3. Then adding a[i] (5) gives (base_prev_prev - 2 +3) mod3 +5. Then mod3 again. \n\nBut 5 mod3 is 2. So (base_prev_prev -2 +3) mod3 is (base_prev_prev +1) mod3. Let's say base_prev_prev is 0. Then base_prev becomes (0 -2 +3) mod3 = 1 mod3. Then key is (1 +5) mod3 = 6 mod3=0. \n\nBut according to the earlier step, (base_prev - a[i]%m + a[i]) mod m would be (1 -2 +5) mod3 =4 mod3=1. So the key is 1 mod3? Hmm, but that contradicts. So perhaps my earlier analysis was wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me re-calculate. \n\nThe key is (base + a[i]) mod m. \n\nBut base is computed as (base_prev - (a[i] mod m) + m) mod m. \n\nWait, that's for the current iteration's base. Wait, in the code:\n\nThe loop is:\n\nfor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   base = (base - a[i] % m + m) % m;\n\n   key = (base + a[i]) % m\n\n   dp.merge(key, 1, Integer::sum)\n\n   ans += dp.getOrDefault(base, 0)\n\nSo in each iteration, base is updated to (base_prev - a[i]%m +m) mod m. Then the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. \n\nBut the key here is (base_prev - a[i]%m +m) mod m + a[i] mod m. \n\nBecause (base + a[i]) mod m = [ (base_prev - a[i]%m + m) mod m + a[i] ] mod m. \n\nBut (base_prev - a[i]%m +m) mod m is equal to (base_prev - a[i]%m) mod m, since adding m and mod m again. \n\nSo base_new = (base_prev - a[i]%m) mod m. \n\nThen key is (base_new + a[i]) mod m. \n\nWhich is ( (base_prev - a[i]%m) mod m + a[i] ) mod m. \n\nBut a[i] can be written as a[i] = k * m + (a[i]%m). So:\n\n(base_prev - a[i]%m) mod m + a[i] mod m + k * m. \n\nWait, but when you add a[i] to (base_prev - a[i]%m) mod m, the a[i] is added, so a[i] mod m is part of that. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's easier to proceed with the code translation, keeping the same logic as the original Java code. \n\nIn Fortran, I'll need to read the input, then loop through each element. The main challenge is replacing the hashmap with an array. \n\nSo steps to take:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the array a of size n.\n\n3. Initialize an array dp of size 0 to m-1, initialized to 0.\n\n4. Initialize ans as 0, base as 0.\n\n5. Loop over each element in a:\n\n   a. Compute base as (base - mod(a(i), m) + m) mod m. Wait, in Java, the code is (base - a[i] % m + m) % m. So in Fortran, the same calculation: base = mod( base - mod(a(i), m) + m, m )\n\n   b. Compute key = mod( base + a(i), m )\n\n   c. dp(key) += 1\n\n   d. ans += dp( base )\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, they merge the key (base + a[i])%m by adding 1. So in Fortran, we can increment dp(key) by 1 each time. Then, ans is increased by the value of dp.getOrDefault(base, 0), which is dp(base) in the array. But since base is computed as (base_prev - a[i]%m + m) mod m, which is between 0 and m-1, the index is valid. \n\nSo each iteration:\n\n- Update base.\n\n- Increment the count in dp for the key (base + a(i)) mod m.\n\n- Add to ans the current count of dp[base].\n\nBut wait, after updating base, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. Then, the next line adds to ans the value of dp.getOrDefault(base, 0). \n\nWait, that's the key part. So the order is:\n\nFor each i:\n\n   base is updated.\n\n   Then, compute key = (base + a[i]) mod m, and add 1 to dp[key].\n\n   Then, ans is increased by dp[base], which is the value stored at the current base.\n\nWait, but why does this work? Because when you process a[i], you are adding a new entry to the dp for the current key, and then checking how many times the current base has been seen before. \n\nBut the base is computed before updating the dp. So for each i, the steps are:\n\n1. compute new base.\n\n2. compute the key for this i as (base + a[i]) mod m.\n\n3. add 1 to dp[key].\n\n4. add dp[base] to ans.\n\nSo for example, when the loop starts, dp is empty. Let's see:\n\nFirst iteration (i=0):\n\nbase is (0 - a[0]%m + m) mod m.\n\nThen key is (base + a[0]) mod m.\n\nThen dp[key] becomes 1.\n\nThen ans += dp[base], which is dp[base] which was 0 before, unless base is the same as key. Wait, no. Because key is (base + a[0]) mod m, and base is (0 - a[0]%m + m) mod m.\n\nWait, base is (0 - (a[0] mod m) + m) mod m. Let me compute that:\n\n(0 - (a0 mod m) + m) mod m = (m - (a0 mod m)) mod m = ( - (a0 mod m) ) mod m = (m - (a0 mod m)) if a0 mod m != 0, else 0. \n\nThen, key = (base + a0) mod m.\n\nBut base is (m - (a0 mod m)) mod m. So base + a0 is (m - (a0 mod m)) + a0 mod m. Wait, no. Wait a0 can be written as k * m + r, where r is a0 mod m. So:\n\nbase = (m - r) mod m = (m - r) since r < m.\n\nbase + a0 = (m - r) + (k * m + r) = m - r + k*m + r = m + k*m. \n\nmod m: (m + k*m) mod m = 0. So key is 0.\n\nSo for the first element, key is 0. dp[0] is incremented to 1.\n\nThen, ans += dp[base]. Here, base is (m - r). mod m. Which is (m - r) if r != 0, else 0. So base is (m - r) mod m, which is the same as (-r) mod m. \n\nBut dp[base] is the count of times base has been seen. Since we just incremented dp[key], which is 0, but that's not the same as base. Wait, in the first iteration, after base is computed, the key is 0. So we increment dp[0] to 1. Then ans += dp[base]. So dp[base] would be the value of dp at (m - r) mod m. But since we haven't added anything there yet. \n\nWait, in the first iteration, after processing i=0:\n\nbase is (m - a[0] mod m) mod m.\n\nThen key is (base + a[0]) mod m = 0 mod m. So we set dp[0] to 1.\n\nThen ans += dp[base]. So if base is not 0, then dp[base] is 0. So ans remains 0. But if base is 0, then dp[0] is 1, so ans becomes 1. \n\nBut when would base be 0 in the first iteration? If a[0] mod m is 0. Then base = (0 - 0 + m) mod m = m mod m = 0. Then key = (0 + a[0]) mod m = a[0] mod m = 0. So dp[0] becomes 1. Then ans += dp[0], which is 1. \n\nSo in that case, ans is 1. \n\nBut why? Because the subarray from 0 to 0 would have sum a[0], which mod m is 0. So it's a valid count. \n\nSo the logic seems to work. \n\nNow, back to the Fortran code. So in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nInitialize the dp array (size 0 to m-1) to zero. \n\nLoop over each element in a:\n\n   compute base as (base - mod(a(i), m) + m) mod m.\n\n   compute key as mod( base + a(i), m )\n\n   increment dp(key) by 1.\n\n   ans = ans + dp(base)\n\nBut wait, since base is computed as (base_prev - mod(a(i), m) + m) mod m, which is (base_prev - a_mod_m + m) mod m, which ensures it's non-negative. \n\nBut in Fortran, when you do mod, negative numbers can have negative remainders. So we need to make sure that (base_prev - a_mod_m) is adjusted to be positive before mod. \n\nWait, in Java, (x % m) returns a value in the range (-m, m), but in Java, the % operator returns a value with the sign of the dividend. So (base - a_mod_m) could be negative, but adding m and then mod m ensures it's positive. \n\nIn Fortran, the modulo function mod(a, p) returns a result with the same sign as p. So to replicate the Java code's behavior, when computing (base_prev - a_mod_m + m) mod m, we can compute mod(base_prev - a_mod_m, m), but since base_prev and a_mod_m are both in 0..m-1, their difference could be negative. For example, base_prev=0, a_mod_m=3, m=5: 0-3 = -3, mod(-3,5) is 2. Which is the same as adding m and then mod m: (-3 +5) mod5 is 2 mod5=2. So mod(base_prev - a_mod_m, m) gives the same result as (base_prev - a_mod_m + m) mod m. So in Fortran, perhaps we can compute base as modulo( base_prev - a_mod_m, m ). \n\nBecause modulo in Fortran returns a non-negative result when the modulus is positive. Wait, the Fortran MODULO function returns a result with the same sign as the modulus. So for example, modulo(-3,5) is 2. Which is correct. So yes, modulo(base_prev - a_mod_m, m) would give the same result as in Java. \n\nSo the code for base would be:\n\nbase = modulo( base - mod(a(i), m), m )\n\nThen, key is modulo( base + a(i), m )\n\nBut since a(i) could be large, adding base (which is up to m-1) and a(i) could be a large number. But modulo takes care of that. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: base = 0\n\ninteger :: ans = 0\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: dp\n\nallocate(dp(0:m-1))\n\ndp = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    a_mod = mod(a(i), m)\n\n    base = modulo( base - a_mod, m )\n\n    key = mod( base + a(i), m )\n\n    dp(key) = dp(key) + 1\n\n    ans = ans + dp(base)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default. Wait, no, the dp array is dimensioned as (0:m-1), so we can access dp(0), dp(1), ..., dp(m-1). \n\nYes. So when allocating dp(0:m-1), the indices are 0-based. \n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead n, m\n\nRead array a(1..n)\n\nAllocate dp(0:m-1), initialize to 0.\n\nInitialize base = 0, ans =0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to n:\n\n   a_mod = mod(a(i), m)\n\n   base = modulo( base - a_mod, m )\n\n   key = mod( base + a(i), m )\n\n   dp(key) = dp(key) +1\n\n   ans = ans + dp(base)\n\nend loop\n\nprint ans.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the initial dp is empty. But in Fortran, the dp array is initialized to zero. So in the first iteration, when we increment dp(key), it starts from 0. \n\nSo this should work. \n\nNow, handling the input. The Java code uses a custom InputReader class. In Fortran, we can read from standard input using read statements. But need to be careful with reading multiple integers from a line. \n\nIn the Java code, the input is read via nextInt() and nextIntArray(n). The Fortran code can read the entire line and parse the integers. \n\nBut handling input in Fortran can be tricky. For example, if the input is given as a single line with n and m, then two lines: one with n integers. \n\nBut in the Java code, the input is read via nextInt() for n and m, then nextIntArray(n) for the array. So in Fortran, we can read n and m from the first line, then the array from the next line. \n\nBut perhaps the input is structured as:\n\nn m\n\na1 a2 ... an\n\nSo the first line has n and m, and the second line has the array. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nread(*,*) n, m\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread(*,*) a\n\nBut in some cases, the array may be split across multiple lines. But for simplicity, assuming that the input is as two lines. \n\nBut in practice, the input could be split into multiple tokens, which are read as needed. \n\nThe original Java code's InputReader class reads tokens as needed. So perhaps in Fortran, using list-directed input (read with *) would work, as it skips over whitespace and newlines. \n\nSo the Fortran code can start as:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, i, a_mod, key, base, ans\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), dp(:)\n\nread(*,*) n, m\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread(*,*) a\n\nallocate(dp(0:m-1))\n\ndp = 0\n\nbase = 0\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    a_mod = mod(a(i), m)\n\n    base = modulo( base - a_mod, m )\n\n    key = mod( base + a(i), m )\n\n    dp(key) = dp(key) + 1\n\n    ans = ans + dp(base)\n\nend do\n\nprint '(i0)', ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but wait: in the Java code, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m. But in Fortran, a(i) can be a large number, but mod(base + a(i), m) will correctly compute the remainder. \n\nBut what if a(i) is negative? The Java code uses a[i] % m, which returns a negative remainder if a[i] is negative. For example, (-5) % 3 in Java is -2. But in Fortran, mod(-5,3) is 1. So this could be a problem. \n\nWait, the original Java code uses a[i] % m. So if a[i] is negative, the mod is negative. But in the Java code, the base is computed as (base - a[i]%m + m) % m. So when a[i] is negative, a[i]%m is negative, so base is adjusted accordingly. \n\nBut in Fortran, mod(a(i), m) returns a non-negative result. So the handling of negative a[i] would differ. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, are the a[i] allowed to be negative? The original Java code seems to handle it. So if the Fortran code uses mod, which returns a positive remainder, then the base calculation would differ. \n\nThis is a problem. For example, suppose a[i] is -5, m=3. Java's a[i]%m is -5%3 = -2. Then base is computed as (base - (-2) +3 ) mod3. But in Fortran, mod(-5,3) is 1. So base would be (base -1 +3) mod3. \n\nSo in this case, the code would behave differently. \n\nThis is a critical point. The Java code uses a[i]%m, which can be negative, but the Fortran code uses mod(a(i), m), which is non-negative. To replicate the Java code's behavior, we need to compute a_mod as a(i) mod m but with Java's sign. \n\nBut how? Because in Java, a % m has the same sign as a. \n\nSo in Fortran, for a negative a(i), mod(a(i), m) gives a positive remainder. But in Java, it's negative. So to get the same a_mod as in Java, we need to adjust. \n\nFor example, in Java:\n\n-5 mod 3 = -2.\n\nIn Fortran, mod(-5,3) = 1. \n\nSo to get the Java's a_mod, we can compute:\n\na_mod = mod(a(i), m)\n\nif (a_mod < 0) then\n\n   a_mod = a_mod + m\n\nend if\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because in Java, the result of a % m is in the range [-m+1, m-1]. So for negative a, the mod is negative. \n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to compute a_mod as a(i) - m * floor( real(a(i)) / real(m) ), but that's complicated. \n\nAlternatively, use the modulo function in Fortran. Because in Fortran, the modulo function returns a result with the same sign as the modulus. So modulo(-5, 3) is 1. \n\nBut in Java, the remainder is -2. \n\nSo to compute a[i] % m as Java does, we need to compute it as a_mod = a(i) - m * (a(i) / m), but considering integer division in Java truncates towards zero. \n\nFor example:\n\nJava: (-5) / 3 is -1. So -5 -3*(-1) = -5 +3 = -2. \n\nFortran: division of integers truncates towards zero. So (-5)/3 is -1. \n\nSo in Fortran, a_mod = a(i) - m * (a(i)/m)\n\nBut for positive numbers, mod(a(i), m) would be the same. \n\nSo for a(i) negative, a_mod = a(i) - m * (a(i)/m) gives the same as Java's a[i]%m. \n\nSo for example:\n\na(i) = -5, m=3:\n\na(i)/m = -5/3 = -1 (since Fortran truncates towards zero)\n\nso a_mod = -5 -3*(-1) = -5 +3 = -2. \n\nWhich matches Java. \n\nSo in Fortran, to compute a_mod as Java's a[i]%m, we can compute:\n\na_mod = a(i) - m * (a(i)/m)\n\nBut wait, when a(i) is positive, this gives the same as mod. Let's see:\n\na(i) =5, m=3: 5/3=1, 5-3*1=2. Which is correct. \n\nYes. So in Fortran, a_mod should be computed as a(i) - m*(a(i)/m). \n\nSo in the code:\n\na_mod = a(i) - m * (a(i)/m)\n\nBut in Fortran, integer division is performed with /, and for negative numbers, it truncates towards zero, just like Java. \n\nSo the line a_mod = a(i) - m * (a(i)/m) will give the same result as Java's a[i]%m. \n\nThus, the code needs to compute a_mod this way. \n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nIn the loop:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    a_div = a(i) / m\n\n    a_mod = a(i) - m * a_div\n\n    base = modulo( base - a_mod, m )\n\n    key = mod( base + a(i), m )\n\n    dp(key) = dp(key) +1\n\n    ans = ans + dp(base)\n\nend do\n\nBut wait, in the code for key, we have base + a(i), then mod m. But a(i) can be large. However, mod(base + a(i), m) is the same as mod( (base mod m) + (a(i) mod m), m ). But since base is already modulo m, because it's computed as modulo(...). So base is in [0, m-1]. \n\nBut a(i) can be any integer. So adding base (0..m-1) and a(i), then mod m. \n\nBut when we compute key, perhaps we should compute (base + a_mod) mod m. Because a(i) mod m is a_mod (from Java's computation). \n\nBecause a(i) mod m (Java) is a_mod. So base + a(i) mod m (Java) is base + a_mod. \n\nWait, but in the Java code, key is (base + a[i]) mod m. Which is equivalent to (base + a_mod_java) mod m, where a_mod_java is a[i]%m (Java's mod). \n\nBut in Fortran, a_mod is a_mod_java, computed as a(i) - m * (a(i)/m). \n\nSo key in Fortran should be (base + a_mod_java) mod m. \n\nBut in the original Java code, the key is (base + a[i]) mod m, which is (base + a[i]) mod m. But a[i] can be any integer. So (base + a[i]) mod m is equivalent to (base + a_mod_java) mod m. Because a[i] mod m is a_mod_java. \n\nSo in Fortran, key can be computed as mod( base + a_mod_java, m ). \n\nSo in the code, after computing a_mod_java (which is a_mod in the code), compute key as mod( base + a_mod_java, m ). \n\nBut then, why is the original Java code using (base + a[i]) mod m instead of (base + a_mod_java) mod m? Because (base + a[i]) mod m is equivalent to (base + a_mod_java) mod m. \n\nSo in Fortran, we can compute key as mod( base + a_mod, m ), where a_mod is Java's a[i]%m. \n\nSo the code for key should be mod( base + a_mod, m ). \n\nSo the loop becomes:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    a_div = a(i) / m\n\n    a_mod = a(i) - m * a_div\n\n    base = modulo( base - a_mod, m )\n\n    key = mod( base + a_mod, m )\n\n    dp(key) = dp(key) + 1\n\n    ans = ans + dp(base)\n\nend do\n\nThis would replicate the Java code's calculation of key. \n\nThis is an important correction. \n\nSo this handles the mod correctly for Java's a[i]%m. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran code needs to read n and m, read the array a, compute a_mod as Java's a[i]%m for each element, then proceed. \n\nThus, the full Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, m, i, a_div, a_mod, key, base, ans\n\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), dp(:)\n\n    read(*,*) n, m\n\n    allocate(a(n))\n\n    read(*,*) a\n\n    allocate(dp(0:m-1))\n\n    dp = 0\n\n    base = 0\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        a_div = a(i) / m\n\n        a_mod = a(i) - m * a_div\n\n        base = modulo( base - a_mod, m )\n\n        key = modulo( base + a_mod, m )\n\n        dp(key) = dp(key) + 1\n\n        ans = ans + dp(base)\n\n    end do\n\n    print '(i0)', ans\n\nend program main\n\nBut wait, why are we using modulo for key? Because mod( base + a_mod, m ) can be negative if base + a_mod is negative. For example, base = 0, a_mod = -2, m=3: 0 + (-2) = -2 mod 3. In Java, -2 mod 3 is 1. In Fortran, mod(-2,3) is 1. So using mod is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, using modulo may be redundant, but mod(base + a_mod, m) would handle it correctly. \n\nTesting this code with the example where a[0] is 5 and m=3:\n\nIn Java, a_mod = 5%3=2. base is (0 - 2 +3) mod3=1. key is (1+5) mod3=6 mod3=0. So dp[0] becomes 1. ans += dp[1], which is 0. So ans remains 0.\n\nBut according to our code:\n\na_div =5/3=1.\n\na_mod=5 -3*1=2.\n\nbase = modulo(0 - 2,3) = modulo(-2,3) =1.\n\nkey = mod(1 +2,3) =3 mod3=0. So dp(0)=1. ans += dp(1) which is 0. Correct. \n\nAnother example where a[0] is -5, m=3:\n\nJava: a_mod is -5%3 =-2. base = (0 - (-2) +3) mod3=5 mod3=2. key= (2 + (-5)) mod3= (-3) mod3=0. So dp[0] is 1. ans += dp[2], which is 0. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\na_div =-5/3= -1.\n\na_mod =-5 -3*(-1) =-5+3=-2.\n\nbase = modulo(0 - (-2),3) = modulo(2,3)=2.\n\nkey = mod(2 + (-2),3) =0 mod3=0. dp(0)=1. ans += dp(2) which is 0. Correct. \n\nSo this code seems to handle negative numbers properly. \n\nNow, testing with the example where a[0] is 3, m=3:\n\nJava: a_mod=0. base= (0-0 +3) mod3=0. key=(0+3) mod3=0. dp[0] becomes 1. ans += dp[0] which is 1. So ans=1. \n\nFortran:\n\na_div=3/3=1. a_mod=3-3*1=0. base=modulo(0-0,3)=0. key=mod(0+0,3)=0. dp(0)=1. ans += dp(0) =1. Correct. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nThus, the final Fortran code is as written."
