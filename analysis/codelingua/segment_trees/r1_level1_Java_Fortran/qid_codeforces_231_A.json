But in the original code, the conditions (a and b) are (2 and 1) which are not 1, so the code would not count this case. But the sum approach would count it. So that's a mistake. So I need to replicate the original logic correctly. So in Fortran, the condition should be:\n\n(a == 1 .and. b == 1) .or. (a ==1 .and. c ==1) .or. (b ==1 .and. c ==1)\n\nBecause in Fortran, logical operators are .and., .or., etc. So that's how the condition should be written. So the correct translation would check each pair, just like the Java code. So let's adjust the code. So the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_231_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: t, a, b, c, count, i\n    read(*,*) t\n    count = 0 do i = 1, t\n        read(*,*) a, b, c\n        if ((a == 1 .and. b == 1) .or.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Hmm, Java and Fortran are pretty different. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nSo the Java program reads an integer t from the input, which is the number of test cases. Then for each test case, it reads three integers a, b, c. If at least two of them are 1, it increments the count. Finally, it prints the count.\n\nRight, so the main steps are:\n\n1. Read t.\n2. Initialize count to 0.\n3. Loop t times:\n   a. Read a, b, c.\n   b. Check if the sum of a, b, c is >= 2, since each is 1 or 0 (wait, wait, but in the original code, the variables a, b, c are integers read from input. Wait, but the problem statement might assume they are either 0 or 1. Because in the Java code, they are read as integers, but the condition checks for 1s. For example, if a is 1 and b is 1, then sum is 2, which would meet the condition. Similarly, any two 1s. So maybe the code is checking if the sum of a, b, c is >= 2. Because the original condition checks for any two or all three being 1. Because (a and b) or (a and c) or (b and c) is equivalent to sum >= 2.\n\nWait, let's see: The condition in Java is:\n\nif ((a ==1 && b ==1) || (a==1 && c==1) || (b==1 && c==1) || (all three are 1)).\n\nBut actually, the last condition is redundant because if all three are 1, then any two of them is 1. So the condition simplifies to whether at least two variables are 1. So the sum of a, b, c (each 0 or 1) must be >=2.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps we can compute the sum and check if it's >= 2. That might be simpler.\n\nSo first, in Fortran, how to read input. In Java, they use Scanner. In Fortran, we'll use read statements.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the program structure would be:\n\nprogram name\n    implicit none\n    integer :: t, a, b, c, count, i\n    read(*,*) t\n    count = 0\n    do i = 1, t\n        read(*,*) a, b, c\n        if (a + b + c >= 2) then\n            count = count + 1\n        endif\n    end do\n    print *, count\nend program\n\nWait, but wait. The original code's variables a, b, c are read as integers. So if, for example, a is 2 and b is 1, then their sum would be 3, which would be >=2. But in the original Java code, the condition would check if (2 and 1 are both 1). So in that case, the original code's condition would be false. So my approach of summing a, b, c and checking >=2 is incorrect unless a, b, c are all 0 or 1.\n\nBut the problem statement isn't given here. But looking at the Java code, the variables a, b, c are read as integers. However, in the code's logic, the code is counting how many times at least two of them are 1. So for example, if a=2, b=1, c=1, then the sum is 4, which would pass the sum >=2 check, but in the original code, (a==1) would be false for a=2, so the conditions (like a==1 and b==1) would not be met, and thus count wouldn't be incremented. So the sum approach is wrong.\n\nAh, right. So the original code checks for exactly two or three 1s. The variables a, b, c can be any integers, but only when exactly two or three of them are 1 will count be incremented.\n\nSo my initial approach of summing and checking sum >=2 is incorrect. For example, if a=2, b=1, c=1, sum is 4. But in the original code, the conditions (a and b) are (2 and 1) which are not 1, so the code would not count this case. But the sum approach would count it. So that's a mistake.\n\nSo I need to replicate the original logic correctly. So in Fortran, the condition should be:\n\n(a == 1 .and. b == 1) .or. (a ==1 .and. c ==1) .or. (b ==1 .and. c ==1)\n\nBecause in Fortran, logical operators are .and., .or., etc. So that's how the condition should be written.\n\nSo the correct translation would check each pair, just like the Java code.\n\nSo let's adjust the code.\n\nSo the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_231_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: t, a, b, c, count, i\n    read(*,*) t\n    count = 0\n    do i = 1, t\n        read(*,*) a, b, c\n        if ((a == 1 .and. b == 1) .or. (a == 1 .and. c == 1) .or. (b == 1 .and. c == 1)) then\n            count = count + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n    print *, count\nend program codeforces_231_A\n\nThat's more accurate. Let's check: in each iteration, we read a, b, c. Then check if any two of them are 1. If yes, increment count.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nNow, about the input reading. The Java code uses Scanner, which by default splits the input on whitespace. In Fortran, when you read with read(*,*) a, b, c, it will read three integers from the input, separated by any amount of whitespace. So that's equivalent.\n\nAnother thing: in Java, the loop is while (t-- >0), which decreases t each time. In Fortran, the loop do i=1, t will run t times. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code should work as intended.\n\nI think that's the correct translation."
