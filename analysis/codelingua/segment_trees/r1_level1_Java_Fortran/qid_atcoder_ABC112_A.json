    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nThe main part is the program reads an integer n. If n is 1, it prints \"Hello World\". Otherwise, it reads two integers and prints their sum. The Java code uses a helper function read(len) which reads 'len' lines from input and returns them as an array. There's also a close method for the BufferedReader, but maybe in Fortran we don't need to handle that as much.\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure of a Fortran program. Fortran programs start with a program statement, and variables are declared before any executable statements. So, the main steps would be:\n\n1. Read the integer n.\n2. If n is 1, print \"Hello World\".\n3. Else, read two integers and print their sum.\n\nIn Java, the read function handles input, but in Fortran, we can use read statements directly. Let's think about how to replicate that.\n\nIn Fortran, to read from standard input, we can use read(*,*) which reads from the console. So for reading n, we can do:\n\ninteger :: n\nread(*,*) n\n\nThen, if n == 1, print the message. Otherwise, read two numbers and add them.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the case where after reading n, we read two lines if n is not 1? The original Java code reads len lines using the read function, which for len=2 would read two lines. Each line is a separate input. So in Fortran, when n is not 1, we need to read two integers, each possibly on separate lines.\n\nSo for the else case:\n\ninteger :: a, b\nread(*,*) a\nread(*,*) b\nprint *, a + b\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, a, b\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    if (n == 1) then\n        print *, \"Hello World\"\n    else\n        read(*,*) a\n        read(*,*) b\n        print *, a + b\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but the Java code's read function for len=2 returns the next two lines. Each read in Fortran with read(*,*) would read a line, right? Because by default, each read statement reads a new line unless formatted otherwise. So the code above would work as intended.\n\nTesting this: if n is 1, output is \"Hello World\". Otherwise, read two lines, each containing a number, and output their sum.\n\nI think this should handle the cases correctly. The Java code uses a helper function to read lines, but Fortran's read statements can directly read each line. So the translation should be straightforward.\n\nWhat about the case where input is not properly formatted? Well, the original Java code doesn't handle exceptions, so the Fortran code can ignore error handling too.\n\nSo the Fortran code would look like the above. Let me check the syntax again.\n\nYes, in Fortran, 'implicit none' is used to require explicit variable declaration. The variables n, a, b are declared as integers. The if-else structure uses 'then' and 'end if'. Print statements use 'print *, ...'. Each read statement reads a line, so two reads for a and b when n is not 1.\n\nThat should be the correct translation."
