    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe code reads input from the user. It uses a Scanner and adds each line to an ArrayList until an exception occurs, which probably happens when there's no more input. Then it splits the first line into two integers, Sheep and Wolve. If Wolve is greater than or equal to Sheep, it prints \"unsafe\", else \"safe\".\n\nBut in Fortran, reading input is a bit different. Let's think about how to read the input. In Java, they're reading lines until there's an exception. But in the example, maybe the input is a single line with two numbers. Because the Java code takes scList.get(0), so only the first line is used. So perhaps the rest of the code for multiple lines isn't necessary here. Maybe the Java code is written to handle multiple lines but in practice, the input is just one line.\n\nSo for Fortran, I can just read a single line, split it into two integers. So the Fortran code doesn't need the loop to read multiple lines. Just read the first line.\n\nFortran's way to read input can be done with READ(*,*) to read from standard input. Let's see. So in Fortran, we can declare two integer variables, say, Sheep and Wolve. Then read them in one line.\n\nWait, the original Java code splits the first line into two parts. So the Fortran code should read a line, split into two integers.\n\nIn Fortran, when you use READ(*,*), it automatically splits by whitespace. So if the input line is \"3 5\", reading into two variables would work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read two integers from input, S and W (since variable names in Fortran are case-insensitive, but maybe use lowercase for safety).\n\nThen, compare if W >= S. If yes, print 'unsafe', else 'safe'.\n\nSo code steps:\n\n1. Declare variables: integer :: s, w\n2. Read the input line into s and w.\n3. Compare and print.\n\nLet me check if there's any edge cases. For example, what if the input has more than two numbers? The original code splits the first line and takes the first two. So in Fortran, using READ(*,*) s, w would read the first two values from the input line, ignoring any extras. Which matches the Java code's behavior.\n\nSo the Fortran code would be something like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: sheep, wolve\n    read(*, *) sheep, wolve\n    if (wolve >= sheep) then\n        print *, 'unsafe'\n    else\n        print *, 'safe'\n    end if\nend program main\n\nWait, but variable names in Fortran are case-insensitive. So 'Sheep' and 'sheep' are the same. But in the Java code, variables start with uppercase (Sheep and Wolve). But in Fortran, variables are usually lowercase. So changing to lowercase would be better.\n\nYes, the code above uses 'sheep' and 'wolve' as variables. Wait, wait, in the Java code, it's 'Sheep' and 'Wolve'. So in Fortran, variables can be named as such, but perhaps in lowercase for convention.\n\nSo the code should correctly read the two integers, compare, and output the appropriate message.\n\nI think that's the correct translation. Let me check again the original code. The Java code reads all possible lines, but only uses the first one. So the Fortran code only needs to read the first line, which the READ statement does.\n\nYes. So the Fortran code should work as intended."
