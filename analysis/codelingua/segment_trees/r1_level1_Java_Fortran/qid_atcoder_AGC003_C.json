    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe problem seems to be about finding the minimum number of swaps needed to sort the array in a certain way. Let me look at the code step by step. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer N, then reads N integers. These integers are stored in a PriorityQueue to sort them and a HashMap to remember their original indices. Then, it processes each number in sorted order. For each number, it checks if the original index (mod 2) is different from the current position (bin) mod 2. If so, it increments the diff counter. Finally, the answer is diff divided by 2.\n\nSo the key parts are: sorting the array, tracking original indices, and counting parity mismatches between sorted positions and original indices. Then, dividing by two gives the answer.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about the steps:\n\n1. Read N and the array.\n2. Sort the array, but keep track of the original indices. Because in Java, the HashMap maps the value to its original index, but if there are duplicate values, this would be a problem. But assuming all elements are unique? The original code uses a HashMap, which would overwrite entries if there are duplicate keys. So perhaps the input has all distinct elements. So in Fortran, perhaps we need to create a structure that holds both the value and its original index, then sort them based on the value.\n\nSo maybe create an array of pairs (value, original index), then sort this array by value. Then, iterate through the sorted array, and for each element, check if the original index's parity matches the current position's parity (0-based or 1-based? Let's see: in Java, the code uses bin which starts at 0, increments each time. So the positions are 0, 1, 0, 1, etc., since bin is modulo 2. Wait, bin is incremented each time. So the parity of bin (even or odd) corresponds to the position in the sorted order. For each element in the sorted list, the current bin (0-based) is checked against the original index's parity. If they differ, increment diff.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read N, then read the array A of size N.\n- Create an array of structures or a 2D array where each element is (A(i), i) where i is the original index (0-based or 1-based? The original Java code uses 0-based, as in the loop for (int i = 0; i < N; i++). So original indices are 0-based.\n\nWait, in Java, the original indices are from 0 to N-1. Then, the sorted list is processed in order, with the first element having bin=0, next bin=1, then bin=0 again (since bin is modded by 2 each time). Wait, no: the code increments bin, then does bin %= 2. So bin alternates between 0 and 1 each iteration. Wait, let's see:\n\nInitially, bin is 0. Then, in the loop:\n\nAfter processing the first number, bin becomes (0 +1) % 2 = 1.\n\nSecond number: bin becomes 0.\n\nThird: 1, etc. So the parity of bin (0 for even steps, 1 for odd steps) corresponds to the position in the sorted list (if we start counting from 0). Wait, no. Because for the first element, the bin is 0. Then after incrementing, bin becomes 1. Then in the next iteration, when processing the next element, bin is 1 (but after that, it's incremented again). Wait, let's re-express:\n\nThe loop is:\n\nwhile (!nums.isEmpty()) {\n\n   num = nums.poll();\n\n   idx = map.get(num);\n\n   if ((bin % 2) != (idx % 2)) diff++;\n\n   bin++;\n\n   bin %= 2;\n\n}\n\nWait, the bin is incremented after checking. So for the first element, bin starts at 0. The check is bin (0) %2 vs idx%2. Then bin is increased to 1, then mod 2 becomes 1. Next element: check bin (1) mod 2 vs next idx. Then bin becomes 2, mod 2 is 0. So the bin alternates between 0 and 1 each step. But the position in the sorted array is 0,1,2,... So the bin is 0,1,0,1, etc., but the index in the sorted array is 0,1,2,3, etc. So the parity of the position (0-based) is whether it's even or odd. The bin variable is toggling between 0 and 1 each step. So for the first element in sorted order (position 0), bin is 0. Then after processing, bin becomes 1. For the next element (position 1), bin is 1. After processing, bin becomes 0. For position 2, bin is 0 again. Wait, this seems like bin is tracking the parity of the position. Because for the first element (pos 0), bin is 0. For the second (pos 1), bin is 1. For the third (pos 2), bin is 0 again. Wait, no. Because bin starts at 0. After first iteration, bin becomes 0+1=1 mod 2. So for the first element, bin is 0. Then, after processing, bin becomes 1. Then, for the next element (second in the sorted list), during the check, bin is 1. Then, after incrementing, bin becomes 2 mod 2 = 0. So the parity of the bin during each check is 0,1,0,1, etc. Which corresponds to even, odd, even, odd, etc. So the bin variable is actually tracking the parity of the number of elements processed so far. Because the first element is count 1 (after processing), so bin is 1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bin variable's parity during the check is the same as the parity of the current element's position in the sorted array. Let's see:\n\nFor each element in the sorted array, the code processes them in order. The first element is processed with bin=0. Then, after processing, bin is 1. The second element is processed with bin=1, then bin becomes 0. The third element is processed with bin=0, then becomes 1, etc. So during the check for each element, the bin value is the same as (element's 0-based position) mod 2. Because the first element (position 0) has bin 0. Second (position 1) has bin 1. Third (position 2) has bin 0 (since after processing two elements, bin is 0 again). Wait, no. Let's track:\n\nInitial bin is 0.\n\nProcess first element (position 0):\n\ncheck bin%2 (0) vs idx%2.\n\nThen bin becomes 0+1=1 mod 2 \u2192 1.\n\nProcess second element (position 1):\n\ncheck bin 1 mod 2 (1) vs idx%2.\n\nThen bin becomes 1+1=2 mod 2 \u2192 0.\n\nProcess third element (position 2):\n\ncheck bin 0 mod 2 (0) vs idx%2.\n\nThen bin becomes 0+1=1 mod 2 \u2192 1.\n\nSo for the position in the sorted array (0-based), the bin during the check is 0,1,0,1, etc., which is exactly the parity of the position (0%2=0, 1%2=1, 2%2=0, etc). So bin during the check is equal to the position mod 2. Therefore, the code is comparing the original index's parity (idx%2) with the position's parity (pos%2) in the sorted array. If they differ, increment diff.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of elements where the parity of their original index differs from the parity of their position in the sorted array. Then, the answer is diff // 2. Because each swap can fix two mismatches.\n\nSo now, how to translate this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, we can create an array of structures to hold the value and original index. Then sort this array by value. Then, for each element in the sorted array, check if (original index mod 2) is equal to (position in sorted array mod 2). If not, increment diff.\n\nBut wait, the original code's bin is equivalent to the position mod 2. So, the position in the sorted array is 0-based. So for each element in the sorted array, the position is i (0-based), and bin is i%2.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Read N and array A.\n\n2. Create an array of (A(i), i) for i=0 to N-1 (assuming 0-based index, but Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. So need to adjust here.)\n\nWait, in Java, the original indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps the original indices are 1-based. So when we read the array, the first element is index 1, second index 2, etc. So when we sort, we track their original indices (1-based). Then, when comparing their original index mod 2 with their position in the sorted array (0-based or 1-based?).\n\nWait, this is a crucial point. Let's see:\n\nIn Java, the original indices are 0-based. The code checks (original index) mod 2 versus (position in sorted array) mod 2, where the position is 0-based (since bin starts at 0 and increments each step). So for each element in the sorted array, the position is 0-based.\n\nIn Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the original indices are 1-based. So for each element in the sorted array, which is sorted in ascending order, their positions are 1, 2, ..., N. So the position is 1-based. Therefore, when comparing (original index mod 2) and (position mod 2), we need to adjust for 1-based indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in Fortran, when creating the array of (value, original index), the original index is 0-based (like Java). But Fortran's arrays are 1-based. So perhaps when reading the input, we can treat the original index as 0-based. For example, in the loop:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    read *, tmp\n    call add to array (tmp, i-1)  ! 0-based index\nend do\n\nThen, when we sort the array by value, for each element in the sorted array, the position in the array is 0-based (0,1,..., N-1). So (position mod 2) is the same as (i-1) mod 2, where i is the 1-based index in the sorted array. Because for the first element (i=1), position is 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can create a derived type to hold the value and original index (0-based). Then sort the array of this derived type. Then loop over each element in the sorted array (i from 1 to N), and calculate (i-1) mod 2 (to get 0-based position parity) and compare with original index mod 2.\n\nYes. So steps:\n\n- Read N.\n\n- Read N numbers into an array.\n\n- Create an array of structs with each element containing the value and its original index (0-based).\n\n- Sort this array in ascending order of value.\n\n- For each element in the sorted array (from 1 to N, 1-based), compute the 0-based position (i-1). Then, compute (i-1) mod 2 and compare with original index mod 2. If they are different, increment diff.\n\n- The answer is diff // 2.\n\nSo how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have a built-in priority queue, but we can sort an array.\n\nWe can create a derived type:\n\ntype element\n    integer :: value\n    integer :: original_index\nend type element\n\nThen create an array of this type, fill it with the input values and their original indices (0-based). Then sort this array based on the value.\n\nBut how to sort an array of derived types in Fortran? One approach is to use the built-in sort functions, but they require some handling. Alternatively, we can implement a custom sorting routine, like quicksort.\n\nBut for simplicity, perhaps we can use the intrinsic sort function, but in Fortran, it's a bit more involved. Wait, Fortran 2003 introduced the intrinsic module iso_fortran_env, but for sorting, perhaps we need to write a custom sort.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to sort the elements based on their value, and handle their original indices, perhaps we can create a list of pairs and sort them.\n\nAnother approach: create two arrays, one for the values and one for the original indices, and sort the values array while keeping track of the original indices.\n\nBut that's more complicated. Alternatively, using a derived type array and sorting it.\n\nIn Fortran, sorting a derived type array can be done using a custom subroutine. Let's proceed.\n\nSo:\n\n- Read N.\n\n- Allocate an array of type(element) of size N.\n\n- Read each element and store the value and original index (0-based).\n\n- Sort the array by value in ascending order.\n\nOnce sorted, loop through each element, and for each, compute the position in the sorted array (0-based) as (i-1), then check if (position mod 2) != (original index mod 2). If so, increment diff.\n\nFinally, divide diff by 2 to get the answer.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    type element\n        integer :: val\n        integer :: idx\n    end type element\n\n    integer :: N, i, tmp, diff, pos\n    type(element), allocatable :: arr(:)\n    integer, parameter :: stdin = 5\n\n    read *, N\n    allocate(arr(N))\n    do i = 1, N\n        read *, tmp\n        arr(i)%val = tmp\n        arr(i)%idx = i-1  ! 0-based index\n    end do\n\n    ! Sort arr by val\n    call sort_elements(arr)\n\n    diff = 0\n    do i = 1, N\n        pos = i - 1  ! 0-based position in sorted array\n        if (mod(arr(i)%idx, 2) /= mod(pos, 2)) then\n            diff = diff + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, diff / 2\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine sort_elements(a)\n        type(element), intent(inout) :: a(:)\n        ! Implement a simple bubble sort or quicksort. Since N can be up to 1e5, but the original code uses a PriorityQueue which is O(N log N), but for the sake of correctness, perhaps in Fortran we need a more efficient sort. However, given time constraints, perhaps use a built-in function.\n\n        ! But Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort for derived types. So need to implement it.\n\n        ! Let's use a simple bubble sort for small N, but for large N, this would be too slow. But given that the original Java code uses a PriorityQueue (O(N log N)), perhaps we need an O(N log N) sort. But in practice, implementing a quicksort.\n\n        ! Alternatively, using the Fortran 2008 intrinsic procedure, but it's not available in all compilers.\n\n        ! Let's use a quicksort implementation for the derived type array.\n\n        integer :: i, j, n\n        type(element) :: temp\n        logical :: swapped\n\n        n = size(a)\n        do i = 1, n-1\n            swapped = .false.\n            do j = 1, n-i\n                if (a(j)%val > a(j+1)%val) then\n                    temp = a(j)\n                    a(j) = a(j+1)\n                    a(j+1) = temp\n                    swapped = .true.\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (.not. swapped) exit\n        end do\n    end subroutine sort_elements\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but this is a bubble sort, which is O(N^2) time. For N up to 1e5, this would be way too slow. The original code can handle N up to 1e5, as NUM is defined as 1e5+2. So we need an efficient sorting algorithm.\n\nBut implementing a quicksort in Fortran for derived types is a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the built-in sort function for integers and manage the indices. But that requires sorting the values and keeping track of the original indices.\n\nAnother approach: create two arrays, values and indices, sort them together. So, for example:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: values(:), indices(:)\n...\ndo i=1, N\n    values(i) = ... \n    indices(i) = i-1\nend do\n\ncall sort_values_and_indices(values, indices)\n\nBut how to sort the values and indices arrays such that values is sorted and indices correspond to the original positions.\n\nAlternatively, create an array of indices that sort the values, then reorder both arrays. But this also requires some steps.\n\nBut this can be done using the same approach as the Java code's priority queue.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way in Fortran is to use the intrinsic function to sort the array and track the indices.\n\nWait, in Fortran, there's no built-in function to get the sorting indices. So perhaps the most efficient way is to create an array of indices, then sort them based on the values.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: indices(:), temp_indices(:)\n...\nallocate(indices(N))\ndo i=1, N\n    indices(i) = i\nend do\n\ncall quicksort(indices, values)\n\nBut then, values are stored in another array. So for each index in the indices array, values(indices(i)) gives the sorted values.\n\nBut this requires a custom sorting subroutine that sorts the indices based on the values.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\n- Have an array of values and original indices (0-based).\n\n- Create an array of indices (1..N) that will be sorted based on the corresponding values.\n\n- Then, using a custom sorting routine (like quicksort) that sorts the indices array by comparing the values.\n\nOnce sorted, the indices array will contain the positions in the original array that would sort the values. Then, the original indices can be obtained from the original array's indices.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think again.\n\nOriginal Java code uses a PriorityQueue to sort the values. Then, for each value in the sorted order, it looks up the original index from the HashMap.\n\nBut in Java, if there are duplicate values, the HashMap would overwrite previous entries, leading to incorrect results. But perhaps the problem statement ensures that all values are distinct. Otherwise, the code would fail. So we can assume all input values are unique.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we can sort the array of (value, original index) pairs based on the value. Once sorted, we can process each element in order, and compare the original index's parity with the position's parity.\n\nSo the key is to sort the array of structs (val, idx) by val.\n\nImplementing an efficient sort in Fortran for this is necessary. Given that N can be up to 1e5, a bubble sort is O(N^2), which is 1e10 operations and would be too slow. So we need an O(N log N) sort.\n\nThus, we need to implement a quicksort or merge sort for the derived type array.\n\nLet's implement a quicksort.\n\nHere's a possible quicksort implementation for the derived type array:\n\nrecursive subroutine quicksort(a, first, last)\n    type(element), intent(inout) :: a(:)\n    integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n    integer :: pivot, i, j\n    type(element) :: temp\n\n    if (first < last) then\n        pivot = first\n        i = first\n        j = last\n        do\n            do while (a(i)%val < a(pivot)%val)\n                i = i + 1\n            end do\n            do while (a(j)%val > a(pivot)%val)\n                j = j - 1\n            end do\n            if (i >= j) exit\n            temp = a(i)\n            a(i) = a(j)\n            a(j) = temp\n            if (pivot == j) pivot = i\n            if (pivot == i) pivot = j\n            i = i + 1\n            j = j - 1\n        end do\n        call quicksort(a, first, pivot-1)\n        call quicksort(a, pivot+1, last)\n    end if\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nBut this is a basic quicksort implementation. However, for large N (like 1e5), it may be stack-heavy due to recursion. So perhaps an iterative quicksort or a different algorithm would be better. But for the purpose of this code, perhaps the quicksort will suffice.\n\nBut Fortran may have stack issues with deep recursion. An alternative is to use the built-in sort from a library, but assuming that's not available, we need to proceed.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n- Read N.\n\n- Allocate an array of elements (val, idx), with idx being 0-based.\n\n- Fill the array.\n\n- Sort it using quicksort by val.\n\n- Iterate through the sorted array, for each element i (1-based), compute pos = i-1 (0-based), check if pos mod 2 != idx mod 2. If so, increment diff.\n\n- Answer is diff / 2.\n\nNow, implement this in Fortran.\n\nBut also, in the Java code, the HashMap uses the value as the key, so if there are duplicate values, the code would overwrite the indices and process the last occurrence of the value. But again, assuming all values are unique.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work as long as all input values are unique. If there are duplicates, the code may not work correctly, but that's the same as the original Java code.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe code would look like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n\n    type element\n        integer :: val\n        integer :: idx\n    end type element\n\n    integer :: N, i, diff, pos\n    type(element), allocatable :: arr(:)\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*, *) N\n    allocate(arr(N))\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*, *) arr(i)%val\n        arr(i)%idx = i - 1  ! 0-based index\n    end do\n\n    ! Sort the array by val\n    call quicksort(arr, 1, N)\n\n    ! Calculate diff\n    diff = 0\n    do i = 1, N\n        pos = i - 1  ! 0-based position in sorted array\n        if (mod(arr(i)%idx, 2) /= mod(pos, 2)) then\n            diff = diff + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the answer\n    print *, diff / 2\n\ncontains\n\n    recursive subroutine quicksort(a, first, last)\n        type(element), intent(inout) :: a(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n        integer :: pivot, i, j\n        type(element) :: temp\n\n        if (first < last) then\n            pivot = (first + last) / 2  ! Choosing middle element as pivot\n            i = first\n            j = last\n            do\n                do while (a(i)%val < a(pivot)%val)\n                    i = i + 1\n                end do\n                do while (a(j)%val > a(pivot)%val)\n                    j = j - 1\n                end do\n                if (i >= j) exit\n                ! Swap a(i) and a(j)\n                temp = a(i)\n                a(i) = a(j)\n                a(j) = temp\n                ! Update pivot if necessary\n                if (pivot == i) then\n                    pivot = j\n                else if (pivot == j) then\n                    pivot = i\n                end if\n                i = i + 1\n                j = j - 1\n            end do\n            call quicksort(a, first, pivot-1)\n            call quicksort(a, pivot+1, last)\n        end if\n    end subroutine quicksort\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but the quicksort subroutine here uses the middle element as the pivot. But the partitioning logic may need to be adjusted. Alternatively, perhaps use the first element as the pivot. But regardless, this quicksort implementation needs to correctly sort the array.\n\nHowever, this implementation may have bugs. For example, the pivot choice and the do-while loops may not correctly partition the array. Another approach is to use a different partitioning scheme.\n\nAlternatively, use a different sorting algorithm like merge sort, but that's more code.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran pack() function and implement a functional-style quicksort. But for efficiency, that's not recommended.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps proceed with the quicksort as written, but test it.\n\nAlternatively, in the original Java code, the PriorityQueue is a min-heap, so the sorted array is in ascending order. Thus, the Fortran code's sort must sort the array in ascending order of val.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the Fortran code, the quicksort subroutine is written to take first and last as indices. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so the initial call is quicksort(arr, 1, N).\n\nBut the pivot selection is (first + last)/2, which is the middle element. Then, the code moves i to the right until a[i] >= pivot_val, and j to the left until a[j] <= pivot_val. Then swap a[i] and a[j], and proceed until i >= j. Then, recursively sort the partitions.\n\nThis should work, but perhaps the quicksort implementation has bugs. To avoid that, perhaps we can use the built-in sort function for integers and track the indices.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWait, another approach: create an array of indices sorted based on the corresponding values. For example:\n\n- Have an array indices where indices(i) is the original index (0-based) of the i-th element in sorted order.\n\nBut to get this, we can create an array of original indices, then sort them based on the values.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: indices(:), values(:)\nallocate(indices(N), values(N))\ndo i=1,N\n    read(*,*) values(i)\nend do\nindices = [(i-1, i=1, N)]  ! 0-based indices\n\ncall sort_indices_by_values(indices, values)\n\nThen, after sorting, indices(i) gives the original index of the element that is in the i-th position (1-based) in the sorted array. So, for each i in 1..N, the original index is indices(i), and the position in the sorted array is i-1 (0-based). Then, compare (indices(i) % 2) with ((i-1) % 2).\n\nThis way, we can avoid using derived types and focus on sorting the indices based on the values.\n\nTo implement this, we need a way to sort the indices array based on the values array.\n\nHere's how the sort_indices_by_values subroutine could work:\n\nsubroutine sort_indices_by_values(indices, values)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: indices(:)\n    integer, intent(in) :: values(:)\n    ! Implement a sort (e.g., quicksort) that sorts the indices array based on the values array.\n    ! The comparison is done by comparing values(indices(i)) and values(indices(j)).\n\n    ! Implement a quicksort on indices based on values(indices)\n    call quicksort_indices(indices, 1, size(indices), values)\nend subroutine\n\nrecursive subroutine quicksort_indices(indices, first, last, values)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: indices(:)\n    integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n    integer, intent(in) :: values(:)\n    integer :: pivot, i, j, temp, pivot_val\n\n    if (first < last) then\n        pivot = (first + last) / 2\n        pivot_val = values(indices(pivot))\n        i = first\n        j = last\n        do\n            do while (values(indices(i)) < pivot_val)\n                i = i + 1\n            end do\n            do while (values(indices(j)) > pivot_val)\n                j = j - 1\n            end do\n            if (i >= j) exit\n            ! Swap indices[i] and indices[j]\n            temp = indices(i)\n            indices(i) = indices(j)\n            indices(j) = temp\n            i = i + 1\n            j = j - 1\n        end do\n        call quicksort_indices(indices, first, j, values)\n        call quicksort_indices(indices, j+1, last, values)\n    end if\nend subroutine quicksort_indices\n\nThis way, the indices array is sorted such that values(indices(1)) <= values(indices(2)) <= ... <= values(indices(N)).\n\nThen, in the main program:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, diff, pos\n    integer, allocatable :: values(:), indices(:)\n\n    read(*, *) N\n    allocate(values(N), indices(N))\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*, *) values(i)\n    end do\n\n    !

The sort is done on the indices array based on the values. This should be more efficient and easier to manage.\n\nThis code should work correctly. Let's test it with sample inputs.\n\nFor example, if the input is:\n\n3\n2 3 1\n\nThe original indices (0-based) are 0,1,2.\n\nThe sorted values are 1,2,3. The original indices of these values are 2,0,1.\n\nThe positions in the sorted array are 0,1,2.\n\nCompare each original index's parity and position's parity:\n\n1. i=1 (sorted pos 0):\n\noriginal index is 2 \u2192 0 mod 2. pos 0 mod 2 \u2192 0. Same. No diff.\n\nWait, no. Wait, original index is 2 \u2192 2 mod 2 is 0. pos is 0 mod 2 is 0. So same. No diff.\n\n2. i=2 (sorted pos 1):\n\noriginal index is 0 \u2192 0 mod 2 \u2192 0. pos 1 mod 2 \u2192 1. Different. diff +=1.\n\n3. i=3 (sorted pos 2):\n\noriginal index is 1 \u2192 1 mod 2 \u2192 1. pos 2 mod 2 \u2192 0. Different. diff +=1.\n\nTotal diff is 2. ans = 2/2 = 1.\n\nWhich is correct. Because we need one swap: swap 3 and 1, for example. But according to the code's logic, the answer is 1.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nAnother test case:\n\n4\n4 3 2 1\n\nOriginal indices (0-based) 0,1,2,3.\n\nSorted values: 1,2,3,4. Original indices 3,2,1,0.\n\nPositions 0,1,2,3.\n\nCheck each:\n\ni=1 (pos 0): original index 3 \u2192 1. pos 0 \u2192 0. Diff. \u2192 diff +=1.\n\ni=2 (pos 1): original index 2 \u2192 0. pos 1 \u2192 1. Diff. \u2192 diff +=1.\n\ni=3 (pos 2): original index 1 \u2192 1. pos 2 \u2192 0. Diff. \u2192 diff +=1.\n\ni=4 (pos 3): original index 0 \u2192 0. pos 3 \u2192 1. Diff. \u2192 diff +=1.\n\nTotal diff is 4. ans = 4/2=2.\n\nSo the answer is 2 swaps.\n\nYes, because the pairs are (0 and 3), (1 and 2). Each swap fixes two mismatches.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, this Fortran code should correctly translate the Java code."
