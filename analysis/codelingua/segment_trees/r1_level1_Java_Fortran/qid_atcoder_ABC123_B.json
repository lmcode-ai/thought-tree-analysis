    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nLooking at the code, it's for a problem where there are five numbers, and the goal is to calculate the minimum total time considering that when you order dishes, the next dish can start only after the current one is done. The key is handling the remainders when divided by 10. The dish with the largest remainder (or equivalently, the smallest 10 - remainder) should be processed last to minimize the waiting time.\n\nThe Java code uses a TreeMap to sort the dishes based on their \"b\" value, which is 10 - (a[i] %10), if the remainder is not zero. Then, it processes all dishes except the one with the largest 'b' (which is last in the TreeMap) by adding their adjusted times (rounded up to the next multiple of 10) and then adds the last dish's actual time.\n\nSo, the steps in the Java code are:\n\n1. Read five integers.\n2. For each integer, calculate its remainder when divided by 10. If the remainder isn't zero, compute 10 - remainder (b) and store in a TreeMap with 'b' as the key and the original value. This TreeMap is sorted, so the last key is the largest b, which corresponds to the dish that should be processed last.\n3. If all dishes have no remainder (i.e., map is empty), sum all and return.\n4. Otherwise, find the dish with the largest b (last entry in the map) and process it last. The other dishes are adjusted to the next multiple of 10 (if needed) and summed, then add the last dish's value.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the steps again.\n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have a built-in TreeMap, so we need to find another way to track which dish has the largest 'b' value (10 - remainder). Since there are only five elements, perhaps we can manually track the maximum 'b' and the corresponding index or value.\n\nLet's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read five integers into an array a(5).\n2. For each element in a, compute r = mod(a(i),10). If r is not zero, compute b = 10 - r. Otherwise, b is 10? Wait, no. Looking at the Java code: if r !=0, then b is 10 - r, else they put into the map (but only if r is not zero). Wait, in the Java code, when r is zero, the code doesn't add to the map. The map only contains entries for a[i] where r is not zero.\n\nThe TreeMap is used to track the a[i] with their corresponding b values (10 - r) only when r is not zero. Then, the last key in the TreeMap (since it's sorted) is the largest b. The idea is that this dish has the largest possible remainder (since 10 - r is largest when r is smallest non-zero), so processing it last saves the most time.\n\nSo in Fortran, without a TreeMap, perhaps we can track the maximum 'b' value and the corresponding a[i]. But we need to consider that multiple dishes could have the same 'b' value, but the TreeMap will overwrite entries with the same key, but in the Java code, the keys are the 'b's and the values are the a[i]s. However, since the TreeMap is sorted, the last entry (largest key) is the one with the largest 'b'. So, in Java, if two entries have the same 'b', the later one will overwrite the previous in the TreeMap. But in Fortran, we need to track the maximum 'b' and the corresponding a[i].\n\nBut perhaps the problem allows that, as any dish with the maximum 'b' can be chosen as the last one. Wait, but in the Java code, if two dishes have the same 'b', which one is chosen as the last? For example, two dishes with the same 'b' would have the same key in the TreeMap, and the later one (since when you put into the map, the same key replaces the existing entry) would be stored. So in the Java code, the last dish in the array with the maximum 'b' would be the one kept in the map.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, perhaps we can loop through all the dishes, track the maximum 'b' and the last occurrence of that maximum 'b' (so that if there are multiple dishes with the same maximum 'b', the last one is chosen as the one to process last).\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to select any dish with the maximum 'b' (since all of them would have the same 10 - r, so their r is same), but the code in Java uses the last occurrence in the array.\n\nSo, in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nLoop through each of the 5 elements:\n\n- compute r = mod(a(i), 10)\n- if r ==0, then b = 0? Or no. Wait, in the Java code, if r is zero, then the code does not add to the TreeMap. So in the TreeMap, only the elements with r !=0 are present. Then, when the TreeMap is empty, all elements are multiples of 10, so sum them all.\n\nSo, for each a(i), compute r = mod(a(i),10). If r !=0, then compute b = 10 - r, and track these elements. The maximum 'b' among these is the key, and the corresponding a(i) is the one to process last.\n\nSo in Fortran, steps:\n\nRead the 5 numbers into array a.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nmax_b = -1\n\nlast_a = 0\n\nsum_ans = 0\n\ncount_nonzero_remainder = 0\n\nThen, for each a(i):\n\nr = mod(a(i), 10)\n\nif (r /= 0) then:\n\n   count_nonzero_remainder = count_nonzero_remainder +1\n\n   b = 10 - r\n\n   if (b > max_b) then:\n\n      max_b = b\n\n      last_a = a(i)\n\n   else if (b == max_b) then:\n\n      ! if current a(i) is the same as existing max_b, replace?\n\n      ! but in Java, the TreeMap would replace the entry if same key.\n\n      ! So in the Java code, for the same b, the later a(i) would be stored.\n\n      ! So in Fortran, we need to track the last a(i) with the same max_b.\n\n      last_a = a(i)\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nThen, after processing all 5 elements:\n\nIf count_nonzero_remainder is zero (i.e., all r ==0), then sum all a(i) and output.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to sum all a(i) except the last_a (but wait, how to know which a(i) was the last one with max_b?), but wait, in the code, the last_a is the one that is the last a(i) with the maximum 'b' value.\n\nBut in the code, the Java code's approach is to find the index of the last occurrence of 'last_a' in the array. Wait, in the Java code:\n\nOnce the map is built, the code retrieves the last entry (map.lastKey()) and gets the value, which is the a[i] stored. Then, it loops through the array to find the index of that value. But if there are multiple a[i] with the same value, this could be incorrect. Wait, but in the problem statement, the input may have duplicate a[i]s. For example, two dishes with the same time. So in that case, the code would pick the first occurrence? Or the last occurrence?\n\nWait, in the Java code, when building the TreeMap, if two a[i]s have the same 'b' value (so same key), then the later one in the array will overwrite the earlier one. So the map will have only one entry per 'b' key, with the last a[i] in the array with that 'b'. Then, when retrieving the last key (the largest 'b'), the value stored is the last a[i] in the array with that 'b' value. Then, the code finds the index of that a[i] in the array. If there are multiple a[i]s with the same value as last_a, then the code will pick the last occurrence. For example, if the array has two elements with the same value as last_a, the code will assign idx to the last one (since it loops from 0 to 4, and overwrites idx each time a[i] matches last_a). So in the Java code, the idx is the last occurrence of last_a in the array.\n\nBut this could be a problem if two different dishes have the same value but different remainders. For example, two a[i]s with same value but different r? Not possible. Because the value is same, the mod 10 is same, so their 'b' would be same. But in the TreeMap, the last occurrence overwrites the first.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem's context, the dishes are all different, but the code in Java may have this edge case. However, the code seems to rely on the presence of the last_a in the array.\n\nSo, in Fortran, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Find all a[i] with r !=0, track the maximum 'b' (10 - r), and among those with maximum 'b', track the last occurrence (in the array) of such a[i].\n\n2. Then, in the sum, process all a[i] except that particular occurrence, adding (a[i] + (10 - r) if r !=0), else add a[i], and then add the last_a.\n\nSo, the key is to find the a[i] which is to be processed last. That is the a[i] with the largest 'b' (if any). And if multiple, the last such a[i] in the array.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nLoop through each a(i):\n\nCompute r = mod(a(i),10)\n\nIf r is not zero:\n\n   b = 10 - r\n\n   if (b > current_max_b) OR (b == current_max_b and this a(i) comes later than previous max):\n\n       update current_max_b to b\n\n       save the index i as last_idx\n\nElse:\n\n   if (r ==0):\n\n      do nothing (since these are processed as sum += a[i])\n\nSo, but how to track the last occurrence of the maximum 'b'?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nInitialize max_b to 0.\n\nInitialize last_idx to -1.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to 5:\n\nr = mod(a(i), 10)\n\nif (r /=0) then:\n\n   b = 10 - r\n\n   if (b > max_b) then:\n\n      max_b = b\n\n      last_idx = i\n\n   else if (b == max_b) then:\n\n      if (i > last_idx) then:\n\n         last_idx = i\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nAfter processing all elements, if max_b is still 0 (i.e., no elements with r !=0), then sum all.\n\nElse:\n\nsum all a[i] except a[last_idx], adding (if their r is 0, then a[i], else a[i] + (10 - r)).\n\nThen add a[last_idx] (without adding anything, because it's processed last).\n\nSo this would replicate the Java code's logic.\n\nNow, let's code this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, read 5 integers. In Fortran, we can read into an array:\n\ninteger :: a(5)\n\ndo i = 1, 5\n\n   read(*,*) a(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen compute r for each a(i).\n\nInitialize variables:\n\ninteger :: max_b = 0\n\ninteger :: last_idx = -1\n\ninteger :: i, r, b\n\nThen loop through each element:\n\ndo i = 1, 5\n\n   r = mod(a(i), 10)\n\n   if (r /= 0) then\n\n      b = 10 - r\n\n      if (b > max_b) then\n\n         max_b = b\n\n         last_idx = i\n\n      else if (b == max_b) then\n\n         if (i > last_idx) then\n\n            last_idx = i\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, if max_b is 0 (but wait, max_b starts at 0, and if all elements have r=0, then max_b remains 0 and last_idx remains -1. But wait, in the loop, if r is 0, then the code skips. So if all r are 0, then max_b remains 0 and last_idx remains -1. So how to detect that case?\n\nWait, in this code, if all r are 0, then max_b remains 0, and last_idx remains -1. But in the Java code, the TreeMap is empty, which is the case when all a[i] have r=0. So in that case, sum all.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, the condition is: if (last_idx == -1) then sum all.\n\nWait, no. Because if all a[i] have r=0, then during the loop, the code does not process any elements (since r=0), so last_idx remains -1. So after the loop, if last_idx is -1, then all elements have r=0, so sum all. Else, proceed to calculate the sum.\n\nSo:\n\nif (last_idx == -1) then\n\n   ans = sum(a)\n\nelse\n\n   ans = 0\n\n   do i = 1,5\n\n      if (i == last_idx) cycle\n\n      r = mod(a(i),10)\n\n      if (r ==0) then\n\n          ans = ans + a(i)\n\n      else\n\n          ans = ans + a(i) + (10 - r)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   ans = ans + a(last_idx)\n\nend if\n\nThen print ans.\n\nBut wait, the Java code uses the last occurrence of the a[i] that has the largest 'b' (even if other a[i]s have the same value but different 'b's, but that's impossible because the same a[i] would have the same mod 10. So, for example, if a[i] is 21, then r=1, b=9. If another a[j] is 31, r=1, b=9. Both would have same b. So in the Fortran code, if i is after j, then last_idx is set to i. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code should handle that.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase 1: All a[i]s are multiples of 10. Then sum them all.\n\nCase 2: At least one a[i] is not a multiple of 10. Then process the last a[i] with maximum 'b' (10 - r) as the last dish, and others are rounded up to next multiple of 10.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle this.\n\nTesting with sample input. Let's take the sample input from the problem (if any). But since I don't have the original problem statement, perhaps we can test with the code.\n\nBut perhaps the Java code was written for ABC123 B problem. Let me check.\n\nLooking up ABC123 B problem.\n\nProblem B: Five Dishes\n\nThe problem statement is:\n\nWe have five dishes. Each dish takes A_i minutes to cook. When you start cooking a dish, you can't start another until it's done. However, you can choose the order. When you finish cooking a dish, if the time is not a multiple of 10, you wait until the next multiple of 10 to start the next dish. Find the minimum possible total time (sum of cooking times plus waiting times).\n\nSo, for example, if you cook a dish that ends at 123 seconds, the next dish starts at 130.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to choose the dish with the smallest remainder (when divided by 10) to be last, so that the waiting time for others is minimized.\n\nWait, no: the dish with the largest remainder (mod 10) will have the least waiting time. Because if a dish ends at, say, 24 (mod 10 is 4), then you have to wait 6 units for the next. But if you process this dish last, you don't need to wait after it. So, the dish with the largest remainder (mod 10) should be processed last. For example, a dish with time 24: remainder 4. So, when processed last, no wait. So the total time would be 24. But if processed earlier, you add 6 to the total time.\n\nThus, the strategy is to process the dish with the largest remainder (mod 10) last. However, if a dish's time is a multiple of 10, its remainder is zero, so there's no waiting after it. But such dishes can be processed any time except possibly the last, but since their remainder is zero, they don't contribute any waiting time.\n\nWait, the problem's waiting time is only when the dish's end time is not a multiple of 10. For example, if a dish takes 24 seconds (ends at 24), the next dish starts at 30. So the waiting time is 6. But if that dish is processed last, then there's no next dish, so the waiting time is zero.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to process the dish with the largest remainder (mod 10) last, so that the waiting time after it is zero. All other dishes are adjusted to the next multiple of 10. Except for the ones with remainder zero, which don't need adjustment.\n\nBut the code in Java seems to compute for each dish, the adjusted time (a[i] + (10 - r[i]) if r[i] !=0), except for the last dish. Then sum all adjusted times of non-last dishes plus the last dish's original time.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should correctly handle this.\n\nTesting with sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n29\n\n20\n\n7\n\n35\n\n3\n\nThe remainders are:\n\n29 mod10 =9 \u2192 b=1\n\n20 mod10=0 \u2192 no b.\n\n7 mod10=7 \u2192 b=3\n\n35 mod10=5 \u2192b=5\n\n3 mod10=3 \u2192b=7\n\nSo the 'b's are 1,3,5,7. The maximum b is 7 (from 3). So the last dish is 3. Then the sum is:\n\nAdjust all except 3:\n\n29 \u2192 29 +1 =30\n\n20 \u219220 (no adjustment)\n\n7 \u21927 +3=10\n\n35 \u219235+5=40\n\nSum these adjusted: 30+20+10+40 =100. Then add the last dish 3 \u2192 total 103.\n\nWhich is the correct answer.\n\nIn Java code, the TreeMap will have entries for 29 (b=1),7 (b=3),35 (b=5),3 (b=7). The lastKey() is 7, value is 3. Then sum others (adjusted) plus 3.\n\nSo the Fortran code should output 103.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nInput all 10s: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10 \u2192 sum 50.\n\nIf all are multiples of 10, then sum 50.\n\nAnother sample input: 11, 11, 11, 11, 11.\n\nEach has r=1 \u2192 b=9. The last occurrence is the fifth 11. So sum the first four adjusted to 20 each (11+9=20), plus the fifth 11. Total 4*20 +11= 80+11=91.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, writing the code in Fortran.\n\nFirst, read the five integers.\n\nThen compute max_b and last_idx.\n\nThen compute the sum.\n\nPossible code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: a(5), i, r, b, max_b, last_idx, ans\n    logical :: found_non_zero\n\n    ! Read input\n    do i = 1, 5\n        read(*,*) a(i)\n    end do\n\n    max_b = 0\n    last_idx = -1\n\n    do i = 1, 5\n        r = mod(a(i), 10)\n        if (r /= 0) then\n            b = 10 - r\n            if (b > max_b .or. (b == max_b .and. i > last_idx)) then\n                max_b = b\n                last_idx = i\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (last_idx == -1) then\n        ! All are multiples of 10\n        ans = sum(a)\n    else\n        ans = 0\n        do i = 1, 5\n            if (i == last_idx) cycle\n            r = mod(a(i), 10)\n            if (r == 0) then\n                ans = ans + a(i)\n            else\n                ans = ans + a(i) + (10 - r)\n            end if\n        end do\n        ans = ans + a(last_idx)\n    end if\n\n    print '(i0)', ans\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the condition for updating last_idx:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nif (b > max_b .or. (b == max_b .and. i > last_idx)) then\n\nBut initially, max_b is 0 and last_idx is -1.\n\nFor example, when i=1, and b is 1 (from r=9), then since max_b is 0, b>max_b is true. So set max_b to 1, last_idx to 1.\n\nIf then, at i=5, b is 1 again. Then, since b == max_b (1) and i=5 > last_idx=1, condition is true. So update last_idx to 5.\n\nThis correctly tracks the last occurrence of the max_b.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nBut in Fortran, the logical operators have precedence. However, in this case, the code uses .or., and the expressions are properly grouped. So, the condition is:\n\nIf either (b > max_b) or (b == max_b and i > last_idx).\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input 1:\n\nInput:\n\n29\n\n20\n\n7\n\n35\n\n3\n\nThe array is [29,20,7,35,3].\n\nProcessing each element:\n\ni=1: r=29 mod10=9, b=1. Since max_b is 0, update to max_b=1, last_idx=1.\n\ni=2: r=0 \u2192 skip.\n\ni=3: r=7 \u2192 b=3. Since 3>1, update max_b=3, last_idx=3.\n\ni=4: r=5 \u2192b=5>3 \u2192 update to max_b=5, last_idx=4.\n\ni=5: r=3 \u2192b=7>5 \u2192 update to max_b=7, last_idx=5.\n\nThus, last_idx=5. So sum all except a(5).\n\nFor i=1: r=9 !=0 \u2192 add 29 +1 =30.\n\ni=2: r=0 \u2192 add 20.\n\ni=3: r=7 \u2192 add 7+3=10.\n\ni=4: r=5 \u2192 add 35+5=40.\n\nSum these: 30+20+10+40=100. Then add a(5)=3 \u2192 total 103.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case where two dishes have the same b. For example:\n\na = [11, 21, 31, 41, 51]\n\nEach has r=1, 1, 1, 1, 1 \u2192 b=9,9,9,9,9.\n\nThe last_idx should be 5. So sum all except 5th dish:\n\nEach adjusted to 20 (11+9=20, etc.). Sum of 20*4=80, plus 51 \u219280+51=131.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case where two dishes have the same max_b but different values.\n\nFor example, a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. All r=3 \u2192 b=7. So last_idx=5. Sum the first four adjusted to 3+7=10 each: 4*10=40, plus 3 \u219243.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work."
