    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nThe code reads two integers, n and k. Then it initializes l as 0 and c as 1. It loops n times, reading an integer a each time. If a is equal to l, it increments c by 1; otherwise, it resets c to 1. Then it sets l to a. After the loop, if c + k is greater than n, it prints n - c; else, it prints -1.\n\nWait, so the idea is to count the number of consecutive elements at the end of the input list. Because each iteration compares the current a with the previous one (stored in l), and c tracks the current streak. So after processing all elements, c is the count of the last consecutive duplicates.\n\nThen, the condition checks if the sum of c (the streak length) and k is greater than n. If so, output n - c, else -1.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to replicate this logic.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses static typing, so variables need to be declared. Let's see:\n\nVariables in Java: n, k, l, c, i, a.\n\nIn Fortran, we'll need to declare these. Let's note their types. All integers here, so INTEGER.\n\nThe code reads from standard input. In Fortran, we use READ(*,*) to read from input.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read n and k from input.\n\n2. Initialize l to 0, c to 1.\n\n3. Loop from i=1 to n (since Java uses 0-based, but in Fortran loops can start from 1 to n).\n\n4. Read a in each iteration.\n\n5. Compare a with l. If equal, increment c; else, set c to 1.\n\n6. Update l to a.\n\nAfter the loop, check if (c + k) > n. If true, output n - c. Else, output -1.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, after reading the inputs, how do we read the a's? Because the input is a list of n numbers. So for example, the input would be something like:\n\nn k\n\na1 a2 a3 ... an\n\nSo in Java, the loop reads each a as nextInt() in sequence.\n\nIn Fortran, the same approach: after reading n and k, read the next n integers.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nRead n, k\n\nThen read a sequence of n integers. So perhaps in a loop, read each integer one by one.\n\nBut in Java's code, each a is read inside the loop. So in Fortran, the same: in a do loop from 1 to n, read a each time.\n\nWait, but when using READ(*,*), it will read from the same line or next lines. So if the input is given as all in one line, the code needs to read them correctly. But in the Java code, each a is read sequentially, so in Fortran, reading each a in a loop should work.\n\nNow, the Fortran code structure would be:\n\nPROGRAM main\n\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER :: n, k, l, c, i, a\n\nREAD(*,*) n, k\n\nl = 0\n\nc = 1\n\nDO i = 1, n\n\n    READ(*,*) a\n\n    IF (a == l) THEN\n\n        c = c + 1\n\n    ELSE\n\n        c = 1\n\n    END IF\n\n    l = a\n\nEND DO\n\nIF (c + k > n) THEN\n\n    PRINT *, n - c\n\nELSE\n\n    PRINT *, -1\n\nEND IF\n\nEND PROGRAM\n\nWait, but in Java, the initial value of l is 0. So the first a (when i=0) is compared to l (0). Wait, the first iteration in Java's loop (i starts at 0, runs n times). So in the first iteration, a is read. Then compared to l (initialized to 0). So if the first a is 0, then c becomes 2. Otherwise, c is 1. Then l is set to a.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, the loop runs from 1 to n. Each iteration reads a, compares to previous l (initialized to 0), then updates l. So the logic is the same as the Java code.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSuppose input:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nJava code:\n\nIn the loop, first a=1. l is 0, so a != l. c becomes 1. l =1.\n\nSecond a=1: a == l, c=2.\n\nThird a=1: c=3.\n\nFourth: c=4.\n\nFifth: c=5.\n\nThen c +k=5+2=7>5? 7>5 is true. So output 5-5=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn Fortran code, same steps. So output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, k=3.\n\nInput: 3 3\n\n1 2 3.\n\nIn Java:\n\nl starts at 0. c=1.\n\nFirst a=1: !=0 \u2192 c=1. l=1. c now 1.\n\nSecond a=2: !=1 \u2192 c=1. l=2.\n\nThird a=3: !=2 \u2192 c=1. l=3.\n\nAt end, c=1. c+k=4>3? yes. Output 3-1=2.\n\nBut according to Java code's logic, if c +k >n, output n -c. So 1+3=4>3 \u2192 output 3-1=2.\n\nBut the Java code's condition is if (c +k >n) then output n -c. Else -1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the Fortran code should work.\n\nAnother case: n=4, k=1.\n\nInput: 4 1\n\n1 1 2 2.\n\nProcessing:\n\na=1 (first iteration):\n\na != l (0) \u2192 c=1. l=1.\n\nSecond a=1: equal to l \u2192 c=2.\n\nThird a=2: not equal \u2192 c=1. l=2.\n\nFourth a=2: equal \u2192 c=2.\n\nAfter loop, c=2.\n\nc +k= 2+1=3>4? 3>4 is no. So output -1.\n\nSo code outputs -1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the Fortran code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
