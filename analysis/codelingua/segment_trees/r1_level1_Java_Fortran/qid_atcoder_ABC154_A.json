So if the first line is \"hello there\", then str[0] is \"hello\", and if the third line is \"hello\", then u.equals(str[0]) is true. But if the third line is \"hello \", then it's false. So in Fortran, the third line must be read as the entire line, not just a token. So in Fortran, the third line should be read as a character variable, including all characters except the newline. So in Fortran, for the third line, u should be read using a formatted read to get the entire line. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: u\nread(*, '(a)') u\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read into a character variable with a format of '(a)', it will read the entire line, but if the variable's length is longer than the line, it will be filled with spaces. So for example, if the line is \"red\", then u will be \"red\" followed by 97 spaces (assuming len=100).",

But in Fortran, after reading into a fixed-length variable, the variable contains \"s \" followed by spaces. So the actual data is \"s \" followed by spaces. But when comparing to s1, which is \"s\" followed by spaces, the comparison is true. Thus, the problem remains. So perhaps the solution is to read the third line into a variable, and then process it to get the exact string (without the trailing spaces added by Fortran's padding).",

So to compare this to s1, which is \"s\" (length 1), the code must compare the first two characters of u against s1's first two characters. But this is not feasible. So perhaps the correct approach is to read the third line into a variable, then trim trailing spaces (so that \"s \" becomes \"s \" with no trailing spaces beyond the input), then compare with s1.

So if the third line is \"s \", u is \"s \", and str[0] is \"s\", then equals() is false. But in the Fortran code, comparing u(1:u_len) (which is \"s \") to s1_trimmed (which is \"s\") would be \"s \" vs \"s\" \u2192 not equal. So that's correct. But how to compare these two substrings in Fortran. In Fortran, you can compare substrings:\n\nif (u(1:u_len) == trim(s1)) then ...\n\nBut trim(s1) would remove trailing spaces from s1, which is already the first token (so no trailing spaces except the padding). So trim(s1) is the same as s1_trimmed.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The program reads some input, processes it, and outputs a result based on a condition.\n\nFirst, looking at the Java code: it reads a line using BufferedReader, splits it into a string array. Then uses a StringTokenizer to read the next line, parsing two integers a and b. Then reads another line for the string u. The output depends on whether u equals the first element of the initial string array. If so, it decrements a by 1, else decrements b by 1, and prints both numbers.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFortran uses read statements for input. Let's see:\n\n1. Read the first line and split into two strings. In Java, str is the array from splitting the first line. So in Fortran, I can read the first line into a character variable, then split into two parts. But how to split in Fortran? Maybe using the index function to find the space and then extract substrings.\n\nWait, the first line in Java is split into str, which is probably two words. For example, if the first line is \"red blue\", then str[0] is \"red\", str[1] is \"blue\".\n\nThen the next line is two integers, a and b. So read those into variables a and b.\n\nThen the third line is a string u. The output checks if u equals str[0]. If yes, then a-1 and b. Else, a and b-1.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read the first line into a string, split into two parts (s1 and s2).\n- Read the next line into a and b.\n- Read the third line into u.\n- Compare u with s1. If equal, print a-1 and b. Else, print a and b-1.\n\nNow, let's handle the splitting of the first line. Suppose the first line is two words separated by a space. So in Fortran, we can read the entire line into a string, then find the position of the space. The first part is from 1 to pos-1, the second part is pos+1 to end.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: line\nread(*, '(a)') line\npos = index(line, ' ')\ns1 = line(1:pos-1)\ns2 = line(pos+1:)\n\nBut in Fortran, variable-length strings are tricky. So maybe declare s1 and s2 with sufficient length, like len=100.\n\nThen, reading a and b: the next line is two integers. So read them using a simple read statement.\n\nread(*,*) a, b\n\nThen read u as another line.\n\nread(*, '(a)') u\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when using list-directed input (like read(*,*)), leading and trailing spaces are skipped. But if the input is a single word, that's okay. But if the user enters leading spaces, that might be a problem. The Java code uses readLine(), which includes any leading/trailing spaces except the newline. Hmm. But perhaps in the problem's test cases, u is a single token, so using read(*, '(a)') would read the entire line, including spaces. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, in Java, when you call in.readLine() for u, it's the entire line, including leading and trailing spaces (except the newline). So in Fortran, reading the third line as a character variable should capture exactly that. So using read(*, '(a)') u would read the entire line, but in Fortran, the '(a)' format reads as much as possible, but trailing spaces are considered as part of the string. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nActually, when using the '(a)' format specifier without a width, it reads the entire line, including leading and trailing spaces. So when you do:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: u\nread(*, '(a)') u\n\nIt will read the entire line, but the variable u is a fixed-length string. If the input line is shorter than 100 characters, then the rest is filled with spaces. For example, if the input is \"red\", then u will be \"red\" followed by 97 spaces. Comparing this to s1, which is the first part of the first line (also read with the same method) would need to trim trailing spaces. Oh wait, but in the Java code, the comparison is u.equals(str[0]), which is exact, including case and all characters. So in Fortran, if s1 is \"red\" and the user inputs \"red \", then the Java code would consider them unequal, but in Fortran, if we read with '(a)', the u variable would have trailing spaces, and comparing to s1 (which may have trailing spaces after the split) might not match.\n\nWait, this could be a problem. Because in the Java code, the first line is split into tokens using split(\" \"), which splits on any whitespace. So the first token is the first word, and the second is the next. So in the first line, the input is two words separated by one or more spaces. The split(\" \") would split on each space, but the actual split in Java may result in multiple empty tokens if there are multiple spaces, but in practice, the code in Java is using split(\" \") and then taking the first two elements, so if the first line has more than two words, str[0] and str[1] would be the first two. But in the given code, the first line is split into str, but the code uses str[0] and doesn't use str[1] except in the output. Wait, no, looking back at the code:\n\nThe Java code's line:\n\nString[] str = in.readLine().split(\" \");\n\nThen, in the output:\n\nu.equals(str[0]) ? ... \n\nSo str[0] is the first word of the first line. So in Fortran, after splitting the first line into s1 and s2, we need s1 to be the first word, s2 the second. But if the first line has multiple spaces between them, the split in Java would result in multiple empty strings. For example, if the first line is \"  hello   world  \", split(\" \") would produce [\"\", \"\", \"hello\", \"\", \"\", \"world\", \"\", ...], so str[0] is empty, str[1] is empty, etc. But that's a problem. However, the code's original intent may be that the first line is two words separated by a single space. So perhaps the input is well-formed.\n\nBut in the problem statement's context, perhaps the first line is two tokens, so the code splits into two parts. Therefore, in Fortran, splitting on the first space may be sufficient. But if the first line has leading spaces, that's a problem. For example, if the first line is \" red blue\", then split(\" \") would have empty strings, and str[0] is empty. So in Fortran, the code may not handle that. But assuming that the input is well-formed, with two words separated by a single space, then splitting on the first space is okay.\n\nAlternatively, to split on any whitespace and get the first two tokens. But how to do that in Fortran?\n\nAlternatively, read the first line as two separate tokens. For example, read using list-directed input:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s1, s2\nread(*, *) s1, s2\n\nBut list-directed input in Fortran skips leading spaces and reads each token until a space or comma is encountered. So if the first line is \"red blue\", then s1 is \"red\", s2 is \"blue\". If the line is \"  red   blue  \", then s1 and s2 are \"red\" and \"blue\" again. So this approach would capture the first two words, regardless of leading/trailing/multiple spaces, which matches the Java code's split(\" \") plus taking the first two elements. Wait, but in Java, split(\" \") with multiple spaces would generate empty strings, but in practice, the code may assume that the first line has exactly two words separated by a single space. Because otherwise, the code may not work correctly. For example, if the first line is \"a b c\", then str is [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], and str[0] is \"a\", which is correct. But if the code expects exactly two words, then the input is supposed to have two words.\n\nSo perhaps the problem's input is such that the first line has exactly two words separated by a space, and the next line has two integers, and the third line has a single word (either s1 or s2). Therefore, in Fortran, using list-directed input for the first line would capture the first two words. So:\n\nread(*, *) s1, s2\n\nThis would read the first two tokens from the first line, ignoring leading and trailing spaces. Then the next line is read as two integers.\n\nThen, the third line is read as a single token (if using list-directed input), but in Java, u is read as the entire line, including leading and trailing spaces. Wait, no. Java's readLine() reads the entire line except the newline. So u is the entire line, which could contain spaces. For example, if the third line is \"hello world\", then u is \"hello world\", and in Java, the code checks if u equals str[0], which would have to be \"hello world\" in that case.\n\nBut in the code, the third line is compared to str[0], which is the first token from the first line. So if the first line is \"hello there\", then str[0] is \"hello\", and if the third line is \"hello\", then u.equals(str[0]) is true. But if the third line is \"hello \", then it's false. So in Fortran, the third line must be read as the entire line, not just a token. So in Fortran, the third line should be read as a character variable, including all characters except the newline.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the third line, u should be read using a formatted read to get the entire line. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: u\nread(*, '(a)') u\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read into a character variable with a format of '(a)', it will read the entire line, but if the variable's length is longer than the line, it will be filled with spaces. So for example, if the line is \"red\", then u will be \"red\" followed by 97 spaces (assuming len=100). However, in the Java code, u is compared exactly to str[0], which would be the first token from the first line. So in Fortran, s1 (from the first line) is read using list-directed input, which trims leading and trailing spaces. So if the third line's u is read as the entire line (including trailing spaces), then comparing u to s1 (which has trailing spaces stripped?) might not work.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the first line is \"red blue\", then s1 is \"red\", s2 is \"blue\". Because read(*, *) s1, s2 reads the first two tokens. So s1 is \"red\" (without trailing spaces), and s2 is \"blue\". Now, the third line is read as u. Suppose the user enters \"red\", then u is \"red\" followed by 97 spaces (assuming len=100). But s1 is \"red\" (length 3?), but in Fortran, when you compare s1 and u, the comparison is done character by character, up to the length of the shorter string. Wait, no. In Fortran, when comparing strings of different lengths, the shorter one is padded with spaces to match the longer one. So, for example, if s1 is \"red\" (len 3) and u is \"red   \" (len 100), then the comparison s1 == u would check if the first 3 characters are 'red' and the rest are spaces. But in this case, u has 'red' followed by 97 spaces, so when comparing to s1 (length 100?), wait, no: the variables s1 and u are declared as len=100 each. So when you read s1 and s2 using list-directed input, the variables are filled with the tokens, and then padded with spaces. For example, if the first token is \"red\", then s1 would be \"red\" followed by 97 spaces. Similarly, u would be the entire line, e.g., \"red\" followed by 97 spaces. So comparing s1 and u would be equal if the input line is \"red\", because both would have \"red\" followed by spaces. But if the input line is \"red \", then u would have \"red \" followed by 96 spaces, and s1 is \"red\" followed by 97 spaces, so comparing s1 (len=100) and u (len=100) would be comparing each character. The first three are 'r','e','d', then s1 has a space at position 4, while u has a space at position 4 (if the input was \"red \"), so positions 1-4: s1 is 'red ' (4th character is space?), but wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nSuppose s1 is read via list-directed input, which skips leading spaces and reads until the next space. So for example, if the first line is \" red   blue \", then s1 becomes \"red\", s2 becomes \"blue\". Both variables are declared as len=100, so their values are \"red\" followed by 97 spaces and \"blue\" followed by 96 spaces. Then, when the third line is read as u via '(a)', if the user enters \"red\", then u is \"red\" followed by 96 spaces. So comparing s1 (which is \"red\" + 97 spaces) with u (\"red\" + 96 spaces) would compare the first 100 characters. The first three are 'r','e','d', then the fourth to 100th characters are spaces in both. So s1 and u would be equal. However, if the third line is \"red \", then u would be \"red \" followed by 96 spaces. Comparing to s1, which is \"red\" followed by 97 spaces: the fourth character in s1 is space, in u it is space. So again, the first four characters are 'r','e','d',' ' for both. Wait, no. Wait, s1 is \"red\" (3 characters) when read via list-directed input. But since s1 is declared as len=100, the read statement will store the characters as \"red\" followed by 97 spaces. So in s1, the 4th character is space. If u is read via '(a)' as \"red \", then the first four characters are 'r','e','d',' ', followed by 96 spaces. So comparing s1 and u would be 'r','e','d', followed by space in both, and the rest are spaces. So they would be equal. But this depends on how the input is read.\n\nBut the problem is that in Java, the third line is read as the entire line, including trailing spaces. For example, if the third line is \"red \", then u is \"red \", and str[0] is \"red\", so in Java, u.equals(str[0]) is false. But in Fortran, the list-directed input for s1 would have stripped trailing spaces, so s1 is \"red\" plus spaces. Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nIn Java, the first line is split using split(\" \"), which splits on each space. So if the first line is \"red  blue\" (two spaces), then str is [\"red\", \"\", \"blue\"]. So str[0] is \"red\", str[1] is empty string, etc. So the Java code would compare u to \"red\". So in the Java code, if the third line is \"red \", then u is \"red \" (with a space), which is not equal to str[0], which is \"red\" (without space). So the Java code would output a and b-1.\n\nBut in Fortran, if the first line is read using list-directed input, s1 is \"red\", and the third line is read as \"red \" (including the space), then comparing s1 and u would be equal? Because in Fortran, the variables are fixed-length strings, and the trailing spaces are considered in the comparison.\n\nWait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose s1 is declared as character(len=100) and read via list-directed input. If the first token is \"red\", then s1 is \"red\" followed by 97 spaces. The third line is read as \"red \" (with one space and then newline), so u becomes \"red \" followed by 98 spaces (assuming the line is \"red \" followed by a newline). So when comparing s1 and u, Fortran compares all 100 characters. The first three are 'r','e','d' in both. The fourth character in s1 is space, in u is space (from the input). Then all the rest are spaces. So the two variables are equal. But in Java, \"red \" is not equal to \"red\".\n\nThis is a problem. Because in the Java code, the comparison is exact, including the length. So if the third line is \"red \", then u is longer than str[0], which is \"red\", so equals() returns false.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code as written would incorrectly consider \"red\" and \"red \" as equal, which would not be the case in Java.\n\nSo how to fix this?\n\nWe need to compare the actual string entered in the third line (trimmed of trailing spaces?) with the first token of the first line (trimmed of trailing spaces?).\n\nWait, no. In Java, the comparison is u.equals(str[0]). So u is the entire line (without the newline), and str[0] is the first token from the first line. For example, if the first line is \"red blue\", then str[0] is \"red\", and if the third line is \"red\", then u is \"red\" (without any trailing spaces), so equals returns true. If the third line is \"red \", then u is \"red \", which is not equal to \"red\".\n\nBut in Fortran, the way we read the first line (using list-directed input) gives s1 as \"red\" (with trailing spaces to fill the 100 length). Then, the third line is read as u, which includes all characters except the newline, but in Fortran, when read with '(a)', it captures the entire line. However, if the line is shorter than 100 characters, then the rest are filled with spaces.\n\nSo, to replicate the Java code's comparison, we need to compare the third line exactly to the first token of the first line, including any trailing spaces.\n\nWait, no. For example, in Java:\n\nFirst line input: \"red  blue\" (two spaces between red and blue).\n\nsplit(\" \") gives [\"red\", \"\", \"blue\"]. So str[0] is \"red\".\n\nThird line input: \"red \" (one space after red). Then u is \"red \".\n\nSo u.equals(str[0]) is \"red \" vs \"red\" \u2192 false.\n\nBut in Fortran, if s1 is read as the first token (using list-directed input), which is \"red\" (without any trailing spaces), but stored in a variable of length 100, padded with spaces. Then u is read as \"red \" (plus spaces to fill 100). So comparing s1 == u would be \"red followed by 97 spaces\" vs \"red  plus one space then 98 spaces\". The comparison would check all 100 characters. The first three are 'r','e','d'. The fourth character in s1 is space, in u it is space (from the input line's space). Then the rest are spaces. So they would be equal. But in Java, they are not equal. So this is a discrepancy.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code would produce a different result in this case.\n\nTo fix this, we need to compare the trimmed u (without trailing spaces) to the first token (s1) after trimming.\n\nWait, but in Java, trailing spaces in u would matter. For example, if u is \"red \", then equals returns false for \"red\".\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to compare the entire u (including trailing spaces) to the entire s1 (which includes the first token from the first line, but in Java, str[0] is just \"red\" if the first token is \"red\").\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify. The Java code reads the first line and splits it on spaces. So if the first line is \" red   blue \", split on \" \", the array will have [\"\", \"red\", \"\", \"\", \"blue\", \"\"]. So str[0] is the empty string. But the Java code is probably expecting the first line to have exactly two tokens, but if not, the code may have issues.\n\nBut assuming the first line is well-formed, with two tokens separated by spaces. So str[0] is the first token. For example, first line is \"s t\", so str[0] is \"s\".\n\nThen the third line is read as u. If u is \"s\", then output a-1 and b. Else, output a and b-1.\n\nBut in Fortran, if we read s1 using list-directed input, which trims leading and trailing spaces and reads the first token, then s1 is \"s\". The third line is read as u, which includes any leading or trailing spaces. So comparing s1 and u would require trimming u's trailing spaces. Because in Java, u is exactly the line entered, including trailing spaces, but s1 is the first token (no leading/trailing spaces). So to replicate the Java code's equals() comparison, the Fortran code must compare the entire u (without trailing spaces) to s1 (which is the first token, with no leading/trailing spaces). Wait, but in Java, the equals() is between u and str[0], which is the first token. For example, if u is \"s\" \u2192 equal. If u is \"s \" \u2192 not equal.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we need to compare the entire line (u) as read, but without the trailing newline, and without trailing spaces. Or wait, in Java, u is exactly the line, including any trailing spaces except the newline. So if the user enters \"s \", then u is \"s \" (with a space). The str[0] is \"s\" (no space). So equals() returns false.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the code must compare the entire u (without trailing newline) to str[0], but how to handle trailing spaces?\n\nBecause in Fortran, when reading u with '(a)', it captures all characters except the newline, but if the line is shorter than the variable's length, the rest are filled with spaces. So for example, if u is read into a variable of length 100, and the input line is \"s \", then u is \"s \" followed by 98 spaces. But str[0] is \"s\" followed by 99 spaces (assuming s1 is length 100). So comparing them would be \"s \" followed by 98 spaces versus \"s\" followed by 99 spaces. The first character is 's' in both, the second is space in u and ' ' in s1. Wait, no. s1 is \"s\" followed by 99 spaces. u is \"s \" followed by 98 spaces. So the second character is ' ' in both. So the comparison would be equal.\n\nBut in Java, the equals() would return false because the lengths are different. Because in Java, \"s \" has length 2, and \"s\" has length 1.\n\nSo the Fortran code would incorrectly treat \"s \" as equal to \"s\" when comparing with ==, but in Java, they are not equal.\n\nTo fix this, we need to compare the actual strings without trailing spaces. So trim both s1 and u before comparison.\n\nWait, but how? Because in Java, the code is checking the exact string. For example, if the third line is \"s\", then u is \"s\", which equals str[0]. If the third line is \"s \", then u is \"s \", which does not equal str[0] (assuming str[0] is \"s\").\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to replicate this, we need to compare the actual characters entered, including any trailing spaces, but not the Fortran-added padding.\n\nSo the solution is to:\n\n- Read the third line into a variable u, and trim any trailing spaces (since in Fortran, after reading with '(a)', the line is padded with spaces to fill the variable's length). But how to get the exact length of the input line?\n\nAlternatively, process the string u to remove trailing spaces before comparing.\n\nBut in Java, the entire line (including trailing spaces) is considered. For example, if the line is \"s   \" (three spaces), then u is \"s   \" (three spaces), and if str[0] is \"s\", then they are not equal.\n\nBut in Fortran, if we read the line into u as a character variable of length 100, then the variable will have \"s   \" followed by 96 spaces. Comparing to s1 (which is \"s\" followed by 99 spaces) would result in comparing \"s   ...\" (with 3 spaces) versus \"s ...\" (with 99 spaces). The first four characters are 's', space, space, space in u, and 's', space, space, space in s1 (since s1 is \"s\" followed by 99 spaces). Wait, no. s1 is read using list-directed input, which reads the first token, \"s\", and then pads with spaces to fill the variable's length. So s1 is \"s\" followed by 99 spaces. So comparing s1 and u (which is \"s   \" followed by 96 spaces) would have the first four characters as 's', space, space, space in u, and 's', space, space, space in s1. Wait, no. Because s1 has \"s\" followed by 99 spaces. So the first character is 's', then the next 99 are spaces. u has \"s   \" followed by 96 spaces. The first character is 's', then three spaces, then 96 more. So when comparing s1 (100 chars) and u (100 chars), the first four characters are:\n\ns1: 's', ' ', ' ', ' ', ... (all spaces after the first character)\nu: 's', ' ', ' ', ' ', ... (then 96 spaces). So the comparison between s1 and u would be equal, but in Java they are not.\n\nThis is a problem. So in Fortran, the comparison would be true even when the third line has trailing spaces beyond the first token, whereas in Java it's false.\n\nTo solve this, the code must compare the exact input line (including trailing spaces) against the first token from the first line (without any trailing spaces).\n\nTherefore, the approach should be:\n\n- Read the first line's two tokens into s1 and s2 using list-directed input (so s1 is the first token, trimmed of leading/trailing spaces).\n- Read the third line into u as a string, including trailing spaces, but then trim trailing spaces to get the actual input.\n\nWait, but how to trim trailing spaces in Fortran? For example, the function trim removes trailing spaces, but in this case, the input may have trailing spaces that are part of the intended string. So to replicate the Java code's behavior, we need to compare the entire u string (as read, without the newline) to s1 (the first token of the first line, which is read without leading/trailing spaces).\n\nBut in Fortran, after reading u with '(a)', the variable includes the entire line, but padded with spaces. So the actual line's length is from 1 to len_trim(u). For example, if the input line is \"s \", then len_trim(u) is 2. So the actual content is \"s \" (two characters). So to compare u's actual content (up to len_trim(u)) with s1's content (up to len_trim(s1)), but s1 is the first token, which is trimmed.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the solution is:\n\nIn Fortran, after reading s1 and s2, and u:\n\n- Trim s1 to its actual length (remove trailing spaces).\n- Trim u to its actual length (remove trailing spaces).\n- Compare the two trimmed strings.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the comparison is between the entire u (including any trailing spaces) and s1. For example, if u is \"s \", then it's two characters (s and space), and s1 is \"s\" (one character). So in Fortran, after trimming u, it's \"s \", which is not equal to s1's trimmed value of \"s\". Wait, no. The trim function in Fortran removes trailing spaces. So if u is \"s \", then trim(u) is \"s\". Which matches s1's trim(s1) which is \"s\". So this would incorrectly make them equal. But in Java, they are not equal.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the comparison should be between the entire line (u) as read, up to the newline, and s1.\n\nBut how to capture the exact line in u. For example, if the line is \"s \", then u should be \"s \", and compare to s1 (which is \"s\").\n\nBut in Fortran, after reading into a fixed-length variable, the variable contains \"s \" followed by spaces. So the actual data is \"s \" followed by spaces. But when comparing to s1, which is \"s\" followed by spaces, the comparison is true.\n\nThus, the problem remains.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is to read the third line into a variable, and then process it to get the exact string (without the trailing spaces added by Fortran's padding). To do this, we can find the position of the last non-space character in u, then compare the substring up to that position with s1.\n\nBut how to find the last non-space character in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, since in Fortran, when you read a line with '(a)', the variable will have the entire line, including trailing spaces. But to get the exact line, including trailing spaces, you need to know the length of the line. For example, if the line entered is \"s \", then the length is 2, but when stored in a variable of length 100, it's \"s \" followed by 98 spaces. So to compare this to s1, which is \"s\" (length 1), the code must compare the first two characters of u against s1's first two characters.\n\nBut this is not feasible. So perhaps the correct approach is to read the third line into a variable, then trim trailing spaces (so that \"s \" becomes \"s \" with no trailing spaces beyond the input), then compare with s1.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, use the input_line variable for the third line, which can be of varying length. But Fortran 95 does not support allocatable strings, but we can use a large enough buffer.\n\nWait, here's an approach:\n\nRead the third line into a character variable of sufficient length (say 1000), then find the actual length of the input line (excluding trailing spaces added by Fortran). For example:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: u\ninteger :: u_len\nread(*, '(a)') u\nu_len = len_trim(u)  ! This finds the position of the last non-space character in u.\n\nBut if the input line has trailing spaces, then len_trim(u) will include them. Wait, no. The len_trim function returns the length of the string without trailing spaces. For example, if u is \"s   \", len_trim(u) is 1. Because the trailing spaces are considered.\n\nSo len_trim(u) gives the index of the last non-space character in u. So if the input line is \"s \", then u is \"s \" followed by 998 spaces. len_trim(u) is 2, because the first two characters are 's' and ' '.\n\nSo, to get the exact string entered (including trailing spaces), we need to take the substring u(1:u_len).\n\nThen, s1 is read via list-directed input, so it's the first token of the first line, which is stripped of leading and trailing spaces. So s1's len_trim(s1) is the length of the token. So s1_trimmed = s1(1:len_trim(s1)).\n\nThen, the comparison is between the substring u(1:u_len) and s1_trimmed.\n\nWait, but in Java, the comparison is between u (the entire third line, including trailing spaces) and str[0] (the first token of the first line). So if the third line is \"s \", u is \"s \", and str[0] is \"s\", then equals() is false. But in the Fortran code, comparing u(1:u_len) (which is \"s \") to s1_trimmed (which is \"s\") would be \"s \" vs \"s\" \u2192 not equal. So that's correct.\n\nBut how to compare these two substrings in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, you can compare substrings:\n\nif (u(1:u_len) == trim(s1)) then ...\n\nBut trim(s1) would remove trailing spaces from s1, which is already the first token (so no trailing spaces except the padding). So trim(s1) is the same as s1_trimmed.\n\nWait, s1 is read via list-directed input, which reads the first token, so s1 is the token with no leading or trailing spaces, but padded to the length of the variable. So trim(s1) is the same as s1's original token. For example, if s1 is declared as character(len=100), and the token is \"red\", then s1 is \"red\" followed by 97 spaces. trim(s1) would be \"red\".\n\nBut the third line's u is read as a string of length 1000. If the input is \"red \", then u_len is 4 (assuming the input is 'r','e','d',' '), but len_trim(u) is 4 (because trailing spaces are after the fourth character). Wait, no. If the input line is \"red \" (three letters and a space), then u is \"red \" followed by 996 spaces. len_trim(u) returns the index of the last non-space character. In this case, the fourth character is a space, which is a trailing space, so len_trim(u) is 3. Because the first three are 'r','e','d', then space. The len_trim would see the space as trailing and return 3. So the u_len is 3. So u(1:u_len) is 'red'. But in Java, the third line is \"red \", so u is \"red \" (four characters), and equals(str[0]) is false (str[0] is \"red\", three characters).\n\nBut in the Fortran code, after trimming, u is 'red' (three characters), and s1 is 'red', so the comparison would be equal, leading to the wrong result.\n\nThus, this approach would also fail.\n\nSo, the problem is that len_trim(u) considers trailing spaces as part of the trim. But we need to get the exact input line, including trailing spaces, except for the newline.\n\nSo, how to read the third line's exact content, including trailing spaces, in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, when you read a line using '(a)', the variable is filled with the entire line up to the newline, and then padded with spaces to fill the variable's length. For example, if the variable is 10 characters long and the line is \"hello\", then the variable becomes \"hello     \" (5 letters, 5 spaces). So to get the exact line, including trailing spaces, you need to know the length of the line when read. But how?\n\nOne way is to read the line into a buffer of sufficient size, then find the position of the newline character. But in Fortran, when you read a line with '(a)', the newline is not stored. So the buffer contains the line's characters without the newline. The problem is that if the line is shorter than the buffer's length, the rest is filled with spaces.\n\nTherefore, the actual length of the line is the number of characters read before the newline. But Fortran doesn't provide this information directly. So we can read the line into a buffer, then scan for the first newline, but since the newline is not stored, this approach is not possible.\n\nAlternative approach: use a very large buffer, then find the position of the last non-space character. But this is not reliable, because the line may have trailing spaces.\n\nWait, no. If the input line is \"s   \", then the line has three spaces. So the buffer would contain \"s   \" followed by spaces. So the last non-space is at position 4 (s is at 1, then three spaces). len_trim(u) would be 4. Because the first four characters are 's', ' ', ' ', ' ', and the rest are spaces. So len_trim(u) would return 4. So u(1:4) is 's   ', which is the exact input line.\n\nAh, wait no. Let me think:\n\nIf the input line is \"s   \" (three spaces after s), then the line has four characters: 's', ' ', ' ', ' '.\n\nWhen read into a buffer of len 1000 with '(a)', the buffer contains \"s   \" followed by 996 spaces. len_trim(u) will return 4, because the first four characters are non-trailing spaces? Wait, no.\n\nThe len_trim function returns the length of the string without trailing spaces. So if the input line is \"s   \" (four characters), then u is \"s   \" followed by 996 spaces. The trailing spaces in u are the 996. So len_trim(u) is 4, because the first four characters are 's', ' ', ' ', ' ', and the fifth is space (part of the padding). So the last non-space in u is at position 4.\n\nThus, u(1:4) would be the exact input line. So to compare with s1, which is the first token of the first line (without leading/trailing spaces), we need to compare the substring u(1:u_len) with s1's trimmed value.\n\nWait, no. Because in the example, s1 is the first token of the first line. Suppose the first line is \"s t\". Then s1 is \"s\", and the third line is \"s   \". So in Java, u.equals(s1) is false. In Fortran, u_len is 4, so comparing u(1:4) (\"s   \") with s1's trimmed value (\"s\") would require comparing \"s   \" and \"s\", which are not equal.\n\nSo, to compare the two strings exactly as they are in Java, the code must compare the entire third line (as read) with the first token (s1).\n\nThus, the correct approach is:\n\n1. Read the first line into s1 and s2 using list-directed input. This gives s1 as the first token, trimmed of leading/trailing spaces, and s2 as the second token.\n\n2. Read the third line into a buffer and find its actual length (u_len) as the number of characters read, excluding the newline. But since Fortran pads with spaces, we can find u_len as the position of the last non-space character, which is what len_trim does.\n\n3. Compare the substring u(1:u_len) with s1. However, s1 is read using list-directed input, which trims leading/trailing spaces. But s1 is stored as a fixed-length string with trailing spaces. So to compare, we need to trim s1 as well.\n\nWait, but s1 is read as the first token via list-directed input, which trims leading and trailing spaces. So s1's actual value is the first token with no leading or trailing spaces, padded with spaces to fill the variable's length. So trim(s1) would give the first token.\n\nThus, the comparison in Fortran should be:\n\nif (u(1:u_len) == trim(s1)) then ...\n\nBut trim(s1) is the first token. And u(1:u_len) is the exact third line, including any trailing spaces.\n\nFor example:\n\nJava case where third line is \"s \" (two characters):\n\nu_len is 2, u(1:2) is \"s \".\n\ntrim(s1) is \"s\".\n\nIn Fortran, \"s \" == \"s\"? No. So the comparison would be false, which matches Java's equals().\n\nAnother example: third line is \"s\" (one character). u_len is 1, u(1:1) is \"s\". trim(s1) is \"s\". So comparison is true.\n\nThus, this approach works.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read first line's two tokens into s1 and s2.\n\n- Read third line into u, and find u_len = len_trim(u).\n\n- Compare u(1:u_len) with trim(s1). If equal, output a-1 and b. Else, output a and b-1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100) :: s1, s2, u\n    integer :: a, b, u_len\n\n    ! Read first line\n    read(*, *) s1, s2\n\n    ! Read second line (a and b)\n    read(*, *) a, b\n\n    ! Read third line (u)\n    read(*, '(a)') u\n    u_len = len_trim(u)\n\n    ! Compare and output\n    if (u(1:u_len) == trim(s1)) then\n        print '(I0, \" \", I0)', a-1, b\n    else\n        print '(I0, \" \", I0)', a, b-1\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the trim(s1) removes trailing spaces. So s1 is read as the first token, which has no trailing spaces except for the variable's padding. trim(s1) is thus the first token. So the comparison is between the third line's content (as read, including trailing spaces) and the first token (no trailing spaces). This matches the Java code's u.equals(str[0]).\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting:\n\nCase 1:\n\nFirst line input: \"red blue\"\n\ns1 is \"red\", s2 is \"blue\"\n\nThird line input: \"red\"\n\nu is \"red\", u_len is 3. trim(s1) is \"red\". So comparison \"red\" == \"red\" \u2192 true. Output a-1 and b.\n\nCase 2:\n\nFirst line input: \"red blue\"\n\nThird line input: \"red \"\n\nu_len is 4, u(1:4) is \"red \". trim(s1) is \"red\". So comparison \"red \" == \"red\" \u2192 false. Output a and b-1.\n\nWhich matches Java's behavior.\n\nThus, this code should correctly replicate the Java code's functionality."
