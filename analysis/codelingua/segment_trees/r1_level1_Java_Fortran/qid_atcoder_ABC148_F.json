    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nSo the code reads N, u, v. Then it builds a tree structure with edges. Then it calculates the distance from u to all nodes using DFS, and similarly the distance from v to all nodes. Then it finds the maximum e[i] where d[i] < e[i], subtracts 1, and outputs that. \n\nHmm. Fortran doesn't have dynamic lists like Java's ArrayList. So for the edges, in Java, each node has a list of connected nodes. In Fortran, I can use an array of arrays, but since the maximum size is N, perhaps I can preallocate an adjacency list with a fixed size. But Fortran's arrays aren't of objects, so maybe use a 2D array where each row represents the nodes connected to that index, and track the number of connections. Alternatively, use an array of pointers to arrays, but that's more complex. \n\nWait, in the original code, edges is an array of Lists. For each node a and b, the edges are added both ways. So in Fortran, maybe create a 2D array where each row is the list of adjacent nodes. Since each edge is added twice, once for each node. \n\nBut how to manage varying lengths? Maybe use a jagged array, but Fortran doesn't support that directly. Alternatively, use a 2D array with a maximum possible number of edges per node (like N-1), and track the count for each node. So for each node, we have a list of adjacent nodes up to a certain count.\n\nSo for example, edges(1:N, 1:max_degree) where max_degree is N-1. But that's memory inefficient. Alternatively, maybe use an array of derived types that contain dynamic arrays. But I think in Fortran 90 and later, you can have allocatable arrays within derived types. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps represent the adjacency list as two arrays: one that holds all the edges in a contiguous list, and another that holds indices for each node. For example, using a CSR-like structure. But that might complicate things. Since the original code uses a simple list for each node, maybe the easiest way in Fortran is to have a 2D array with a sufficient maximum size, and a separate array to track the number of edges for each node.\n\nSo, let's say edges(n, m), where n is the number of nodes, and m is the maximum possible edges per node. But in the worst case, a node can have N-1 edges. For N up to 1e5, this is impossible. Wait, but in the original Java code, N can be up to whatever the problem allows. But since the problem comes from programming contest, perhaps N is up to 1e5. But in Fortran, a 2D array of size 1e5 x 1e5 is impossible. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nWait, in the original code, the edges are stored as List<Integer>[], which is an array of linked lists. So each node's adjacency list is a dynamic list. In Fortran, perhaps use an array of pointers to arrays, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, use a single 1D array to store all edges, and two index arrays to track the start and end of each node's edges.\n\nAlternatively, use an array of allocatable arrays. Let me check. In Fortran 2003, you can have an array of pointers or allocatable components. So perhaps:\n\ntype :: AdjList\n    integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\nend type AdjList\n\ntype(AdjList), allocatable :: edges(:)\n\nThen for each node i, edges(i)%neighbors is an array of its adjacent nodes.\n\nYes, that could work. Then, when building the edges, for each a and b, we append b to edges(a)%neighbors and a to edges(b)%neighbors.\n\nBut how to dynamically append elements in Fortran? Because in Java, ArrayList.add() appends. In Fortran, you have to reallocate and copy. So for each edge addition, when a node's neighbors array is to be extended, you have to create a new array with size+1, copy the old elements, add the new one. That's going to be inefficient for large N, but for the purposes of translation, perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if the code is for a programming contest with small N, it's manageable. But in the original code, the problem is from ABC148 F, which probably has N up to 1e5. Wait, no, the original code uses a Scanner, which is acceptable for small N. So maybe the problem constraints are manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read N, u, v (but in Fortran, indices start at 1, so need to subtract 1 as in Java? Wait, Java's code uses 0-based indices. So in Fortran, perhaps use 1-based. Wait, in the Java code, u and v are read as input and subtracted by 1. So the original input is 1-based, and the code converts to 0-based. In Fortran, since it's 1-based by default, perhaps read u and v as input, subtract 1, but in Fortran, then use 1-based? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn Java, after reading u and v, subtract 1. So the code uses 0-based nodes. So in Fortran, perhaps the nodes are 0-based as well, but Fortran arrays are 1-based. Hmm. So perhaps in Fortran, the nodes are 0-based, but arrays are 1-based. So when storing the edges, perhaps adjust the indices.\n\nWait, maybe better to keep the code in 1-based indices in Fortran. So when reading u and v from input, subtract 1 (since the input is 1-based) to get 0-based, but then in Fortran, use 1-based, so add 1 to u and v. Wait, perhaps the original code uses 0-based indices for the nodes. So in Fortran, we'll have to manage 1-based.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let's think. For example, in Java:\n\nInput u is given as, say, 3. Then u becomes 2 (0-based). So in Fortran, the nodes are 1-based, so when reading u, we subtract 1, then add 1? Wait, no. Because the input is 1-based. So if in Java, they subtract 1 to convert to 0-based. So in Fortran, if the code uses 1-based, then the input u and v are 1-based, so we subtract 1 to get 0-based? Wait, no. Wait, the original problem's input is 1-based. For example, the nodes are numbered from 1 to N. So when the Java code subtracts 1, it's converting to 0-based. So in Fortran, we need to read the input as 1-based, and convert to 1-based? No. Wait, no. Let's think: the Java code reads u and v as 1-based in the input, then subtracts 1 to make them 0-based. So in Fortran, if we want to use 1-based indices, we can read u and v as input, and leave them as they are, but subtract 1 to get 0-based. But then in the code, the nodes are 0-based. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn the Java code, after reading u and v, they are subtracted by 1. So the code uses 0-based indices. So in Fortran, perhaps the code should use 0-based indices. But Fortran's arrays are 1-based by default. So perhaps we can adjust the code to use 1-based. So in Fortran, when reading u and v, subtract 1 to get the Java's 0-based, then add 1 to make them 1-based in Fortran. For example:\n\nOriginal input u is 3 (Java code converts to 2 (0-based)). In Fortran, we read 3, subtract 1 to get 2, then add 1 to get 3 (so 1-based in Fortran). Wait, but then the code's u and v are 1-based. Then all the edges are built with 1-based indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe keep everything 0-based in Fortran, but Fortran arrays start at 1. So for example, d is dimension(0:N-1) in Fortran. But that's possible. Let's see:\n\nIn Fortran, when you declare an array with 'integer :: d(0:N-1)', then you can index from 0 to N-1. So the code can use 0-based indices for the nodes. That might be easier for translation.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Declare all arrays with 0-based indices where necessary.\n\nFor example, in Java:\n\nedges is an array of size N (0-based). In Fortran, edges can be an array of N elements, each being a dynamic array. So in Fortran:\n\ntype(AdjList), allocatable :: edges(:)\nallocate(edges(0:N-1))  ! 0-based.\n\nThen, for each edge a and b (0-based in Java), in Fortran, also 0-based. So when reading a and b from input, subtract 1 (since input is 1-based) to get 0-based. Then add them to edges(a) and edges(b).\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would:\n\nRead N, u, v from input. Subtract 1 from u and v to convert to 0-based.\n\nThen, for each of N-1 edges, read a and b, subtract 1 to get 0-based, and add them to edges(a) and edges(b).\n\nThen, perform DFS from u and v, calculating the distances d and e.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n1. Read N, u, v. Subtract 1 from u and v.\n\n2. Read N-1 edges, each a and b (subtract 1 from each), and build the adjacency list.\n\n3. Initialize d array with MAX_VALUE (or a large number), set d[u] = 0, then DFS from u.\n\n4. Initialize e array similarly, set e[v] = 0, DFS from v.\n\n5. Iterate through all nodes, find the maximum e[i] where d[i] < e[i], then subtract 1 and output.\n\nNow, the main challenge is representing the adjacency list and performing the DFS.\n\nIn Fortran, to represent the adjacency list, we can use a derived type with an allocatable array for each node's neighbors.\n\nSo:\n\nmodule adj_list_module\n    type adj_list\n        integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\n    end type adj_list\nend module adj_list_module\n\nThen, edges is an array of adj_list objects.\n\nBut appending to the neighbors array is a bit involved. Each time we add a neighbor, we need to reallocate and copy. For example:\n\nsubroutine add_neighbor(list, node)\n    type(adj_list), intent(inout) :: list\n    integer, intent(in) :: node\n    integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n    if (.not. allocated(list%neighbors)) then\n        allocate(list%neighbors(1))\n        list%neighbors(1) = node\n    else\n        call move_alloc(list%neighbors, temp)\n        allocate(list%neighbors(size(temp) + 1))\n        list%neighbors(1:size(temp)) = temp\n        list%neighbors(size(temp)+1) = node\n    endif\nend subroutine add_neighbor\n\nBut this is inefficient for large N. However, given that the original code uses a programming contest problem, perhaps N is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, each edge is processed twice (for a and b). So for each edge a, b, add b to a's list and a to b's list.\n\nSo for each of N-1 edges, we process two nodes. So total of 2*(N-1) additions.\n\nEach addition for a node's list requires reallocating and copying. For a node with degree k, this would take O(k^2) time. But perhaps for programming contest purposes, N is small enough that this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, precompute the degrees first. But that would require reading the input twice. Maybe not feasible here.\n\nSo proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, the DFS function. The Java code's dfs function takes the current node u, the distance array d, and edges. For each neighbor nu of u, if d[nu] is MAX_VALUE, set d[nu] = d[u] + 1 and recurse.\n\nIn Fortran, the DFS function will need to modify the distance array, which is passed as an argument. Since in Fortran, arrays are passed by reference, this is manageable.\n\nBut the edges are part of a derived type array. So the DFS function will need access to that.\n\nSo the DFS subroutine could look like:\n\nrecursive subroutine dfs(u, d, edges)\n    integer, intent(in) :: u\n    integer, intent(inout) :: d(0:)\n    type(adj_list), intent(in) :: edges(0:)\n    integer :: i, nu\n\n    do i = 1, size(edges(u)%neighbors)\n        nu = edges(u)%neighbors(i)\n        if (d(nu) == huge(0)) then\n            d(nu) = d(u) + 1\n            call dfs(nu, d, edges)\n        endif\n    end do\nend subroutine dfs\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the edges array is 0-based. So edges(u) is the adjacency list for node u. Then, edges(u)%neighbors is an array of neighboring nodes. So for each neighbor in that array, we process.\n\nBut in the code above, the loop is from 1 to size(edges(u)%neighbors), but if the array is allocated starting at 1. Wait, no. In Fortran, the default lower bound of an allocated array is 1. So when we create list%neighbors, it's allocated as (1:n), so the indices start at 1. So the loop would be from 1 to size(neighbors).\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the code, for each neighbor in the list, we check if its distance is still MAX. If so, update and recurse.\n\nBut in Fortran, the size of the neighbors array can be obtained with size(edges(u)%neighbors). So that's manageable.\n\nNow, the initial setup.\n\nFirst, read N, u, v.\n\nIn Fortran, we read using read(*,*) N, u, v. Then subtract 1 from u and v to make them 0-based.\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, u and v are read and converted to 0-based. So in Fortran, after reading, we do u = u -1, v = v -1.\n\nThen, allocate edges(0:N-1) as type(adj_list).\n\nThen, for each of N-1 edges:\n\nread a and b, subtract 1 from each, and add each to the other's adjacency list.\n\nSo:\n\ndo i = 1, N-1\n    read(*,*) a, b\n    a = a -1\n    b = b -1\n    call add_neighbor(edges(a), b)\n    call add_neighbor(edges(b), a)\nend do\n\nBut the add_neighbor subroutine takes a list (type adj_list) and a node. So in the code, edges(a) is an adj_list element. So the call is:\n\ncall add_neighbor(edges(a), b)\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't pass an element of an array of derived types by intent(inout) unless it's a pointer. Wait, no. If edges is an array of adj_list, then edges(a) is an adj_list. So when you pass edges(a) to a subroutine that takes an adj_list with intent(inout), it should work. Because in Fortran, the array elements are passed by reference. So the add_neighbor subroutine can modify the edges(a) element.\n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nsubroutine add_neighbor(list, node)\n    type(adj_list), intent(inout) :: list\n    integer, intent(in) :: node\n    ...\nend subroutine\n\nThen, when we call call add_neighbor(edges(a), b), the list is edges(a), and the subroutine can modify it. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo after building the adjacency lists, initialize d array.\n\nIn Java, d is initialized to Integer.MAX_VALUE, which is 2^31-1. In Fortran, we can use huge(0), which is the largest integer. So:\n\ninteger, parameter :: INF = huge(0)\n\nThen, allocate d(0:N-1) and set to INF.\n\nBut in Fortran, the array can be declared as:\n\ninteger :: d(0:N-1)\n\nBut in Fortran 90, you can't have automatic arrays unless they are in a subroutine. So perhaps the code will need to allocate them dynamically.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: d(:)\nallocate(d(0:N-1))\nd = INF\nd(u) = 0\ncall dfs(u, d, edges)\n\nBut how to handle the edges array in the subroutine. Because edges is an array of adj_list, which is a derived type. So the subroutine dfs must have the edges array as an argument.\n\nThe same for the e array.\n\nThen, after calculating d and e arrays, iterate over all nodes to find the maximum e(i) where d(i) < e(i).\n\nThe maximum q starts as -1, then for each i, if d(i) < e(i), then q is the maximum between q and e(i). Then, the answer is q-1 if q>0, else 0.\n\nWait, but in the original code:\n\nint q = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    if (d[i] < e[i]) {\n        if (e[i] > q) {\n            q = e[i];\n        }\n    }\n}\nif (q <= 0) {\n    System.out.println(0);\n} else {\n    System.out.println(q - 1);\n}\n\nSo q is the maximum e[i] where d[i] < e[i]. Then, if q is <=0, output 0 else q-1.\n\nBut since e[i] is the distance from v to i. So when is e[i] 0? Only for i = v. But d[v] is the distance from u to v. If u and v are the same, then d[v] =0, e[v]=0. Then, in the loop, d[v] < e[v] is 0 <0 which is false. So q remains -1, and output 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing d and e, loop from i=0 to N-1:\n\nmax_q = -1\ndo i = 0, N-1\n    if (d(i) < e(i)) then\n        if (e(i) > max_q) then\n            max_q = e(i)\n        endif\n    endif\nend do\n\nif (max_q <=0) then\n    print *, 0\nelse\n    print *, max_q -1\nendif\n\nNow, the problem is handling the case where max_q is still -1. But according to the code, that's possible if no node satisfies d[i] < e[i]. Then output 0.\n\nBut why would that happen? Because in the problem, u and v are two distinct nodes. If u is the same as v, then all nodes would have d[i] = e[i], so max_q remains -1. So output 0.\n\nBut how? For example, if u and v are the same node. But according to the problem statement, perhaps u and v are different. The code allows them to be the same.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code structure in Fortran would be:\n\n- Modules for the adj_list type and subroutines.\n\nBut in Fortran, recursive subroutines must be explicitly declared as such.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nprogram main\n    use adj_list_module\n    implicit none\n    type(adj_list), allocatable :: edges(:)\n    integer :: N, u, v, i, a, b, max_q\n    integer, allocatable :: d(:), e(:)\n    integer, parameter :: INF = huge(0)\n\n    read(*,*) N, u, v\n    u = u -1  ! Convert to 0-based\n    v = v -1\n\n    allocate(edges(0:N-1))\n\n    do i = 1, N-1\n        read(*,*) a, b\n        a = a -1\n        b = b -1\n        call add_neighbor(edges(a), b)\n        call add_neighbor(edges(b), a)\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute d\n    allocate(d(0:N-1))\n    d = INF\n    d(u) = 0\n    call dfs(u, d, edges)\n\n    ! Compute e\n    allocate(e(0:N-1))\n    e = INF\n    e(v) = 0\n    call dfs(v, e, edges)\n\n    !

So perhaps:\n\nmodule adj_list_mod\n    type adj_list\n        integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\n    end type adj_list\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine add_neighbor(list, node)\n        type(adj_list), intent(inout) :: list\n        integer, intent(in) :: node\n        integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n        if (.not. allocated(list%neighbors)) then\n            allocate(list%neighbors(1))\n            list%neighbors(1) = node\n        else\n            call move_alloc(list%neighbors, temp)\n            allocate(list%neighbors(size(temp) + 1))\n            list%neighbors(1:size(temp)) = temp\n            list%neighbors(size(temp)+1) = node\n        end if\n    end subroutine add_neighbor\n\nend module adj_list_mod\n\nThen, the main program uses this module.\n\nBut the main program is in a separate program block. So the code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    use adj_list_mod\n    implicit none\n    type(adj_list), allocatable :: edges(:)\n    integer :: N, u, v, i, a, b, max_q\n    integer, allocatable :: d(:), e(:)\n    integer, parameter :: INF = huge(0)\n\n    read(*,*) N, u, v\n    u = u -1  !

Also, the d array is declared as d(0:), which starts at 0.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you pass an array section, the lower bound is maintained. So when d is allocated as (0:N-1), passing d to the subroutine with d(0:) is correct.\n\nNow, potential issues:\n\n1. The add_neighbor subroutine uses move_alloc to expand the neighbors array. This should work, but in Fortran, move_alloc is Fortran 2003. So the code may need to be compiled with a Fortran 2003 compatible compiler.\n\n2. The initial allocation of edges. When edges is allocated as edges(0:N-1), each element is of type adj_list. Each element's neighbors array is initially unallocated. The add_neighbor subroutine handles the initial allocation.\n\n3. The DFS is recursive. Fortran allows recursive subroutines when they are declared with the 'recursive' keyword, which this code does.\n\n4. The main program contains the dfs subroutine in the contains section, so it has access to the variables in the main program. Wait, no. The dfs subroutine is part of the main program's scope, so it can access variables like edges, but in this code, edges is passed as an argument. So it's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the loop over the edges, after reading a and b, subtract 1 to make them 0-based, then add to the adjacency list. So the edges are stored as 0-based.\n\nIn the DFS, when processing edges(u)%neighbors(i), which is 0-based node.\n\nNow, testing with small input.\n\nFor example, sample input where N=3, u=1, v=3, edges 1-2, 2-3.\n\nJava code after subtracting 1: u=0, v=2. Edges: 0-1 and 1-2.\n\nIn Fortran, edges(0) has neighbors 1. edges(1) has 0 and 2. edges(2) has 1.\n\nThen, d is distance from 0. d[0]=0, d[1]=1, d[2]=2.\n\ne is distance from 2. e[2]=0, e[1]=1, e[0]=2.\n\nLooking for nodes where d[i] < e[i]. For i=0: 0 <2 \u2192 yes, e[i]=2. i=1:1 <1 \u2192 no. i=2:2 <0 \u2192 no. So max_q is 2. Output 2-1=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code's output would be 1. The original code outputs q-1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, edge cases. For example, when u and v are the same. Then, d and e arrays are the same. So no nodes satisfy d[i] < e[i]. So max_q is -1, output 0.\n\nAnother case where u and v are adjacent. Then, the distance between them is 1. So in their respective distance arrays, etc.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, translating the code into Fortran with the considerations above.\n\nPotential adjustments:\n\n- The INF can be huge(0), which is 2147483647 in many compilers.\n\n- The use of dynamic arrays in the adj_list.\n\n- The recursive DFS.\n\nSo the final code is as written above."
