    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's look at the Java code first. The program reads N and T, then reads N pairs of integers into AB. Then it sorts AB based on the first element of each pair. Then there's a dynamic programming part with a 2D array dp, and finally it outputs the maximum value in the last row of dp.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses static arrays, so I'll need to declare them with appropriate dimensions. The Java code uses a 2D array AB with N rows and 2 columns. In Fortran, that would be a 2D array dimensioned as AB(N, 2). Similarly, the dp array is (N+1) x 6001. So in Fortran, that's dp(N+1, 6001).\n\nNext, the input part. In Java, they use a Scanner to read N and T. Then loop N times to read each pair into AB. In Fortran, we can use READ statements. So something like:\n\nREAD(*,*) N, T\nDO i = 1, N\n    READ(*,*) AB(i, 1), AB(i, 2)\nEND DO\n\nBut wait, in Java, the array AB is zero-based, but in Fortran, the default is one-based. So when we sort AB in Java, the code uses AB[i-1][0] in the loop for i from 1 to N. So in Fortran, the indices would start from 1. So the sorting should be done based on the first element of each row. How to sort a 2D array in Fortran based on a column? Hmm.\n\nJava's Arrays.sort uses a comparator that compares the first element of each sub-array. So in Fortran, we need to sort the AB array in ascending order according to the first column. Fortran doesn't have built-in sorting for 2D arrays, so we need to implement a custom sort. Maybe using a simple bubble sort or another O(n^2) algorithm since N isn't specified here, but the original code is for programming competition, so N could be up to maybe 3000 or similar. Wait, the DP array has 6001 elements for time, so maybe N is up to 3000. Hmm, but bubble sort would be O(n^2) which might be acceptable if N is small. Alternatively, use a more efficient sorting method. But for the sake of code translation, perhaps a simple approach is better.\n\nSo, create an array of indices, sort them based on the first element of AB, then reorder AB accordingly. Or perhaps sort the AB array in-place using insertion sort. Let's think. Let's implement a custom sort for the AB array. For example, for each i from 1 to N-1, find the minimum index in the remaining elements where AB(j,1) is the smallest, and swap the rows. That's selection sort. Alternatively, for code brevity, use a custom comparator and sort the array. But Fortran doesn't have a built-in way to do this, so we have to implement it.\n\nSo here's the plan: sort the AB array in Fortran by the first column in ascending order. So loop through each element and compare, swapping rows when necessary.\n\nOnce the AB array is sorted, the DP part. The Java code initializes a 2D dp array. The loops are for i from 1 to N, and timeAfterEat from 0 to 6000. Then for each, dp[i][timeAfterEat] is set to the max of itself or dp[i-1][timeAfterEat]. Then, if timeAfterEat - time is between 0 and T-1 (since timeAfterEat - time < T), then dp[i][timeAfterEat] is the max of current value and dp[i-1][timeAfterEat - time] + value.\n\nIn Fortran, the indices start at 1. So the loops would be i from 1 to N, and timeAfterEat from 0 to 6000. But in Fortran, arrays can start at 1, but here, timeAfterEat starts at 0, so perhaps we should declare the dp array with 0-based index for the second dimension. Wait, Fortran allows arbitrary lower bounds if specified. So maybe declare dp(0:N, 0:6000), but maybe the original code uses 1-based in Java for i, but in Java, it's 0-based. Wait, the Java code's dp is [N+1][6001], which is from 0 to N and 0 to 6000. So in Fortran, to have the same indices, we can have dp(0:N, 0:6000). So in Fortran, the declaration would be:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: dp(:, :)\nallocate(dp(0:N, 0:6000))\n\nBut since N and T are read from input, we need to allocate after reading N and T. Wait, but in Fortran, you can't have an allocatable array with dimensions depending on variables unless you use the allocate statement. So first read N and T, then allocate AB and dp.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead N, T\n\nAllocate AB(1:N, 1:2)\n\nRead AB's elements.\n\nSort AB based on the first column in ascending order.\n\nAllocate dp(0:N, 0:6000), initializing to zero. But in Fortran, when you allocate an array, it's not initialized. So we have to set dp to zero. So perhaps initialize it with dp = 0.\n\nThen loop i from 1 to N:\n\n   loop timeAfterEat from 0 to 6000:\n\n      dp(i, timeAfterEat) = max(dp(i, timeAfterEat), dp(i-1, timeAfterEat))\n\n      time = AB(i, 1) ? Wait, in Java, i runs from 1 to N, and AB[i-1] is accessed. Because in Java, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, since we sorted AB in 1-based index, when i is 1 in Java, it's i=1 in Fortran, so AB(i-1) becomes AB(0) in Java but in Fortran, i starts at 1, so AB(i) is the ith element. Wait, no. Let's re-examine.\n\nJava code:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n\n   int time = AB[i-1][0];\n\n   int value = AB[i-1][1];\n\n}\n\nSo when i is 1, AB[0] is accessed. So in Fortran, if the AB array is 1-based, then for i in 1..N, the current AB element is AB(i, 1) and AB(i, 2).\n\nSo in the Fortran code, when i is from 1 to N (since the loop is i=1 to N in Java), then in Fortran, the same loop would be i from 1 to N. So time = AB(i, 1), value = AB(i, 2). So the code for Fortran would have:\n\ntime = AB(i, 1)\n\nvalue = AB(i, 2)\n\nThen, check if 0 <= timeAfterEat - time and timeAfterEat - time < T. So timeAfterEat - time >=0 and < T.\n\nIf so, then:\n\ndp(i, timeAfterEat) = max(dp(i, timeAfterEat), dp(i-1, timeAfterEat - time) + value)\n\nIn Fortran, the max function can take two arguments. So in each step, we set the current dp(i, timeAfterEat) to the maximum of itself or the previous value plus value.\n\nThen, after filling the dp array, the result is the maximum of the last row (dp[N][...] in Java). In Fortran, the last row is dp(N, :), but since in Fortran, the loop is up to N, but the dp array is 0:N. Wait, in Java, the dp array is of size N+1, so indices 0 to N. So in Fortran, the dp array is declared as (0:N, 0:6000). So for i=1 to N, the loop in Fortran would be from i=1 to N, and the previous row is i-1 (0-based in the first dimension? Wait, no. Wait, in Fortran, if the first dimension is 0:N, then for i in Java from 1 to N, the Fortran code would have i in 1 to N. So dp(i, ...) refers to the i-th row (Java's dp[i][...]), and dp(i-1, ...) is Java's dp[i-1][...].\n\nSo the code for the loops should be correct.\n\nNow, the main steps are:\n\n1. Read N and T.\n\n2. Read AB array.\n\n3. Sort AB by first column ascending.\n\n4. Initialize dp array.\n\n5. Fill dp array.\n\n6. Find maximum in dp(N, 0:6000).\n\nNow, the sorting part is the trickiest. How to sort AB in Fortran by the first column.\n\nLet me think. Let's implement a simple selection sort. For each i from 1 to N-1, find the minimum element in the first column from i to N, then swap the entire row with the current i.\n\nSo code for sorting:\n\ndo i = 1, N-1\n\n    min_idx = i\n\n    do j = i+1, N\n\n        if (AB(j,1) < AB(min_idx,1)) then\n\n            min_idx = j\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! swap rows i and min_idx\n\n    if (min_idx /= i) then\n\n        temp1 = AB(i,1)\n\n        temp2 = AB(i,2)\n\n        AB(i,1) = AB(min_idx,1)\n\n        AB(i,2) = AB(min_idx,2)\n\n        AB(min_idx,1) = temp1\n\n        AB(min_idx,2) = temp2\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThat's a selection sort. It's O(n\u00b2) but for code translation purposes, perhaps acceptable.\n\nNow, the DP initialization. The dp array is initialized to zero. In Fortran, when we allocate it, we need to set all elements to zero. So after allocation, set dp = 0.\n\nThe loops:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n    do timeAfterEat = 0, 6000\n\n        ! Update dp(i, timeAfterEat) with dp(i-1, timeAfterEat)\n\n        dp(i, timeAfterEat) = max(dp(i, timeAfterEat), dp(i-1, timeAfterEat))\n\n        time = AB(i,1)\n\n        value = AB(i,2)\n\n        if ( (timeAfterEat - time) >= 0 .and. (timeAfterEat - time) < T ) then\n\n            if (dp(i-1, timeAfterEat - time) + value > dp(i, timeAfterEat)) then\n\n                dp(i, timeAfterEat) = dp(i-1, timeAfterEat - time) + value\n\n            end if\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, in Java code, the condition is:\n\nif (0 <= timeAfterEat - time && timeAfterEat - time < T)\n\nWhich translates to timeAfterEat - time >=0 and timeAfterEat - time < T.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif ( (timeAfterEat - time) >=0 .and. (timeAfterEat - time) < T ) then\n\nSo the code inside the loop is correct.\n\nFinally, after filling dp, find the maximum value in the last row (i=N). So in Fortran, this is the maximum of dp(N, 0:6000). How to compute that?\n\nWe can loop through all elements from 0 to 6000 and find the maximum.\n\nmax_val = 0\n\ndo timeAfterEat = 0, 6000\n\n    if (dp(N, timeAfterEat) > max_val) then\n\n        max_val = dp(N, timeAfterEat)\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nprint *, max_val\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, some considerations:\n\n- The original Java code uses a DP array of size N+1 by 6001. So in Fortran, the dimensions are (0:N, 0:6000). So when allocating, the code would be:\n\nallocate(dp(0:N, 0:6000))\n\nBut in Fortran, the first index is 0 to N, which is N+1 elements, and second index 0 to 6000 (6001 elements).\n\nYes.\n\nAnother point: the Java code initializes the dp array to zero. So in Fortran, after allocation, we need to set all elements to zero. So:\n\ndp = 0\n\nBut in Fortran, this is allowed if the array is allocatable and has been allocated.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead N and T.\n\nAllocate AB(1:N, 1:2) (assuming AB starts at 1 for the first index), but wait, in Fortran, the default is to start at 1 if you don't specify the bounds. Wait, no. When you allocate AB(N, 2), the indices are from 1 to N and 1 to 2. So when you read the input, you loop i from 1 to N and read AB(i,1) and AB(i,2). Then during the sort, we swap the rows (i and min_idx) which are 1-based.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nPutting all together, the Fortran code would look like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, T, i, j, min_idx, temp1, temp2, timeAfterEat, time, value, max_val\n    integer, allocatable :: AB(:,:), dp(:,:)\n    \n    read(*,*) N, T\n    allocate(AB(N, 2))\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*,*) AB(i, 1), AB(i, 2)\n    end do\n    \n    !

So in the code, when accessing AB(i,1), that's correct.\n\nBut the selection sort loop runs from i=1 to N-1, and j from i+1 to N. That's okay.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the timeAfterEat loop is up to 6000, which is 0 to 6000 inclusive. In Fortran, the loop is timeAfterEat = 0, 6000, which covers the same range.\n\nAlso, in the DP step, when timeAfterEat - time is computed, for example, if timeAfterEat is 0 and time is 5, then timeAfterEat - time is -5, which is invalid. But the condition checks if it's >=0 and < T, so it's skipped.\n\nTesting the code with some sample input would help, but given the time constraints, this should be the correct translation."
