    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's look at what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, it's reading a line of input using BufferedReader. Then, it replaces all commas in that line with spaces and appends the result to a StringBuilder. Finally, it prints the modified string.\n\nSo the main steps are: read a string, replace commas with spaces, and output.\n\nIn Fortran, I know that reading input can be done with READ(*,*) or READ(*,'(A)') for a whole line. Wait, but Fortran has some differences in string handling. Let's think.\n\nJava's readLine() reads the entire line. So in Fortran, using a character variable of sufficient length. Maybe declare a character variable, say, line, with a large enough size, like 256 characters. Then read the line with format '(A)'.\n\nThen, replace all commas in the line with spaces. How to do that in Fortran? Well, Fortran doesn't have a built-in replace function, so I need to loop through each character and replace commas manually.\n\nSo, loop from 1 to the length of the string (using LEN_TRIM to find the actual length?), check each character. If it's a comma, replace it with a space.\n\nOnce the string is modified, print it.\n\nWait, but in Java, the original string 'a' is read, then replaced and stored in the StringBuilder. So in Fortran, after modifying the line variable, we can just print it.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nDeclare a character variable, say, line*256. Read the line with READ(*, '(A)') line. Then loop through each character in line, replacing commas. Then print the modified line.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Declare a character variable of sufficient length.\n2. Read the input line.\n3. Iterate over each character in the line.\n4. Replace each ',' with ' '.\n5. Print the modified line.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nSample code structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=256) :: line\n    integer :: i\n\n    read(*, '(A)') line  ! Read the entire line\n\n    ! Replace commas with spaces\n    do i = 1, len_trim(line)\n        if (line(i:i) == ',') then\n            line(i:i) = ' '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print '(a)', trim(line)\nend program main\n\nWait, but len_trim gives the length without trailing spaces. So looping up to len_trim(line) might miss commas that are after the trimmed part. Wait, no, because the input line may not have trailing spaces. For example, if the user enters \"abc,def\", the line variable would contain \"abc,def\" followed by spaces to fill up 256 characters. But len_trim(line) would return 7 in this case, so the loop would check up to index 7. The remaining characters (from 8 to 256) are spaces, so no commas there. So using len_trim is correct here.\n\nAlternatively, if the line is longer than 256 characters, the read would only take the first 256. But the original Java code reads the entire line, so maybe in Fortran, we should set a larger length. But for the problem's purposes, 256 may suffice, assuming the input isn't longer.\n\nThus, the code above should work. Let me check.\n\nTesting with input \"a,b,c\". The Java code replaces commas with spaces, outputting \"a b c\". The Fortran code would do the same.\n\nYes. So that's the translation."
