    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the code first. The Java code reads an integer n, then calculates a sum using a loop from 1 to n. For each i, it adds i multiplied by (n/i) multiplied by ((n/i)+1) divided by 2. Then it prints the result.\n\nFirst, let's think about the Fortran structure. The main program will handle input and output. Fortran uses integer division, but I need to make sure that divisions are done correctly. In Java, when dividing integers with /, it automatically truncates. Fortran does the same with integer division, so (n/i) should be the same.\n\nThe loop in Java is from i=1 to n inclusive. So in Fortran, the loop will be do i=1, n.\n\nThe variable ans is a long in Java, which is 64-bit. Fortran uses integer kinds for that. So perhaps I should declare ans as integer(kind=8) to handle large numbers, since the sum could be big.\n\nInput in Fortran can be read using read(*,*) n. Then initialize ans to 0.\n\nThe formula in Java: ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n\nIn Fortran, the order of operations matters. Let's break it down. For each term:\n\nterm = i * (n / i) * ( (n / i) + 1 ) / 2\n\nBut in Fortran, integer division truncates towards zero, same as Java. So (n/i) is the same. However, the multiplication order may affect things. Since all variables here are integers, we need to make sure that the multiplications don't cause overflow. But in the Java code, they are cast to long, which handles larger numbers. So in Fortran, using 8-byte integers (integer(kind=8)) for ans and possibly for the intermediate terms is necessary.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the variables i, n, and the divisions would be 4-byte integers by default if declared as integer. So maybe I should declare all variables as integer(kind=8) to prevent overflow.\n\nWait, for example, if n is up to 1e12, then (n/i) could be up to 1e12, then multiplied by (n/i)+1, which is 1e12+1. So (n/i)*(n/i+1) would be up to around 1e24. Then multiplied by i, which could be up to 1e12. So the total could be up to 1e36. Wait, but that's way larger than even 64-bit integers can hold. Oh wait, but in Java, it's using long, which is 64 bits. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Because 1e36 is way beyond 64-bit integer's capacity (which is ~9e18). So perhaps the original Java code may overflow for large n. But assuming that the problem constraints are within the allowed range, and the code is correct as given.\n\nBut when translating to Fortran, we need to handle large integers. So using 64-bit integers (integer(8)) for ans and the temporary variables.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, ans is a long, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, ans should be integer(8) as well.\n\nSo, variables n, i should be integer(8) as well to prevent overflow during calculations.\n\nWait, let's think. For example, n is read as an integer. If n is up to 1e12, then in Java, it's stored as int, but wait, no. Wait, in the Java code, n is read as an int. Wait, but if n is up to 1e12, then that's beyond the maximum int value (which is 2^31-1 \u2248 2e9). So perhaps the Java code is incorrect for large n. But the original code uses nextInt(), which reads an integer. So maybe the problem's constraints are such that n is within the int range. But that's not our problem here. The code is given as is, so we translate it as per the code.\n\nWait, but in Java, if n is read as an int and then cast to long, but if n is beyond 2^31-1, nextInt() would fail. So perhaps the original code is intended for n being up to 1e9 or something. But the code may have a bug here. However, the user wants a translation, so we proceed.\n\nIn Fortran, to handle large n, perhaps we need to read n as integer(8). So all variables should be integer(8).\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Declare variables n, i as integer(8).\n\n2. ans as integer(8) initialized to 0.\n\n3. Read n from input.\n\n4. Loop i from 1 to n.\n\n5. For each i, compute the term and add to ans.\n\nThe term is i * (n/i) * ((n/i)+1) / 2.\n\nBut in Fortran, the operator precedence is same as Java, so the order is correct.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nIn Java, the calculation is ((n/i) * (n/i +1)) /2. Then multiplied by i.\n\nBut according to operator precedence, the multiplication and division are left associative. So:\n\ni * (n/i) * ( (n/i)+1 ) / 2\n\nSo order is:\n\nMultiply i by (n/i), then multiply by (n/i +1), then divide by 2.\n\nIn Fortran, the same.\n\nBut we need to be careful about integer division. For example, when we divide by 2, if the product is even, it's okay. Otherwise, since in Java, integer division truncates, same as Fortran.\n\nBut let's see: the product (n/i) * (n/i +1) is two consecutive integers multiplied. So one of them is even, so the product is even. Thus dividing by 2 would be exact. So no loss in integer division.\n\nTherefore, the term can be computed as i * ( (n/i) * ( (n/i) + 1 ) ) / 2.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nterm = i * ( (n / i) * ( (n / i) + 1 ) ) / 2\n\nThen ans = ans + term.\n\nSo the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer(8) :: n, i, ans, tmp\n  read(*,*) n\n  ans = 0\n  do i = 1, n\n    tmp = n / i\n    ans = ans + i * tmp * (tmp + 1) / 2\n  end do\n  print*, ans\nend program main\n\nWait, but why use a tmp variable? Well, in the original code, (n/i) is computed twice. So to avoid computing it twice, perhaps using a temporary variable. That's more efficient and cleaner.\n\nAlternatively, compute it inline. But using tmp is better for clarity.\n\nWait, but in Java, the code computes (n/i) once and uses it twice. So in Fortran, using tmp = n/i is equivalent.\n\nSo yes, the code above should work.\n\nNow, checking data types. All variables (n, i, tmp, ans) are integer(8). That should handle large numbers.\n\nTesting with sample input. For example, if n=4:\n\nJava code computes:\n\ni=1: 1 * (4/1) * (4/1+1)/2 = 1*4*5/2= 10. sum +=10 \u2192 10.\n\ni=2: 2*(2)*(3)/2= 2*2*3/2=6 \u2192 sum 16.\n\ni=3:3*(1)*(2)/2=3*2/2=3 \u2192 sum 19.\n\ni=4:4*(1)*(2)/2=4*2/2=4 \u2192 sum 23.\n\nTotal is 23. Let's see what the Fortran code gives.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
