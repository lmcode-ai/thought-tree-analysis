So perhaps the Fortran code should use double precision to match the precision. In Java, the code does:\n\nans2 = CC.subtract(DD);\ndans2 = ans2.doubleValue();\ndouble ans = Math.sqrt(dans2); So the final result is a double. So in Fortran, using double precision (real*8) variables should be sufficient. So perhaps better to use double precision variables. So revise variables:\n\nreal*8 :: a, b, h, m\nreal*8 :: minute_angle, hour_angle, angle_diff, radians, distance\n\nWait, but h and m are integers. But in the code, they are read as integers.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to convert this Java code to Fortran. Hmm. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing.\n\nThe program calculates the distance between the two ends of clock hands. Oh right, the time is given as H and M, so the hour and minute hands. The formula probably uses the law of cosines with the angle between them.\n\nSo the steps are: calculate the angle of each hand, find the difference, compute the cosine part, then the distance.\n\nIn Java, they use BigDecimal for precise calculations. But Fortran doesn't have BigDecimal. Wait, but looking closer, the code converts everything to doubles eventually. Because the final answer is a double. So maybe in Fortran, using real variables is okay.\n\nLet me go through each part.\n\nFirst, the input: A, B, H, M. So in Fortran, I'll need to read these as integers. Then convert them to real numbers for calculations.\n\nThen, the angle calculations:\n\nmkaku is MM * 6 degrees (since the minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute). But in Java, MM is the input M, right? Because M is the minutes. So mkaku is M * 6. Then hkaku is H*30 (30 degrees per hour) plus M/2 degrees (since the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute). So the hour angle is H*30 + M*0.5.\n\nThe angle between them is the absolute difference between mkaku and hkaku. Then convert that angle to radians for the cosine calculation.\n\nThen the law of cosines: c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos(theta). So the distance is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos(theta)).\n\nIn the Java code, they use BigDecimal for the calculations up until the cosine, but then convert to double for the Math.cos and sqrt. So maybe in Fortran, using real variables is sufficient. Especially since the BigDecimal part might have been overkill, or perhaps the original problem required high precision, but maybe the Fortran version can just use double precision reals.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read A, B, H, M as integers.\n\n2. Compute the angles of hour and minute hands.\n\n3. Find the absolute difference between the two angles, then take the minimal angle (since angles on a circle can be the smaller or larger one, but cos(theta) is same as cos(360-theta), but maybe the code in Java just takes the absolute difference as is).\n\n4. Compute the cosine of the angle in radians.\n\n5. Apply the law of cosines to find the distance.\n\nSo let's translate each part.\n\nJava's variables:\n\nA and B are the lengths of the hands. H is hour, M is minutes.\n\nIn Fortran, variables can be declared as real or integer.\n\nSo first, read the integers. Let's use integer for H and M, and real for A, B.\n\nWait, but in Java, A and B are integers. Oh, but in the code, they are converted to BigDecimal. But in Fortran, perhaps we can read them as real (since the code uses them in calculations that might involve decimals).\n\nWait, no. The problem probably expects A and B to be integers. But in the code, they are treated as real numbers for the math. So in Fortran, perhaps read them as real (maybe the input is integer values, but stored as real variables). Alternatively, read them as integers and convert to real.\n\nBut in Fortran, if you read integers into real variables, it's okay. So maybe:\n\nread *, a, b, h, m\n\nwhere a, b are real, h and m integers. Wait, but in Fortran, when you read from input, the variables' types determine how they are read. So perhaps better to read all as real, or all as integers and then convert. Let's see.\n\nIn the Java code, A and B are integers, but then converted to BigDecimal. So in Fortran, perhaps they can be real variables. So let's declare them as real.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the code uses A and B as integers. For example, AA is A as BigDecimal. So A is an integer. So perhaps in Fortran, A and B are integers, but when used in calculations, they are converted to real.\n\nHmm, but in the code, the variables AA and BB are A and B as BigDecimal. Then AA is squared, etc. So perhaps in Fortran, A and B are real variables, even though they are read as integers.\n\nAlternatively, read them as integers and then convert to real. Let's see.\n\nIn Java, the code does:\n\nint A = sc.nextInt();\n...\nBigDecimal AA = new BigDecimal(A);\n\nSo A is integer input. So in Fortran, perhaps read A as integer, then convert to real.\n\nBut Fortran can handle implicit conversion. Like, if you have a real variable assigned an integer value, it's okay. So perhaps in Fortran, declare all as real and read them as integers, since the input is integers.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you read using list-directed input (like read *, a, b, h, m), if the variables are declared as real and the input is integer, it's okay. So for example, reading 3 into a real variable gives 3.0.\n\nSo perhaps the Fortran code can read all variables as real.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to read H and M as integers, but A and B as real. Hmm, but in the problem statement, A and B are likely integers. But for the purpose of calculations, they are treated as real numbers. So in Fortran, perhaps read all four variables as real.\n\nBut maybe the original code uses them as integers. Well, the Fortran code can read them as real variables. Because when the user inputs integers, the code will store them as real numbers with .0 decimal.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nCompute minute_angle = M * 6.0 degrees.\n\nhour_angle = H * 30.0 + M * 0.5 degrees.\n\nangle_diff = abs(minute_angle - hour_angle)\n\nBut since the angle could be more than 180 degrees, we should take the smaller angle between the two possible. Because in a circle, the angle between two points can be the difference or 360 minus the difference, whichever is smaller. So in Java code, the line:\n\nkaku = mkaku.subtract(hkaku);\n\nthen dkaku is the absolute value of that angle in radians. But perhaps the code does not account for the angle being more than 180 degrees. Because Math.toRadians(kaku.doubleValue()) is used, and then the absolute value. Wait, no: the code takes kaku (the difference) and then takes absolute value of the angle in radians.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nkaku = mkaku.subtract(hkaku);\n\ndkaku = Math.abs(Math.toRadians(kaku.doubleValue()));\n\nSo if the difference is 270 degrees, absolute value is 270 radians? Wait, no. Wait, the code subtracts mkaku (minute angle) and hkaku (hour angle), then converts that angle (in degrees) to radians. So if the difference is 270 degrees, that's converted to radians, then the absolute value is taken. But the minimal angle between the two hands would be 90 degrees (since 360-270=90). So the code might have a bug here. Because if the angle is more than 180, the actual angle between them is 360 - angle_diff. But since cosine is even and cos(theta) = cos(-theta) = cos(360-theta), taking the absolute value of the angle in degrees gives the same result as considering the minimal angle. Wait, but for example, if angle_diff is 270 degrees, the minimal angle is 90 degrees. cos(270) is cos(90) with a negative sign? Wait, no: cos(270 degrees) is 0, but that's not the same as 90. Wait, no: cos(270) is cos(3pi/2) which is 0. But the minimal angle between 270 and 90 is 90. So perhaps the code is wrong here, but that's how the Java code is written, and the Fortran code should follow it.\n\nSo perhaps the Java code is incorrect, but since the user wants a translation, we need to replicate the behavior.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we compute the absolute difference between the two angles (in degrees), then take that as the angle, convert to radians, compute the cosine, etc.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute the angle difference, take absolute value, convert to radians, then compute the cosine.\n\nThen apply the formula: sqrt(A^2 + B^2 - 2*A*B*cos(angle)).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nreal :: a, b, h, m\nreal :: minute_angle, hour_angle, angle_diff, radians, distance\n\nminute_angle = m * 6.0\nhour_angle = h * 30.0 + m * 0.5\nangle_diff = abs(minute_angle - hour_angle)\nradians = abs(angle_diff) * acos(-1.0) / 180.0  ! convert degrees to radians. acos(-1.0) is pi.\n\ndistance = sqrt(a**2 + b**2 - 2*a*b*cos(radians))\n\nWait, but in Java, the code uses Math.toRadians(kaku.doubleValue()), which converts degrees to radians. So the code in Java converts the angle in degrees to radians. So in Fortran, we need to compute the angle in degrees, then convert to radians by multiplying by pi/180.\n\nBut how to compute radians in Fortran. The function to convert degrees to radians is not built-in. So we multiply by pi/180. Pi can be obtained as 4.0*atan(1.0) or acos(-1.0).\n\nSo in the code:\n\nangle_diff = abs(minute_angle - hour_angle)\n\nBut in Java, they compute kaku = mkaku - hkaku, then take absolute value. So angle_diff in degrees is the absolute value of (minute_angle - hour_angle).\n\nThen, convert to radians by multiplying by pi/180.\n\nWait, but Math.toRadians(degrees) is equivalent to degrees * (pi / 180). So yes.\n\nSo in Fortran, radians = angle_diff * (acos(-1.0d0)/180.0d0). But since we need to use double precision for accurate calculations, perhaps declare variables as double precision.\n\nWait, the Java code uses BigDecimal for some steps, but eventually converts to double. So perhaps the Fortran code should use double precision to match the precision.\n\nIn Java, the code does:\n\nans2 = CC.subtract(DD);\ndans2 = ans2.doubleValue();\ndouble ans = Math.sqrt(dans2);\n\nSo the final result is a double. So in Fortran, using double precision (real*8) variables should be sufficient.\n\nSo perhaps better to use double precision variables.\n\nSo revise variables:\n\nreal*8 :: a, b, h, m\nreal*8 :: minute_angle, hour_angle, angle_diff, radians, distance\n\nWait, but h and m are integers. But in the code, they are read as integers. So maybe in Fortran, h and m are integer variables.\n\nWait, the Java code reads H and M as integers. So in Fortran, perhaps read them as integers.\n\nSo the variables:\n\ninteger :: h, m\nreal*8 :: a, b\n\nBut then the code would have to read a, b as real*8, and h, m as integers.\n\nBut in Fortran, list-directed input (read *) reads according to the variable type. So if a is real, then input 3 is read as 3.0. So perhaps it's better to read a, b as real*8, h and m as integers.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: h, m\n    real*8 :: a, b\n    real*8 :: minute_angle, hour_angle, angle_diff, radians, distance\n\n    read *, a, b, h, m\n\n    minute_angle = dble(m) * 6.0d0\n    hour_angle = dble(h) * 30.0d0 + dble(m) * 0.5d0\n    angle_diff = abs(minute_angle - hour_angle)\n    radians = angle_diff * acos(-1.0d0) / 180.0d0  ! convert degrees to radians\n\n    distance = sqrt(a**2 + b**2 - 2.0d0 * a * b * cos(radians))\n\n    print *, distance\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Java, the code takes the absolute value of the angle in radians. Wait, in Java:\n\ndkaku = Math.abs(Math.toRadians(kaku.doubleValue()));\n\nSo after converting to radians, they take the absolute value.\n\nBut in our code, angle_diff is already the absolute value of the difference in degrees, so converting that to radians is correct.\n\nWait, because angle_diff is the absolute difference between the two angles in degrees. So when converting to radians, that's correct.\n\nSo the code seems right.\n\nWait, let's test with sample input.\n\nFor example, in the problem, perhaps sample input is:\n\n3 4 9 0\n\nWhich is 9:00, so the hour is at 270 degrees, minute at 0. The difference is 270 degrees. The minimal angle is 90 degrees. But the code takes the absolute value of the difference (270 degrees), converts to radians (3pi/2), then cos(3pi/2) is 0. So the formula becomes sqrt(3^2 +4^2 - 0) =5. But according to the code, the distance would be sqrt(9+16 - 2*3*4*cos(3pi/2)), which is sqrt(25 - 24*0) =5. But the correct answer should be 5, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the actual angle between the hands is 90 degrees, but the code uses 270 degrees. But cos(270 degrees) is 0. So the code's approach is correct here. Because the code uses the absolute value of the difference, but in terms of cosine, cos(theta) is the same as cos(360-theta) only when theta is in radians. Wait, no. Cos(270 degrees) is 0, and cos(90 degrees) is 0. So in this case, the code's approach works. So even if the angle is 270 degrees, the code's calculation of cos(270 degrees) is 0, same as cos(90 degrees). Wait, no. Cos(90 degrees) is 0. Cos(270 degrees) is also 0. So for the purpose of the formula, the code would get the same result. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, cos(270 degrees) is 0. So when the code uses 270 degrees, the calculation is correct. So even though the minimal angle is 90, the code's approach gives the correct result. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code can proceed as written.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n- Read a, b as real numbers (but input as integers), h and m as integers.\n\n- Compute minute_angle = m *6 degrees.\n\n- Compute hour_angle = h*30 + m*0.5 degrees.\n\n- angle_diff is absolute difference between the two angles.\n\n- Convert angle_diff to radians.\n\n- Compute distance using law of cosines.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: h, m\n    real*8 :: a, b\n    real*8 :: minute_angle, hour_angle, angle_diff, radians, distance\n\n    read(*,*) a, b, h, m\n\n    minute_angle = m * 6.0d0\n    hour_angle = h * 30.0d0 + m * 0.5d0\n    angle_diff = abs(minute_angle - hour_angle)\n\n    radians = angle_diff * acos(-1.0d0) / 180.0d0\n\n    distance = sqrt(a**2 + b**2 - 2.0d0 * a * b * cos(radians))\n\n    write(*, \"(f0.10)\") distance\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the input variables: a and b are read as real*8, h and m as integer. So when reading, the code should have a, b, h, m in the input, separated by spaces or newlines.\n\nIn Fortran, list-directed input (read *) will read the variables according to their types. So if a and b are real*8, and h and m are integer, then the input should be four numbers: first two are real (or integer, which are converted to real), next two are integers.\n\nYes. So for example, input 3 4 9 0 would be a=3.0, b=4.0, h=9, m=0.\n\nThen:\n\nminute_angle =0 *6=0\n\nhour_angle=9*30 +0*0.5=270.\n\nangle_diff=270-0=270. Absolute is 270.\n\nradians=270 * pi/180 = 3pi/2.\n\ncos(3pi/2) is 0.\n\ndistance = sqrt(9 +16 - 2*3*4*0) = sqrt(25) =5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: say 12:00. h=12, m=0.\n\nBut in the code, h is read as integer. But when h is 12, hour_angle=12 *30 +0*0.5=360. But modulo 360, that's 0 degrees. The minute_angle is 0. So angle_diff is 0. radians 0. distance is sqrt(a^2 +b^2 -2ab*1) = sqrt( (a-b)^2 ) = |a-b|. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: 3:00, which is h=3, m=0. hour_angle=90 degrees. minute_angle=0. angle_diff=90. radians pi/2. cos(pi/2) is 0. distance sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2) (since 2ab*0 is subtracted). So if a and b are 3 and 4, sqrt(25)=5.\n\nWait, but that's only when they are aligned 90 degrees apart. Oh, no, 3:00, hour is at 90 degrees, minute at 0. The angle is 90 degrees. So the formula would compute sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 - 2ab*cos(90)), which is sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2), since cos(90) is zero. So distance is sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2). If a and b are 3 and 4, distance is 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the Java code uses BigDecimal for some parts, but in Fortran, using double-precision reals should suffice.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should read the four variables, compute the angles, then the distance.\n\nThe code should be as written."
