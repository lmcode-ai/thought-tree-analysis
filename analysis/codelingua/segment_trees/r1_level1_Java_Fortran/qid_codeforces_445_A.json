So for example, if the line is \"3 4\", the first character is '3', the second is ' ', the third is '4', etc. So in Java, the code reads n as '3', m as ' ', which would throw an error. But the user's code may have a typo here, but in any case, we have to translate the code as given. Hmm. But given that this code is from a programming competition problem, perhaps the code is correct. Wait, perhaps the problem's input has n and m as single-digit numbers, and the first line is, for example, \"34\", meaning n=3 and m=4. So the code would split into [\"3\",\"4\"], and then n=3, m=4. Then that would make sense. So perhaps the code expects that the first line is two digits without any space. Then the code would work. So the original Java code may be correct if the input is given as a two-digit number, like 34, meaning n=3, m=4. So perhaps the problem's input is such that the first line is a two-digit number, not two numbers separated by space. But that's not the usual way for programming competition problems. But perhaps the problem's input is written that way. So in that case, the code is correct. So in Fortran, the approach would be:\n\nRead the first line as a string. Then take the first character as n, the second as m. Then convert them to integers. But how to read the first line as a single string.",

So:\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: line\nread(*, '(a)') line\n\nThen, the first character is line(1:1), the second is line(2:2). So, in Fortran code:\n\nread(*, '(a)') line\nn = iachar(line(1:1)) - iachar('0')\nm = iachar(line(2:2)) - iachar('0') But this assumes that the first two characters are digits, and there's no space between them. For example, if the first line is '34', then n=3, m=4. So this would work. But if the input is '3 4', then line(1:1) is '3', line(2:2) is ' ', which would give m= -16 (since ' ' is ASCII 32, 32 -48= -16), which is invalid. So the code would fail. But the Java code would throw an exception. So perhaps the Fortran code should also handle this, but given that the user's code may have this mistake, perhaps the original problem expects the first line to be a two-digit number. So the code is written that way.

So ans(i) is a deferred-length character string (since it's declared as 'character(len=:), allocatable :: ans(:)'), and each element is allocated to length m. Then, when we assign ans(i) = '', that's not necessary. Instead, when processing each character j, we directly set ans(i)(j:j) = ... . But in Fortran, when you allocate ans as 'character(len=m) :: ans(n)', each element has length m, and is initialized to spaces. So when building ans(i), we need to replace each character j with '-' or 'B'/'W'. So, the code for processing each line is:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*, '(a)') str  !",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's look at the Java code first. So the program reads two integers n and m from input, then reads n lines of a grid. Each cell in the grid is either '-' or needs to be replaced with 'B' or 'W' based on the (i+j) parity. Then it prints the modified grid.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to read the input in Fortran. Java reads the first line, splits into parts for n and m. But in the Java code, they split by empty string? Wait, wait, looking at the code:\n\nString[] inp = buf.readLine().split(\"\");\nWait, that's splitting the input line into individual characters. But then n is parsed as the first character, m as the second. So the first line of input is a string like \"3 4\", but wait, no. Wait, if the first line is read, then split into an array using split(\"\"), which would split into each character including spaces. For example, if the input line is \"2 3\", then split into [\"2\", \" \", \"3\"]. Then n is Integer.parseInt(inp[0]) which is 2, m is inp[1] which is a space, which would throw a NumberFormatException. That can't be right. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Oh, this code probably has a bug. Because the first line is read as a line, then split by empty string, which gives an array of each character. So for example, if the input is \"3 4\", the first line is \"3 4\", which when split by \"\" gives [\"3\", \" \", \"4\"]. So inp[0] is \"3\", inp[1] is \" \", which when parsed to integer would throw an error. But that's not possible, because in the code, the code is from codeforces 445 A, which probably expects the first line to be two integers separated by space. So this code is incorrect here. Wait, perhaps the original code is using split(\" \") instead of split(\"\")? Because otherwise, the code would crash when trying to parse a space to integer.\n\nWait, this seems like a mistake. Let me check the problem statement. The problem 445A (probably \"DZY Loves Chessboard\") expects the input to be n and m on the first line. So the correct way to read them is to split by spaces, not by empty strings. So the Java code here has a mistake. But regardless, the user provided this code and wants it translated as-is.\n\nSo the Java code is splitting the first line by empty string, which will split into individual characters, including any spaces. So for the input line like \"2 3\", the split would produce [\"2\", \" \", \"3\"], so n is 2, m is 3? Wait, no, because inp[1] is \" \" which can't be parsed to an integer. So this code is incorrect. But perhaps the actual code intended to read the first line as two integers separated by space, but the code is wrong here. But the user wants the Fortran code to do the same thing as the Java code. So even if the Java code has a bug, we need to replicate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original code is written correctly and the split is by space. But in the given code, it's split(\"\"), which is a regex for empty string, which splits into each character. So that's a bug. But how to handle this in Fortran?\n\nWell, perhaps in the original code, the first line is read as a single line, then split into two integers. But the Java code here is incorrect. But regardless, we need to translate it as-is. So in the Java code, after reading the first line, split by empty string, take the first character as n, second as m. But that's not correct if the input is like \"10 20\". The first line would be \"10 20\", split into [\"1\", \"0\", \" \", \"2\", \"0\"], so n would be 1, m would be 0, which is wrong. So this Java code is incorrect. But maybe the problem was intended for n and m to be single-digit numbers, but that's unlikely. So the code probably has a mistake here.\n\nBut the user wants the code translated, so perhaps the actual code should split on space. But the user's code uses split(\"\"), which is a problem. However, perhaps the user made a typo in the code, but regardless, we have to work with the code given.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, how to replicate this? The first line is read as a string, then split into individual characters, then the first character is n, the second is m. So for example, if the first line is \"3 4\", the code would take the first character '3', which is 3, the second character ' ', which is invalid. So the code would crash. But perhaps the original code's first line is something like \"34\" (without space), then split into [\"3\",\"4\"], then n=3, m=4. But that's conflicting with the problem statement, which expects two numbers. So perhaps the Java code is wrong, but that's how it is.\n\nSo in Fortran, to read the first line, perhaps we can read the entire line as a string, then take the first character for n, second for m, regardless of spaces. For example, if the input is \"3 4\", then the first character is '3', then the second is ' ', then the third is '4', etc. But in Java's split(\"\"), the split includes all characters, including spaces. So in the code, the first line is read, split into each character, and n is the first character parsed as integer, m is the second. So if the input is \"2 3\", then the first two characters are '2' and ' ', which would cause m to be a space, leading to a NumberFormatException. So the Java code is broken. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the code, but we need to replicate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original code's first line is read correctly, and the split is on whitespace. But in the given code, the split is on empty string. So this is a problem. But regardless, the user wants to translate this code as-is. So we need to replicate the same logic in Fortran.\n\nSo, in Fortran, how to read the first line as a string, then split into individual characters, then parse the first and second characters as integers. Wait, but in Fortran, when you read a line, leading spaces may be skipped. So for example, if you read a line using 'read (*,'(a)') line', then line will contain all characters, including leading and trailing spaces. Then, perhaps take the first two non-space characters? Or perhaps, as per the Java code, take the first two characters, regardless of what they are.\n\nBut the Java code takes the first and second elements of the split array, which are the first and second characters of the line. So for example, if the line is \"3 4\", the first character is '3', the second is ' ', the third is '4', etc. So in Java, the code reads n as '3', m as ' ', which would throw an error. But the user's code may have a typo here, but in any case, we have to translate the code as given.\n\nHmm. But given that this code is from a programming competition problem, perhaps the code is correct. Wait, perhaps the problem's input has n and m as single-digit numbers, and the first line is, for example, \"34\", meaning n=3 and m=4. So the code would split into [\"3\",\"4\"], and then n=3, m=4. Then that would make sense. So perhaps the code expects that the first line is two digits without any space. Then the code would work. So the original Java code may be correct if the input is given as a two-digit number, like 34, meaning n=3, m=4. So perhaps the problem's input is such that the first line is a two-digit number, not two numbers separated by space.\n\nBut that's not the usual way for programming competition problems. But perhaps the problem's input is written that way. So in that case, the code is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, the approach would be:\n\nRead the first line as a string. Then take the first character as n, the second as m. Then convert them to integers.\n\nBut how to read the first line as a single string. In Fortran, when you read using list-directed input (read *, ...), it skips leading spaces and stops at the first space. So perhaps, read the entire line into a character variable.\n\nIn Fortran, to read the entire line, including spaces, you can use the format '(a)'. So:\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: line\nread(*, '(a)') line\n\nThen, the first character is line(1:1), the second is line(2:2).\n\nSo, in Fortran code:\n\nread(*, '(a)') line\nn = iachar(line(1:1)) - iachar('0')\nm = iachar(line(2:2)) - iachar('0')\n\nBut this assumes that the first two characters are digits, and there's no space between them. For example, if the first line is '34', then n=3, m=4. So this would work. But if the input is '3 4', then line(1:1) is '3', line(2:2) is ' ', which would give m= -16 (since ' ' is ASCII 32, 32 -48= -16), which is invalid. So the code would fail. But the Java code would throw an exception. So perhaps the Fortran code should also handle this, but given that the user's code may have this mistake, perhaps the original problem expects the first line to be a two-digit number. So the code is written that way.\n\nSo proceeding under that assumption, the Fortran code will read the first line as a string, take the first two characters as n and m, converting them from characters to integers.\n\nThen, the code reads n lines, each line is a string of m characters. For each character in the line, if it's '-', leave it as '-', else alternate 'B' and 'W' based on (i+j) parity. Wait, in the Java code, for each cell (i,j), if (i + j) is even, then 'B', else 'W'. But the code in Java is:\n\nif ((i + j) % 2 ==1) append 'W' else 'B'\n\nSo for i starting at 0 (since the loop is for i from 0 to n-1), and j from 0 to m-1. So for example, cell (0,0) would be B, (0,1) W, (1,0) W, etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So when translating the loops, need to adjust indices. For example, in Java, i is 0-based, j is 0-based. In Fortran, if we use i from 1 to n, j from 1 to m, then (i-1 + j-1) % 2 ==1? Because (i-1 + j-1) = i + j -2. So (i + j -2) mod 2. That's equivalent to (i + j) mod 2. Wait, because (i + j -2) mod 2 = (i + j) mod 2. Because subtracting 2 (which is even) doesn't change the parity. So for parity, (i-1 + j-1) % 2 is same as (i + j -2) %2, which is same as (i + j) mod 2. So the parity check can be written as (i + j) mod 2.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nOriginal Java code: (i + j) %2 ==1 --> 'W', else 'B'.\n\nIn Fortran, if i runs from 1 to n, j from 1 to m, then (i + j) mod 2. So same as Java's (i-1 + j-1) mod 2. Because (i-1)+(j-1) = i + j -2. (i + j -2) mod 2 is same as (i + j) mod 2. Because subtracting 2 (even) doesn't affect the parity.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each cell (i,j), if the original cell is '-', leave it. Otherwise, if (i + j) is even, then 'B', else 'W'. Because (i + j) mod 2 ==0 --> B.\n\nSo for each line in the input (n lines), read the line, process each character.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are fixed length, so perhaps read each line into a character variable of length m. Then process each character in the line.\n\nBut when reading the lines in Fortran, the input lines may have varying lengths. So for example, if the line is shorter than m, the remaining characters are undefined. So perhaps read each line into a variable of sufficient length, then process the first m characters.\n\nAlternatively, read each line as a character variable with a large enough length, then take the first m characters.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read first line into 'line' variable.\n\n2. Extract first two characters as n and m.\n\n3. Read n lines, each line is a string.\n\n4. For each line (i-th line), process each character j from 1 to m.\n\n5. If the character is '-', leave as '-'. Else, if (i + j) is even, 'B', else 'W'.\n\nBut in Java, the i starts at 0. In Fortran, the loop for i is from 1 to n, so the line number is i. So for the first line (i=1), j runs from 1 to m. So (i + j) mod 2.\n\nBut in Java, the i in the loop is the row index, starting at 0. So in Fortran, when processing the i-th line (1-based), it's equivalent to Java's i being i-1. So (i-1 + j-1) mod 2. Which is (i + j -2) mod 2 = (i + j) mod 2. So same as before.\n\nSo the parity check is same.\n\nNow, for the code structure.\n\nIn Fortran, the code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200) :: line\n    integer :: n, m, i, j\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: ans(:)\n    character(len=200) :: str\n\n    ! Read first line and parse n and m\n    read(*, '(a)') line\n    n = iachar(line(1:1)) - iachar('0')\n    m = iachar(line(2:2)) - iachar('0')\n\n    ! Allocate ans array with n elements, each of length m\n    allocate(character(len=m) :: ans(n))\n\n    ! Read each line and process\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*, '(a)') str\n        ans(i) = ''\n        do j = 1, m\n            if (str(j:j) == '-') then\n                ans(i)(j:j) = '-'\n            else\n                if (mod(i + j, 2) == 0) then\n                    ans(i)(j:j) = 'B'\n                else\n                    ans(i)(j:j) = 'B' ! Wait, no. Wait in Java, if (i + j) %2 ==1, then 'W', else 'B'. So mod(i + j, 2) ==1 then 'W'.\n                    ! Wait, in Java code:\n                    ! if ((i + j) % 2 == 1) temp.append(\"W\"); else append \"B\".\n                    ! So in Fortran, mod(i + j, 2) == 1 --> 'W', else 'B'.\n                    ! So in the code above, for the else case, if the character is not '-', then check mod(i + j, 2). If equal to 1, then 'W', else 'B'.\n\n                    ! So in the code:\n\n                    if (mod(i + j, 2) == 1) then\n                        ans(i)(j:j) = 'W'\n                    else\n                        ans(i)(j:j) = 'B'\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the ans array\n    do i = 1, n\n        print '(a)', ans(i)\n    end do\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the code above, when reading each line into str (of length 200), but we process the first m characters. So j runs from 1 to m.\n\nBut what if the input line is shorter than m? For example, if the line is '---' and m is 5. Then str(j:j) for j=4 and 5 would be undefined (spaces?), leading to processing as non '-', so they would get 'B' or 'W'. But according to the problem statement, the input lines should have exactly m characters. So assuming that the input is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when you read a line into a character variable, if the line is longer than the variable's length, it is truncated. So for example, if the line is longer than m, we take the first m characters.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, each line has exactly m characters.\n\nSo assuming the input is correct, the code would work.\n\nNow, the code uses an array of strings (ans) where each element is of length m. When building each ans(i), we construct it character by character.\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't modify a character variable's part unless it's a variable (not a constant). So ans(i) is a deferred-length character string (since it's declared as 'character(len=:), allocatable :: ans(:)'), and each element is allocated to length m.\n\nThen, when we assign ans(i) = '', that's not necessary. Instead, when processing each character j, we directly set ans(i)(j:j) = ... .\n\nBut in Fortran, when you allocate ans as 'character(len=m) :: ans(n)', each element has length m, and is initialized to spaces. So when building ans(i), we need to replace each character j with '-' or 'B'/'W'.\n\nSo, the code for processing each line is:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*, '(a)') str  ! Read the line into a string, may have more than m characters\n    ! process each j from 1 to m\n    do j = 1, m\n        if (str(j:j) == '-') then\n            ans(i)(j:j) = '-'\n        else\n            if (mod(i + j, 2) == 1) then\n                ans(i)(j:j) = 'W'\n            else\n                ans(i)(j:j) = 'B'\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read a line into str (a character variable of length 200), the line's characters are stored in str(1:length_of_line), and the rest are filled with spaces. So for j up to the length of the line, the characters are correct. But if the line is shorter than m, then j exceeds the actual length, and str(j:j) would be a space, which would be treated as a non '-', so replaced with B or W. But according to the problem statement, each line has m characters. So assuming the input is correct.\n\nNow, compiling and testing.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Fortran, when you read the first line using '(a)', leading and trailing spaces are included. So, for example, if the first line is '3 4', the line variable would contain '3 4' (assuming the input has that). Then, line(1:1) is '3', line(2:2) is ' ', which is parsed as m. Which would result in m being -16 (since the ASCII code for ' ' is 32, 32 - 48 = -16). Which is invalid. So the Java code would crash here. But in Fortran, the code would proceed with m = -16, leading to errors.\n\nBut according to the original Java code, this is the case, but the user wants the code translated. So perhaps the original Java code is incorrect, but the user wants the same behavior. However, in practice, the code would not work for inputs with n and m as two-digit numbers or separated by space.\n\nBut given that the user provided this code, we have to translate it as-is.\n\nSo the code would work correctly only when the first line is two digits without any space (like '34' for n=3 and m=4). Otherwise, it would have errors. But that's how the Java code is written.\n\nSo the final Fortran code would look like this."
