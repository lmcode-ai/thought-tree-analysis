    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. \n\nSo, the code reads an integer n, then reads n pairs of integers. Each pair is stored in an array called beacon, where the first number is the index and the second is the value. Then, it computes a dp array. The dp[i] represents the maximum number of beacons that can be left on up to position i without being destroyed. The maximum value in dp is found, and the result is n minus this maximum, which I guess is the minimum number of beacons to deactivate.\n\nIn Java, beacon is an array of size 1,000,001. Similarly for dp. So in Fortran, I'll need to declare arrays of that size. But Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, right? Wait, the Java code uses indexes starting from 0. Hmm, need to be careful with the array indices.\n\nWait, in the Java code, beacon is initialized to size 1,000,001. So indexes 0 to 1,000,000. But in Fortran, if I declare beacon(0:1000000), that would cover the same range. Alternatively, since in Fortran the default lower bound is 1, but in Java code, the first index is 0. So maybe in Fortran, I should adjust the indices. But perhaps it's easier to just use 0-based arrays in Fortran. Wait, Fortran allows arrays to start at any index. So I can declare the beacon array starting at 0 up to 1000000.\n\nSo first, in Fortran, I'll need to read the input. The Java code uses a scanner to read n, then n pairs of a and then beacon[a] is set to the next integer. So in Fortran, I need to read n, then loop n times, each time reading two integers a and b, then set beacon(a) = b.\n\nThen, the dp array is initialized. The code checks if beacon[0] is not zero. If so, dp[0] is set to 1. Then, for each i from 1 to 1,000,000, it checks if beacon[i] is not zero. If beacon[i] is less than i, then dp[i] is dp[i - beacon[i] -1] +1. Otherwise, if beacon[i] is not zero, dp[i] is 1. Else, dp[i] is dp[i-1]. The max is tracked, and finally, output n - max.\n\nSo in Fortran, I'll need to handle arrays of size 0:1000000. Let me think about variable declarations.\n\nIn Fortran, I can declare the arrays as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:1000000) :: beacon, dp\n\nBut wait, in Java, the arrays are initialized to zero. In Fortran, when you declare an array like that, the initial values are undefined. So I need to initialize beacon and dp arrays to zero. So perhaps:\n\nbeacon = 0\ndp = 0\n\nBut in Fortran, you can initialize the arrays with a loop, or using array constructors. But for large arrays, a loop is better. Alternatively, since Fortran allows array assignments, but for large arrays, a loop might be more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nbeacon = 0\ndp = 0\n\nBut for an array of 1,000,001 elements, that's manageable.\n\nNow, the input. How to read the input in Fortran. The Java code reads from standard input. So in Fortran, read from the console. The code first reads n, then n pairs of a and b. But in Java, a is the index in the beacon array, and the value is stored there. So in Fortran, for each pair, read a and b, then beacon(a) = b.\n\nBut need to make sure that a is within 0 to 1,000,000. But according to the problem statement, perhaps the input a's are valid.\n\nNow, after reading all the beacons, the code initializes dp[0]. If beacon[0] is not zero, then dp[0] is 1. Then for each i from 1 to 1e6, compute dp[i].\n\nThe next part is looping from 1 to 1000000. For each i:\n\nif beacon[i] !=0 and beacon[i] < i:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i - beacon[i] -1] +1\n\nelse if beacon[i] !=0:\n\ndp[i] =1\n\nelse:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1]\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to implement this logic.\n\nThen, track the maximum value in dp. Finally, output n - max.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Initialize beacon and dp arrays to zero.\n\n3. Read n pairs of a and b, set beacon(a) = b.\n\n4. Compute dp[0] as 1 if beacon[0] is non-zero, else 0.\n\nWait, Java code:\n\nif (beacon[0] != 0) dp[0] = 1;\n\nElse, dp[0] remains zero. Because initially, dp is all zero. So in Fortran, after initializing dp to zero, the same applies.\n\nThen, for i from 1 to 1e6:\n\nCheck if beacon(i) is non-zero. Then, if beacon(i) < i, then dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) -1) +1. Otherwise, dp(i) = 1. But if beacon(i) is zero, dp(i) is dp(i-1).\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i in 1 to 1e6:\n\nif (beacon(i) /= 0) then\n\n    if (beacon(i) < i) then\n\n        dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) -1) + 1\n\n    else\n\n        dp(i) = 1\n\n    end if\n\nelse\n\n    dp(i) = dp(i-1)\n\nend if\n\nThen, track the maximum value. So initialize max to zero, and for each i, compare and update.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nmax_val = 0\n\ndo i = 0, 1000000\n\n    if (dp(i) > max_val) then\n\n        max_val = dp(i)\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the max is updated in the loop where i goes from 1 to 1e6. So in the Fortran code, perhaps track the max during the loop when computing dp[i].\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < 1000001; i++) {\n\n    ... compute dp[i]\n\n    max = Math.max(max, dp[i]);\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, during the loop from i=1 to 1000000, after computing dp(i), check if it's larger than the current max, and update.\n\nSo, in the Fortran code:\n\nmax_val = 0\n\nif (beacon(0) /= 0) then\n\n    dp(0) = 1\n\n    max_val = 1\n\nelse\n\n    dp(0) = 0\n\nend if\n\nthen, for i from 1 to 1000000:\n\n    compute dp(i) as per the conditions\n\n    if dp(i) > max_val then\n\n        max_val = dp(i)\n\n    end if\n\nSo that's more efficient than looping again.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Fortran array indices start at 1? No, in this case, we can declare them starting at 0. So when declaring beacon(0:1000000), which is allowed.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the beacon array is initialized to zero for all elements. So in Fortran, after initializing beacon to zero, the same applies.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, b, i, max_val, result\n\n    integer, dimension(0:1000000) :: beacon, dp\n\n    ! Initialize arrays to zero\n\n    beacon = 0\n\n    dp = 0\n\n    ! Read n\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    ! Read n pairs\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) a, b\n\n        beacon(a) = b\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute dp(0)\n\n    if (beacon(0) /= 0) then\n\n        dp(0) = 1\n\n    else\n\n        dp(0) = 0\n\n    end if\n\n    max_val = dp(0)\n\n    ! Compute dp for i from 1 to 1000000\n\n    do i = 1, 1000000\n\n        if (beacon(i) /= 0) then\n\n            if (beacon(i) < i) then\n\n                ! Check if i - beacon(i) -1 is >=0\n\n                if (i - beacon(i) -1 >= 0) then\n\n                    dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) -1) + 1\n\n                else\n\n                    ! beacon(i) is >=i, so i - beacon(i) -1 <0, but beacon(i) <i?\n\n                    ! Wait, in the condition beacon(i) <i, so i - beacon(i) -1 >= i - (i-1) -1 = 0? Not necessarily. Wait, if beacon(i) is say 5, and i is 5, then i - beacon(i) -1 is 5-5-1= -1. But in the code, the condition is beacon(i) <i. So beacon(i) is less than i. So i - beacon(i) -1 >=0?\n\nWait, if beacon(i) <i, then beacon(i) is <=i-1, so i - beacon(i) -1 >= i - (i-1) -1 = i -i +1 -1 =0. So yes, the index is >=0.\n\nSo in that case, i - beacon(i) -1 is >=0, so no problem.\n\nSo dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) -1) +1\n\nElse if beacon(i) <i is false, but beacon(i) is not zero (but since beacon(i) >=i), then dp(i) =1.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nif (beacon(i) < i) then\n\n    dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) -1) + 1\n\nelse\n\n    dp(i) = 1\n\nend if\n\nSo no need for checking the index. Because the condition beacon(i) <i ensures that i - beacon(i) -1 is >=0.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nif (beacon(i) /= 0) then\n\n    if (beacon(i) < i) then\n\n        dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) -1) + 1\n\n    else\n\n        dp(i) = 1\n\n    end if\n\nelse\n\n    dp(i) = dp(i-1)\n\nend if\n\nThen, compare to max_val.\n\nSo after computing dp(i), check if it's larger than max_val, and update.\n\nSo putting all this into code.\n\nBut how to handle the array indices correctly in Fortran.\n\nYes, the code should work.\n\nNow, after processing all i up to 1e6, compute the result as n - max_val.\n\nThen print the result.\n\nNow, let me check possible edge cases. For example, when n is zero. But according to the code, the input is read as n, but the code reads n pairs, so if n is zero, the loop will not run. Then beacon array remains zero. Then dp(0) is zero, and max_val is zero. The result is 0 -0=0. Which seems okay.\n\nBut in the problem statement, perhaps n is at least 1. Not sure, but code should handle it.\n\nPotential issues in Fortran:\n\n- The array size is 0:1000000, which is 1,000,001 elements. That's a lot, but manageable. But in Fortran, when compiling, you need to make sure that the stack size is large enough. Alternatively, allocate the arrays dynamically.\n\nBut in the code, declaring them as static arrays may cause stack overflow. So perhaps better to use dynamic allocation. But for simplicity, maybe the code will be written with static arrays, but in practice, Fortran may not allow such large static arrays. Wait, what's the default stack size for Fortran compilers? Well, this is a possible problem. For example, in some systems, the stack may not be big enough to handle arrays of size 1e6. So to avoid stack overflow, perhaps the arrays should be allocated in the heap using the 'allocatable' attribute.\n\nSo modifying the code to use allocatable arrays.\n\nBut for the purpose of this translation, perhaps the user wants the code as written, but we need to handle that.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: beacon(:), dp(:)\n\n...\n\nallocate(beacon(0:1000000), dp(0:1000000))\n\nThen, proceed.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code may need to use 'implicit none' and declare all variables.\n\nPutting all together, here's the Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, b, i, max_val, res\n\n    integer, allocatable :: beacon(:), dp(:)\n\n    ! Allocate arrays from 0 to 1e6\n\n    allocate(beacon(0:1000000))\n\n    allocate(dp(0:1000000))\n\n    beacon = 0\n\n    dp = 0\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) a, b\n\n        beacon(a) = b\n\n    end do\n\n    if (beacon(0) /= 0) then\n\n        dp(0) = 1\n\n    else\n\n        dp(0) = 0\n\n    end if\n\n    max_val = dp(0)\n\n    do i = 1, 1000000\n\n        if (beacon(i) /= 0) then\n\n            if (beacon(i) < i) then\n\n                dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) - 1) + 1\n\n            else\n\n                dp(i) = 1\n\n            end if\n\n        else\n\n            dp(i) = dp(i-1)\n\n        end if\n\n        if (dp(i) > max_val) then\n\n            max_val = dp(i)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    res = n - max_val\n\n    print *, res\n\n    deallocate(beacon, dp)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop for i in 1 to 1000000, which is up to 1e6 inclusive. Because Java's for loop is i < 1000001, which is 0 to 1e6. So the Fortran code loops from 1 to 1e6, which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the Java code, when beacon[i] is not zero and beacon[i] >=i, then dp[i] is set to 1. So that's correct.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nBut need to test possible cases.\n\nTest case:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6\n\n1 2\n\n0 7\n\n3 3\n\n4 1\n\n5 1\n\n6 1\n\nSample Output: 3\n\nWait, according to the original problem, perhaps. But I'm not sure, but the code should handle that.\n\nBut the translation seems correct. The main points are:\n\n- Allocating arrays of size 0:1e6.\n\n- Reading input correctly.\n\n- Handling dp array as per the conditions.\n\n- Calculating max_val during the loop.\n\n- Finally, output n - max_val.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be as written."
