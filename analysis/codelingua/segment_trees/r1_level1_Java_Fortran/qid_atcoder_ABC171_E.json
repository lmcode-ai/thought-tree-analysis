    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the code reads an integer n from the input. Then it creates an array a of size n. It initializes a variable r to 0. It then loops through each element of the array, reading the next integer into a[i] and XORing it with r. So r becomes the cumulative XOR of all elements in the array.\n\nAfter that, it loops through the array again, and for each element, it prints out r XOR a[i], with spaces between them except for the first element. \n\nSo the main steps are: read n, read array, compute XOR of all elements, then output each element as r XOR a[i].\n\nNow, how to do this in Fortran?\n\nFortran uses different input/output methods. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, declaring variables. In Fortran, integers are declared with integer. The array a would be an allocatable array since its size is determined at runtime. Variables like n, r, i would be integers.\n\nReading input: In Fortran, we can use read(*,*) to read from standard input. For reading n first, then the array elements.\n\nComputing the XOR: In Java, the ^ operator is used for XOR. In Fortran, the equivalent is ieor function from the intrinsic module. So I need to use ieor(r, a(i)) for each element to compute the cumulative XOR.\n\nThen, after computing r as the XOR of all elements, loop through the array again and compute r XOR each element, then print them with spaces.\n\nHandling the output with spaces between elements. In Java, the first element doesn't have a preceding space. In Fortran, one approach is to build a string with all the numbers separated by spaces, or output each number with a leading space, but then the first element would have an extra space. Alternatively, print the first element without a space and the rest with a space before. Or, collect all the elements into a string array and write them as a space-separated line.\n\nAnother approach is to use advance='no' in Fortran's print statements to prevent new lines. So for each element except the last, print with a space and no new line, then print the last element normally. But handling that might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, use an internal file (a character variable) to build the output string.\n\nWait, perhaps the simplest way is to loop through the array, and for each element, if it's the first, print without leading space, else print with a leading space, but using non-advancing output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, build a formatted string. Let's see. For example, using a loop to create a string that has all the elements separated by spaces. Then print that string. But in Fortran, strings are fixed-length unless using allocatable characters, which can be cumbersome. Alternatively, write each element to a buffer with a format.\n\nWait, in Fortran 2003, you can use an unlimited format item. So maybe:\n\nprint '(*(i0,1x))', (ieor(r, a(i)), i=1, n)\n\nBut does that work? The unlimited format item (the *) would repeat the format items as needed, so if you have (i0,1x) for each element, but the last element would have a trailing space. But in the Java code, the output has a space between elements, including the last one. Wait, let me check the Java code.\n\nLooking at the Java code: in the loop, if i !=0, print a space. So the first element is printed without a space, then each subsequent element is preceded by a space. So the output would be \"element1 element2 element3... \" with a trailing space? Or no. Wait, for example, if n is 3, elements are printed as \"e1 e2 e3\" \u2014 no trailing space. Because the loop for i=0 (if n=3, indexes 0,1,2), when i=0, no space, then for i=1, print a space before e1? Wait, the Java code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (i != 0) System.out.print(\" \");\n    System.out.print(r ^ a[i]);\n}\n\nSo for i=0, the if condition is false, so no space is printed. Then the element is printed. Then for i=1, the space is printed, then the element. So the output is e0 e1 e2 (with n=3), each separated by space, no leading or trailing space. So the Fortran code must produce the same.\n\nThe Fortran code using the format '(*(i0,1x))' would produce e0 e1 e2 followed by a space. Because each element is printed with a space. So for n elements, the format would generate n elements each followed by a space, leading to a trailing space. Which is not desired.\n\nSo to avoid that, perhaps in Fortran, the approach is to print the first element without a leading space, then the rest with a leading space. But how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop where for each element, if it's the first, print without leading space, else print with a leading space, using non-advancing output.\n\nFor example:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    if (i == 1) then\n        write(*, '(i0)', advance='no') ieor(r, a(i))\n    else\n        write(*, '(a, i0)', advance='no') ' ', ieor(r, a(i))\n    endif\nenddo\nprint *  ! to add a new line\n\nWait, but after writing all elements with advance='no', the print * adds a new line. That might work.\n\nYes. So for the first element, we write it without a space and without advancing. For the subsequent elements, we write a space followed by the element, again without advancing. Then, after the loop, we print a new line.\n\nSo let's structure that loop.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nNow, the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n\n2. Allocate array a with size n.\n\n3. Read n integers into a.\n\n4. Compute r as the cumulative XOR of all elements in a.\n\n5. Loop through each element in a, compute r XOR a[i], and print them with spaces in between.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC171_E\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, r\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n    \n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(a(n))\n    read(*,*) a\n    \n    r = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        r = ieor(r, a(i))\n    end do\n    \n    do i = 1, n\n        if (i == 1) then\n            write(*, '(i0)', advance='no') ieor(r, a(i))\n        else\n            write(*, '(a, i0)', advance='no') ' ', ieor(r, a(i))\n        end if\n    end do\n    print *\n    \nend program atcoder_ABC171_E\n\nWait, but in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default unless specified otherwise. The original Java code uses 0-based indices, but the Fortran code uses 1-based. So when reading the array elements, it's a(1), a(2), etc. Which is correct.\n\nTesting this code with sample input.\n\nFor example, if n=3 and the input is 1 2 3.\n\nJava code: r = 1 ^ 2 ^3 = (1^2)=3, 3^3=0. Then each element is 0^1=1, 0^2=2, 0^3=3. So output is \"1 2 3\".\n\nFortran code: a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=3. r is 1 ^2=3, then 3^3=0. Then in the loop, each element is 0 XOR a(i). So outputs 1,2,3. The first element is printed with no space, others with a leading space. So the output is \"1 2 3\" followed by a new line. Which matches.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a=[5,7]. Java code: r=5^7=2. Then outputs 2^5=7, 2^7=5. So output \"7 5\".\n\nFortran code would compute same.\n\nSo this should be correct.\n\nPotential issues: Make sure that the ieor function is correctly used. Also, in Fortran, the read statement for the array. If the input is given as a single line with n elements, read(*,*) a will read all the elements. So the code expects that after reading n, the next read is the array elements.\n\nYes, the original Java code reads the array elements in a loop. So the input is n followed by n elements. So in Fortran, read n, then allocate a(n), then read a.\n\nThis should work.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
