Then i=1 (element 2, next is 3: add. Then i=0 (element 1, next is 2: add. So count is 4+3+2+1=10. But perhaps in cases where there are duplicates, like [2,2,3], sorted to [2,2,3]. The code would first take 3 (count=3). Then process the second 2 (i=1). Since 2 < 3, add to count (count=5). Then process the first 2 (i=0).",

Then the first element: 3. But after the previous step, the middle element is 2. So the next element (a[i+1] is the middle element, which is 2.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first to understand what it's doing.\n\nThe Java program reads an integer n, then reads n long integers into an array. It sorts the array in ascending order. Then it starts from the second last element and works backwards. For each element, if it's less than the next one, it adds it to the count. Otherwise, it decrements the current element until it's less than the next, but not below zero. Then adds it to the count if it's positive.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read array of n elements.\n3. Sort array.\n4. Initialize count with the last element.\n5. Loop from n-2 down to 0:\n   a. Compare current element with next.\n   b. If current is smaller, add to count.\n   c. Else, decrement current until it's less than next, and add if >0.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about data types. In Java, they're using Long, which is 64-bit integer. In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for that. But Fortran's default integers might not be 64-bit, so maybe we should use integer(8) or a kind parameter.\n\nFirst, the reading part. In Java, Scanner reads input. In Fortran, we use read(*,*) to read from standard input. Let's see: the first input is an integer n. Then read n long integers.\n\nIn Fortran, dynamic arrays can be allocated. So declare an array, say, a(n), read into it. Then sort.\n\nFortran doesn't have a built-in sort function, so we need to implement a sorting algorithm. The Java code uses Arrays.sort which sorts in ascending order. So in Fortran, after sorting, the array is in ascending order, and the code starts from the end. Wait, in Java, after sorting, the array is ascending. Then the loop starts from the end (n-1) element as the first count, then n-2 down to 0. Wait, the Java code initializes count as the last element (ans[n-1]), then loops from i = n-2 down to 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to sort the array in ascending order. Then proceed similarly.\n\nImplementing a sort in Fortran. For simplicity, maybe a bubble sort, but since performance isn't a concern here (assuming the problem constraints are manageable), but for code translation, a simple sort is okay. Alternatively, use an existing sort algorithm.\n\nBut perhaps the original code uses a standard sort, which for objects is a mergesort. But in Fortran, implementing a quick sort or similar.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is sorted in ascending order, and the code processes elements from largest to smallest, but after sorting, the array is in ascending order. Wait, no. Let's see: the original code sorts the array in ascending order. Then the first element is the smallest. But the code starts adding from the last element (the largest), then proceeds to the previous element. So in the Java code, after sorting, the array is in ascending order, and the code processes elements in reverse order (from largest to smaller). Wait, the loop is for i from n-2 down to 0. Wait, the array is sorted in ascending order, so ans[0] is the smallest, ans[n-1] is the largest.\n\nThe code starts with count = ans[n-1], then for each i from n-2 down to 0:\n\nIf ans[i] < ans[i+1], then add to count. Otherwise, decrement ans[i] until it's less than ans[i+1], then add if positive.\n\nSo the elements after sorting are in ascending order, but processed in reverse. So for example, sorted array is [1, 3, 3, 5]. Then processing starts with 5, then 3 (but since 3 is equal to next (but next is 3?), wait no. Wait, the array is sorted in ascending order. So after sorting, the array is from smallest to largest. Then in the loop, when i is n-2, which is the second to last element. So for example, if the sorted array is [a0, a1, ..., a(n-1)], then the loop starts with i = n-2, which is a(n-2). The next element is a(i+1) which is a(n-1).\n\nSo in the first iteration of the loop, a[i] is the second largest element. Then the code compares it to the next element (the largest). So if the second largest is less than the largest, add it. Otherwise, decrement until it's smaller.\n\nWait, but the array is sorted in ascending order. So initially, a(n-2) is less than or equal to a(n-1). Because the array is sorted. So after sorting, for example, the array could be [1,2,3,4], then when processing 3 (i=2 in a 4-element array), the next element is 4, so 3 is less than 4: add 3 to count. Then i=1 (element 2, next is 3: add. Then i=0 (element 1, next is 2: add. So count is 4+3+2+1=10. But perhaps in cases where there are duplicates, like [2,2,3], sorted to [2,2,3]. The code would first take 3 (count=3). Then process the second 2 (i=1). Since 2 < 3, add to count (count=5). Then process the first 2 (i=0). Since 2 is not less than the next (which is 2), decrement to 1. Then add (count=6). So total is 3+2+1=6.\n\nSo the key is that after sorting, each element (processed in reverse order) must be strictly less than the previous one (the next element in the array during processing). So the code ensures that each element is strictly less than the one after it (in the original array's order, but since processed in reverse, the array is ascending, and we are processing from higher indices down).\n\nWait, perhaps the sorted array is [a0, a1, a2, ..., a(n-1)] in ascending order. So when processing in reverse order (from a(n-1), then a(n-2), etc.), the code wants each a[i] to be less than a[i+1]. But since the array is sorted, a[i] <= a[i+1]. So when processing a[i], if a[i] is equal to a[i+1], then we need to decrement a[i] until it's less than a[i+1].\n\nSo the code's logic is that after processing, each element in the array (after modification) is strictly less than the next element (in the original sorted order). Wait, no, because the array is sorted in ascending order, but during processing, the code modifies previous elements (those with lower indices) to be less than the next. For example, in the sorted array [3,3,3], the code would process the last 3 (count=3), then the middle one: since 3 is not less than next (3), decrement to 2. Then add 2 to count (total 5). Then the first element: 3. But after the previous step, the middle element is 2. So the next element (a[i+1] is the middle element, which is 2. So the first element (3) must be decremented to 1 (since 3 >=2, decrement until less than 2). Then add 1. Total 3+2+1=6.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to do the same steps.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, read n, then read n integers as an array.\n\nThen sort the array in ascending order. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort, I need to implement a sorting algorithm.\n\nFor simplicity, perhaps using a bubble sort. Let's see. For an array a of size n, sorted in ascending order.\n\nBut bubble sort is O(n^2), but for the purpose of code translation, maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, use a more efficient algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic function to sort. Wait, does Fortran have a sort function?\n\nI recall that Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function for arrays. So I'll have to implement it.\n\nSo let's proceed with implementing a simple sort. Let's use a selection sort or bubble sort.\n\nAlternatively, in the Java code, the array is of Long objects, which when sorted in ascending order. So the Fortran code needs to sort the array in ascending order.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n- Declare variables: integer n, integer(8) array (allocatable), integer(8) count, etc.\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Allocate the array.\n\n- Read the array elements.\n\n- Sort the array in ascending order.\n\n- Then process the elements as per the Java code.\n\nNow, the sorting part. Let's implement a simple bubble sort in ascending order.\n\nBut bubble sort is easy to code.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is small (probably for code submission purposes), bubble sort is acceptable.\n\nSo code for bubble sort:\n\ndo i = 1, n-1\n    do j = 1, n-i\n        if (a(j) > a(j+1)) then\n            temp = a(j)\n            a(j) = a(j+1)\n            a(j+1) = temp\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default. But the original code uses 0-based indices. So in the Java code, the array is 0-based. But in Fortran, we can use 1-based indices. So when translating, the first element is a(1), etc.\n\nBut in the Java code, after sorting, ans[0] is the smallest. So in Fortran, after sorting in ascending order, a(1) is the smallest, a(n) is the largest.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after sorting, the code initializes count as a(n), then loops from i = n-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for i from n-2 down to 0. Because the array is 0-based. For example, if n is 3, the indices are 0,1,2. So n-1 is 2, and i starts at n-2=1, then 0.\n\nIn Fortran, with 1-based indices, for n elements, the last element is a(n), and the loop would be from i = n-1 downto 1.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ncount = a(n)\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n    if (a(i) < a(i+1)) then\n        count = count + a(i)\n    else\n        do while (a(i) >= a(i+1))\n            a(i) = a(i) - 1\n        end do\n        if (a(i) > 0) then\n            count = count + a(i)\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, after modifying a[i], the next elements have already been processed, so for example, when processing i, the a[i+1] has already been set (since processing in reverse order). So in Fortran, the same applies.\n\nBut in the Java code, during the decrementing of a[i], the a[i+1] is the one that was processed earlier. For example, when processing i = n-2, the a[i+1] is the last element, which was already added to count. So modifying a[i] to be less than a[i+1], which is the previous element in processing order.\n\nSo the Fortran code would do the same.\n\nNow, potential issues:\n\n- The data type: Java uses Long (64-bit integers). So in Fortran, we should use integer(8) to have the same capacity.\n\n- Reading the input: ensure that the input is read as integer(8).\n\n- The loop variables and array indices: Fortran is 1-based, Java 0-based.\n\n- The sorting: must be in ascending order.\n\nSo let's code step by step.\n\nFirst, variable declarations.\n\nprogram codeforces_624_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, j\n    integer(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n    integer(8) :: count, temp\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(a(n))\n    read(*,*) (a(i), i=1, n)\n\n    ! Sort the array in ascending order\n    do i = 1, n-1\n        do j = 1, n-i\n            if (a(j) > a(j+1)) then\n                temp = a(j)\n                a(j) = a(j+1)\n                a(j+1) = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    ! Initialize count with the last element\n    count = a(n)\n\n    ! Process elements from n-1 downto 1\n    do i = n-1, 1, -1\n        if (a(i) < a(i+1)) then\n            count = count + a(i)\n        else\n            ! Decrement until a(i) < a(i+1)\n            do while (a(i) >= a(i+1))\n                a(i) = a(i) - 1\n            end do\n            if (a(i) > 0) then\n                count = count + a(i)\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    print *, count\n\n    deallocate(a)\nend program codeforces_624_B\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the array is sorted in ascending order, so when processing in reverse, the first element processed is a(n-1), which is the second last element. Wait, no. Let's see: in Java, after sorting, the array is from smallest to largest. The code starts with count = a[n-1], which is the largest. Then the loop runs from i = n-2 downto 0. So for each i, the element is a[i], and the next element is a[i+1]. So in the first iteration, i = n-2: a[i] is the second largest element, and a[i+1] is the largest.\n\nIn Fortran, after sorting, the array is a(1) (smallest) to a(n) (largest). The code initializes count with a(n), then loops i from n-1 downto 1. For each i, the element is a(i), and the next is a(i+1). But since the array is sorted in ascending order, a(i) <= a(i+1). So in the first iteration, a(i) is a(n-1) which is <= a(n). So if it's equal, the code will decrement a(i) until it's less than a(n).\n\nYes. So this should work.\n\nTesting this code with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\n3 3 3\n\nJava code:\n\nSorts to [3,3,3].\n\ncount starts as 3.\n\ni=1 (second 3), a(1) is 3, a(2) is 3. Since equal, decrement a(1) to 2. Now 2 < 3. Add 2. count=5.\n\ni=0 (first 3 in Java). But in Fortran, i loops down to 1. So in Fortran, for n=3, i runs from 2 downto 1. So first iteration i=2 (a(2) is 3, a(3) is 3). Then decrements a(2) to 2, then add. Then i=1 (a(1) is 3, a(2) is 2. So since 3 >=2, decrement until 1. Add 1. Total 3+2+1=6.\n\nSo in Fortran code, after sorting, a is [3,3,3]. Then:\n\ncount = 3 (a(3)).\n\ni=2 (a(2) is 3. a(3) is 3. So enter else loop. Decrement a(2) to 2. Then add. count=5.\n\nNext i=1: a(1) is 3. a(2) is 2. So 3 >=2. Enter else loop. Decrement a(1) until 1. Then add 1. count=6.\n\nSo output is 6.\n\nWhich matches the Java code.\n\nAnother test case: input 4 1 3 3 5. Sorted as 1 3 3 5.\n\nJava code:\n\ncount starts with 5.\n\ni=2 (second 3). Since 3 <5: add 3. count=8.\n\ni=1 (third element in Java, which is the first 3). a[i] is 3, next is 3. So decrement to 2. add 2. count=10.\n\ni=0 (1): a[0] is 1, next is 2. add 1. count=11.\n\nSo total 5+3+2+1=11.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nsorted array is 1,3,3,5.\n\ncount =5.\n\ni=3 (a(3)=3, a(4)=5). 3 <5: add 3. count=8.\n\ni=2 (a(2)=3, a(3)=3). decrement to 2. add 2. count=10.\n\ni=1 (a(1)=1, a(2)=2. 1<2: add 1. count=11.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: input 2 5 5. Java code:\n\ncount=5. Then i=0 (5). Since 5 >=5, decrement to 4. add 4. total 9.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nsorted array [5,5]. Wait, no: sorted in ascending order would be 5,5. Then count =5 (a(2)).\n\ni=1: a(1)=5 >= a(2)=5. decrement until 4. add 4. total 5+4=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Data types: Fortran's integer may default to 32-bit. So we need to declare variables as integer(8) to handle large numbers.\n\nIn the code, when reading input, the variables should be read as integer(8). But in Fortran, when using read(*,*), it's formatted input, and the kind is determined by the variable. So as long as a(i) is integer(8), reading into it will work.\n\nThus, the code should correctly handle large numbers.\n\nEdge cases: when a[i] becomes zero. For example, input is 2 1 1. Then sorted [1,1]. Then:\n\ncount =1. i=1: a(1)=1 >= a(2)=1. Decrement to 0. Then since 0 is not >0, don't add. So count remains 1.\n\nWhich matches the Java code.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nThus, the translated Fortran code should work."
