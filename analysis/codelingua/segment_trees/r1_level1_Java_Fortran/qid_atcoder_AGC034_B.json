Then i becomes 6. Position 6 is B. But no next character. So processed string is A D D B.\n\nWait, original input is \"ABCBCB\". Let's process it:\n\nOriginal string is:\n\nIndices (Java is 0-based, Fortran 1-based):\n\n1: A\n\n2: B\n\n3: C \u2192 BC \u2192 replace with D. So t(1) = D, i becomes 4.\n\ni=4: character is B (index 4 in Fortran, which is 5th character?), wait the original string is A B C B C B.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ni starts at 1. Check if s(1:1) is 'B'? No. So t(1:1) = A, j=2, i=2. i=2: check s(2:2) is B. Next character s(3:3) is C \u2192 replace with D. So t(2:2) = D, j=3, i=4. i=4: s(4:4) is B, check next character s(5:5) is C \u2192 replace with D. t(3:3) = D, j=4, i=6.\n\ni=6: s(6:6) is B. Next character is beyond the length (n=6?), so no. So t(4:4) = B, j=5, i=7. Loop ends. So processed string is t(1:4) = A D D B.\n\nThen, the code loops through i=1 to j-1=4-1=4? Wait j was incremented to 5, so j-1=4. So loop i from 1 to 4.\n\nCharacters: A (i=1) \u2192 tmp=1.\n\nD (i=2) \u2192 cnt +=1 \u2192 cnt=1.\n\nD (i=3) \u2192 cnt +=1 \u2192 cnt=2.\n\nB (i=4) \u2192 tmp=0. So output is 2.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's look at the Java code first. The main part is the solve method in the BABC class. The program reads a string, replaces all occurrences of \"BC\" with \"D\", and then counts something based on the occurrences of 'A' and 'D'. \n\nFirst, the input string is processed by replacing BC with D. Then, the algorithm iterates through each character. When an 'A' is encountered, a temporary counter (tmp) is incremented. When a 'D' is found, the cnt variable adds the current tmp value. Any other character (like 'B' or 'C' not part of BC, or others) resets tmp to zero. Finally, cnt is printed.\n\nSo the core logic is replacing BC with D, then counting the number of A's before each D, accumulating that count. Because BC is replaced with D, the original code treats BC as a single unit.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Reading the input: In Java, it's using Scanner to read a string. In Fortran, we can read from standard input using a character variable. Fortran has a maximum length for character variables, but perhaps we can read into a sufficiently large variable. Let's say we use a character array of size 100000 or something, assuming the input isn't too big.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read into a character variable with a certain length, it reads that many characters. So if the input is longer than the declared length, it would be truncated. So maybe we need to read the entire line. Alternatively, perhaps the input is a single word, and we can read it as a single string. Let's check the problem statement. But since the code uses in.next(), which in Java reads the next token, perhaps the input is a single string with no spaces. So in Fortran, reading a single string should suffice.\n\nSo, read the input string. Then, process it to replace all \"BC\" with \"D\". Hmm. How to replace BC with D in Fortran? Let's think.\n\nIn Java, replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\") replaces all occurrences. In Fortran, we can loop through the string and build a new string where each occurrence of BC is replaced with D. For example, iterate through the original string, check for consecutive 'B' and 'C' characters, and replace them with 'D', then skip the next character. Otherwise, append the current character.\n\nAlternatively, process the original string and create a new string where each BC is replaced by D. Let's see. Let's assume the original string is S, and the new string is T. We can loop through S from 1 to len(S), but when we find S(i) is 'B' and S(i+1) is 'C', then we add 'D' to T and increment i by 2. Otherwise, add S(i) and increment i by 1. Wait, but in Fortran, strings are fixed-length, so perhaps we can create a temporary array of characters and track the position.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n- Read the input string.\n- Preprocess it to replace BC with D.\n- Then, iterate through the processed string, keeping track of tmp and cnt.\n\nSo first, the replacement part. Let's create a new string where BC becomes D.\n\nFor example:\n\nOriginal string: ABCBCB\nProcess: A B C B C B \u2192 after replacing BC with D: A D B C B? Wait, no. Let's see. Let's process each pair:\n\nIndices 1 and 2: B and C \u2192 replace with D. Then index 3 is next. But if the original is \"BCBC\", then replacing each BC with D would result in \"DD\".\n\nSo, for the replacement, we need to scan the original string, checking each position. If the current character is 'B' and the next is 'C', replace them with 'D' and skip the next character. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo let's implement that in Fortran. Let's say the original string is s, and the new string is t. We can initialize t as an empty string (or an array of characters), and loop through i from 1 to len(s). If s(i:i) is 'B' and the next character (if exists) is 'C', then we append 'D' to t and increment i by 1. Otherwise, append s(i:i) and proceed.\n\nBut in Fortran, since strings are fixed-length, perhaps it's easier to use a character array with a large enough size. Let's assume the maximum length after replacement is the same as the original (since each BC is two characters replaced by one D, so the length can't exceed the original). Wait, no. For example, a string of BCBC would become DD, so the length is halved. But perhaps in practice, the input is not too long. But how to handle that in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, we can preallocate a new string of the same length as the original, and build it step by step, keeping track of the current position in the new string.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nInitialize a new string t as all spaces, with the same length as s. Then, have a pointer j for the current position in t. Iterate i from 1 to len(s):\n\n- If i is at len(s), then just add s(i) to t (if not part of BC).\n- Else, check if s(i) is 'B' and s(i+1) is 'C'. If yes, add 'D' to t at position j, increment j by 1, and increment i by 2.\n- Else, add s(i) to t(j), increment j by 1, and i by 1.\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop can be handled with a do loop, but incrementing i by 2 when needed. However, in a do loop, the loop variable is controlled, so perhaps a while loop approach using a variable for i.\n\nSo, code outline for the replacement:\n\ninteger :: i, j, n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s, t\n\ns = ... ! read input\n\nn = len_trim(s) ! assuming no trailing spaces\n\nallocate(character(len=n) :: t) ! maximum possible length after replacement?\n\ni = 1\nj = 1\ndo while (i <= n)\n    if (i < n .and. s(i:i) == 'B' .and. s(i+1:i+1) == 'C') then\n        t(j:j) = 'D'\n        j = j + 1\n        i = i + 2\n    else\n        t(j:j) = s(i:i)\n        j = j + 1\n        i = i + 1\n    endif\nend do\n\nThen, the actual processed string is t(1:j-1), since j is the next position to write. Wait, but in Fortran, if t is allocated with length n, then after processing, the actual length is j-1. But in Fortran, the string is fixed-length. So perhaps, after processing, we can adjust the string to the actual length. For example, create a new string of length j-1 and assign t(1:j-1) to it. But in Fortran, strings cannot be dynamically resized easily. Alternatively, we can process the original string, and when building the new string, track the current length. Then, after processing, we can have a substring of t up to j-1.\n\nWait, but Fortran requires that the length of a character variable is known at compile time unless it is allocatable. So perhaps:\n\nWe can use an allocatable character variable for t, and reallocate as needed. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, since the maximum possible length of the processed string is the same as the original (since BC is replaced by D, which takes one character, but each BC is two characters, so the processed string could be up to the original length, but perhaps shorter. Wait, no. For example, if the original string has even number of BCs, then the length can be reduced. For example, \"BCBC\" becomes \"DD\" (length 4 \u2192 2). So the maximum possible length is the original length. So if we allocate a new string of the same length as the original, it's sufficient.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each BC, we replace two characters (B and C) with one D. So the processed string can have a maximum length of the original length. For example, if the original has no BCs, then t will be the same as s. If there are BCs, the t is shorter. So allocating a string of the original length is sufficient.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nRead the input string, trim it (assuming no leading/trailing spaces?), then process.\n\nNow, for the counting part. After processing the string, we need to loop through each character, track tmp and cnt.\n\nIn Java:\n\ntmp starts at 0. For each character in the processed string:\n\n- if 'A', tmp += 1\n- else if 'D', cnt += tmp\n- else, tmp = 0\n\nSo in Fortran, after processing the string into t (up to j-1 characters), loop from 1 to len_trim(t), check each character.\n\nSo code outline:\n\ninteger :: i, tmp, cnt\ntmp = 0\ncnt = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(t)\n    if (t(i:i) == 'A') then\n        tmp = tmp + 1\n    else if (t(i:i) == 'D') then\n        cnt = cnt + tmp\n    else\n        tmp = 0\n    endif\nenddo\n\nThen, print cnt.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut how to read the input string? In Fortran, using read(*, '(a)') s. But Fortran's read can read up to the length of the variable. So we need to declare s as a sufficiently long character variable. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\n\nBut if the input is longer than 100000 characters, this will truncate. But assuming that the problem's input constraints are acceptable with this.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input string into s, then process as above.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100000) :: s, t\n    integer :: i, j, n, tmp, cnt\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*, '(a)') s\n    s = adjustl(s)  ! Remove leading spaces? Or trim?\n    n = len_trim(s)\n\n    ! Replace BC with D\n    t = ''  ! Initialize t to empty? Or allocate?\n    ! Wait, t is declared as len=100000. So initially filled with spaces.\n    t = repeat(' ', 100000)  ? Not needed, since in declaration it's initialized with spaces.\n\n    i = 1\n    j = 1\n    do while (i <= n)\n        if (i < n) then\n            if (s(i:i) == 'B' .and. s(i+1:i+1) == 'C') then\n                t(j:j) = 'D'\n                j = j + 1\n                i = i + 2\n                cycle\n            endif\n        endif\n        t(j:j) = s(i:i)\n        j = j + 1\n        i = i + 1\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, process the t string up to j-1 characters\n    tmp = 0\n    cnt = 0\n    do i = 1, j-1\n        if (t(i:i) == 'A') then\n            tmp = tmp + 1\n        else if (t(i:i) == 'D') then\n            cnt = cnt + tmp\n        else\n            tmp = 0\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, cnt\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the original code, after replacement, the code uses s.length() which is the length of the new string. In our code, the processed string is stored in t, but up to j-1 characters. So when we loop from 1 to j-1, that's correct.\n\nBut in the code above, the variable t is declared as len=100000, same as s. But during processing, when we write to t(j:j), j starts at 1 and increments. So after processing, the actual processed string is t(1:j-1). So in the loop for counting, we loop from i=1 to j-1.\n\nBut wait, when j is 1, j-1 is 0, so the loop would not execute, which is correct if there are no characters.\n\nSo this should handle the processed string correctly.\n\nTesting this code against the Java code.\n\nExample input: \"ABCBCB\"\n\nJava code would replace BC with D, resulting in \"ADBD\". Then, the process:\n\nA \u2192 tmp=1\nD \u2192 cnt +=1 \u2192 cnt=1\nB \u2192 tmp=0\nD \u2192 cnt +=0 \u2192 cnt=1\nSo output is 1 + 0 = 1? Wait no:\n\nWait the processed string after replacement would be \"ADBD\"?\n\nOriginal input: \"ABCBCB\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\nOriginal s: A B C B C B \u2192 when processing BCs:\n\n- Positions 2-3: BC \u2192 replace with D. So first part is A followed by D. Then next i is 4.\nPosition 4 is B, position 5 is C \u2192 replace with D. So next is D. Then i becomes 6. Position 6 is B. But no next character. So processed string is A D D B.\n\nWait, original input is \"ABCBCB\". Let's process it:\n\nOriginal string is:\n\nIndices (Java is 0-based, Fortran 1-based):\n\n1: A\n\n2: B\n\n3: C \u2192 BC \u2192 replace with D. So t(1) = D, i becomes 4.\n\ni=4: character is B (index 4 in Fortran, which is 5th character?), wait the original string is A B C B C B.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ni starts at 1. Check if s(1:1) is 'B'? No. So t(1:1) = A, j=2, i=2.\n\ni=2: check s(2:2) is B. Next character s(3:3) is C \u2192 replace with D. So t(2:2) = D, j=3, i=4.\n\ni=4: s(4:4) is B, check next character s(5:5) is C \u2192 replace with D. t(3:3) = D, j=4, i=6.\n\ni=6: s(6:6) is B. Next character is beyond the length (n=6?), so no. So t(4:4) = B, j=5, i=7. Loop ends.\n\nSo processed string is t(1:4) = A D D B.\n\nThen, the code loops through i=1 to j-1=4-1=4? Wait j was incremented to 5, so j-1=4. So loop i from 1 to 4.\n\nCharacters: A (i=1) \u2192 tmp=1.\n\nD (i=2) \u2192 cnt +=1 \u2192 cnt=1.\n\nD (i=3) \u2192 cnt +=1 \u2192 cnt=2.\n\nB (i=4) \u2192 tmp=0.\n\nSo output is 2. But according to the Java code, what would be the output?\n\nOriginal Java code would process the string \"ABCBCB\" \u2192 replace BC with D \u2192 \"ADBD\".\n\nWait, original string is \"ABCBCB\". Let's see:\n\nThe string is \"A BC BC B\". Replacing BC with D gives \"A D D B\".\n\nBut wait, original input \"ABCBCB\" is A followed by BC (positions 2-3), then BC (positions 4-5), then B. So replacing BC with D would give A D D B. So the processed string is \"ADDB\".\n\nThen, the code counts:\n\nA \u2192 tmp=1.\n\nD \u2192 cnt +=1 \u2192 cnt=1.\n\nD \u2192 cnt +=1 \u2192 cnt=2.\n\nB \u2192 tmp=0.\n\nSo the Java code would output 2. So the Fortran code would output 2, which matches.\n\nAnother example: input \"ABC\".\n\nJava code replaces BC with D \u2192 \"AD\". Then, tmp increments to 1 when A is processed, then D adds 1 to cnt. So output is 1.\n\nFortran code would process this correctly.\n\nAnother test case: \"AAABCBC\". Replaced to \"AAADBC\" (Wait, original is \"AAABCBC\". Let's see: the first BC is at positions 4-5 (A A A B C B C?), wait the string is \"AAABCBC\". Let's process:\n\nIndices:\n\n1: A\n\n2: A\n\n3: A\n\n4: B\n\n5: C \u2192 replace BC (indices 4-5) with D. Then next i is 6. s(6:6) is B, s(7:7) is C \u2192 another BC \u2192 replace with D. So processed string is \"AAADDD\".\n\nWait, original string is AAABCBC: A A A B C B C. So the BCs are at positions 4-5 and 6-7. So replaced with D each. So processed string is \"AAAD D D\".\n\nThen, the counting:\n\nA A A D D D.\n\nEach A increments tmp. So after three A's, tmp=3. Then each D adds 3, 3, 3. So cnt is 3*3=9.\n\nJava code would output 9. Fortran code should do the same.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nBut wait, in the Fortran code, after replacing BC with D, the code may have trailing characters in t beyond j-1. But since we loop up to j-1, those are ignored. So that's okay.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle it correctly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling of the input string: If the input string is longer than 100000 characters. To handle that, perhaps use a larger size for s. But in practice, programming contest problems often have constraints on input size. If the problem allows, the code can handle up to 1e5 characters.\n\n- The code uses adjustl(s) to remove leading spaces. But the original Java code uses in.next(), which reads the next token (so any leading whitespace is skipped). So in Fortran, using adjustl(s) is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when reading with read(*, '(a)'), the variable is filled to its length. So if the input is shorter than len(s), the remaining characters are filled with spaces. So using len_trim(s) would get the actual length of the input (ignoring trailing spaces). But after processing, when replacing BC with D, the code may have trailing spaces in t, but the loop is up to j-1, which is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be correct."
