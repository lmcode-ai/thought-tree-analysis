But in Fortran, if we sum from (n/2 +1) to n, which for n=5 is 3 to 5, which would sum the same elements.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first to understand what it's doing.\n\nThe Java code reads an integer n and a string. It checks if all characters in the string are '4' or '7'. If there's any other character, it prints \"NO\". Otherwise, it sums the first half of the digits and the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nFirst, I'll need to replicate the input reading in Fortran. In Java, they use Scanner to get n and the string. In Fortran, I'll use READ statements. But Fortran needs to read from standard input, so I'll have variables for n and the string.\n\nThe string in Java is converted to a character array. In Fortran, strings are handled as character arrays, so maybe I can just process them directly. Let's see. The Java code checks each character in the array to see if it's not '4' or '7', setting a flag t to 1 if any invalid character is found. In Fortran, I can loop through each character in the string and check if they are '4' or '7'. If any isn't, set a flag, say, t = 1.\n\nThen, if t is 1, output \"NO\". Else, compute the sums of the first half and the second half. For even n, the first half is 1 to n/2, and the second is n/2+1 to n. Wait, in the Java code, the first loop is from 0 to n/2 - 1 (since i < n/2). Then the second loop starts from n-1 (the last index) and goes down to (n/2) -1? Wait, no. Let me check the Java code again:\n\nIn the else part, the first loop is for (i=0; i < n/2; i++) => first half (if n is even, then first n/2 elements). The second loop is for (i = n-1; i > (n/2) -1; i--). Wait, when n is even, n/2 is half. So (n/2) -1 would be (half) -1. The loop starts at i =n-1 (last element) and goes down to (n/2 -1). Let's see for even n=4. Then n/2 is 2. The loop runs from i=3 (since n-1=3) down to (2-1)=1. Wait, but the condition is i > (n/2)-1. So for even n=4, the loop runs for i=3, then i=2 (since when i=2, is it > (2-1)=1? Yes. Then i=2 is included. So for n=4, the loop runs i=3 and 2. So indexes 3 and 2 (which are the third and fourth elements, since Java is 0-based). Wait, this seems like the second half. Wait, for n=4, the first half is indices 0 and 1. The second half would be 2 and 3. But in Java code, the second loop starts at n-1 (3) and goes down to (n/2) -1. Wait, n/2 is 2 here, so (n/2)-1 is 1. So the condition is i>1. So when i=3, it's >1, so run. Then i=2, which is still >1. Then i=1, which is not. So for n=4, the second loop runs i=3 and 2, which are the second half (indices 2 and 3 in Java). Oh right, because in Java, the indices for n=4 are 0,1,2,3. The first half is 0 and 1 (n/2 = 2 elements). The second half is 2 and 3. So in the Java code, the second loop sums those.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop is from i =n-1 downto (n/2) -1. Wait, let's see for n=6. n/2 is 3. (n/2)-1 is 2. So the loop runs i from 5 downto >2. So i=5,4,3. Which are the last three elements (indices 3,4,5) if n is even. So the second loop is summing the second half of the array. So for even n, the first half is 0 to n/2 -1, the second half is n/2 to n-1. Wait, but the loop starts at n-1 and goes downto n/2. Because when i is n-1, n-2,... until i is greater than (n/2)-1. Wait, for even n=4, (n/2)-1 is 1. So the loop runs when i>1. So i=3, 2. Which are the third and fourth elements (indices 2 and 3). So sum is elements 2 and 3, which is the second half.\n\nSo the code sums the first n/2 digits and the last n/2 digits.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are 1-based. So when processing, for a string of length n, the first half is 1 to n/2. The second half is (n/2 +1) to n.\n\nWait, for even n, yes. For example, n=4: first two characters (1-2) and last two (3-4). For odd n, like n=5, then n/2 in Java is 2 (since integer division). So first loop runs 0-1 (two elements), and the second loop runs from 4 downto (2-1) =1. So i>1. So i=4,3,2. Which are indices 4,3,2 (third, fourth, fifth elements in 0-based). So for n=5, the first half is 2 elements, the second half is 3 elements. Wait, but that would make the sum of first half and second half have different numbers of elements, which would make the sum comparison invalid. But the problem statement may assume that n is even. Because otherwise, the code's logic is flawed. Let me check the problem statement. Oh, the problem is codeforces 146 A. Let me recall: the problem is about a ticket being \"lucky\" if it has only 4s and 7s, and the sum of the first half equals the sum of the second half. So n can be even or odd? Wait, no, in the problem statement, it's specified that the ticket is a string of even length. Wait, but the code doesn't check that. The original Java code allows n to be any integer, but if the code is for a problem where n is even, perhaps the problem ensures that. But looking at the code, in the Java code, when n is even or odd, the code still proceeds. For example, if n is 5, then the first loop sums 0 to 1 (two elements), the second loop sums 4,3,2 (three elements). So the sums would be of different lengths. But in the problem statement, perhaps n is even. But the code doesn't check that. So in Fortran code, perhaps we can proceed as in Java.\n\nSo when translating to Fortran, perhaps the same approach is used, but since Fortran is 1-based, the indices will be adjusted.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, read n and the string. In Java, next() reads the next token. So the input is n, then a string (without spaces). In Fortran, we can read using:\n\nread(*,*) n\nread(*,'(A)') str\n\nBut need to make sure that the string is exactly length n. So perhaps declare the string as a variable of length, say, 100 (assuming n is up to 100). But in the Java code, the input string is read as str = in.next(), which would take the next token (so no spaces). So in Fortran, the code can read the entire line, but perhaps using a format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps read the string as a single token, but in Fortran, when you read with '(A)', it will read the entire line, including leading spaces, which may not be desired. So perhaps use a formatted read, but maybe the problem input ensures that the string has exactly n characters.\n\nAssuming that the input is correct, the code can proceed.\n\nSo, variables in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, x, y, t, i\ncharacter(len=100) :: str\nlogical :: valid\n\nBut perhaps, first, read n and the string. Then check each character in the string.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nchar l[] = str.toCharArray();\nfor each i from 0 to n-1:\n   if l[i] is not '4' and not '7', set t=1.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nt = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n   if (str(i:i) /= '4' .and. str(i:i) /= '7') then\n       t = 1\n   end if\nend do\n\nThen, if t ==1, print 'NO'.\n\nElse, compute x as sum of first half, y as sum of second half.\n\nIn Java, the first loop is from 0 to n/2-1. For n even, n/2 elements. For example, if n=4: i=0,1 (n/2=2). For n=5, n/2=2, so i=0,1 (two elements).\n\nThe second loop in Java is from n-1 downto (n/2). For n even, like 4: n/2 is 2. So i runs from 3 downto 2. So elements 2 and 3. For n=5: n/2 is 2. So (n/2) -1 =1. So the loop runs i from 4 downto >1. So i=4,3,2. Elements 2,3,4 (0-based) which are 3 elements. So for odd n, the code is summing a different number of elements. But maybe the problem expects n to be even. However, the original code allows any n. So we need to replicate that.\n\nIn Fortran, for the first loop (sum x), for i from 1 to (n/2). Because in Java, the loop runs for i <n/2. So for n=4, it's 0,1 (two elements) which is 1 to 2 in Fortran (assuming n/2=2). Wait, for n=4, n/2 is 2. So in Java loop runs for i <2, i=0,1 (elements 0 and 1). In Fortran, if we loop from 1 to 2 (since 1-based), that's correct. Similarly, for n=5, n/2 is 2 (since integer division in Java). So the Java loop runs i=0,1 (elements 0 and 1). In Fortran, n/2 is 2.5 but integer division in Fortran would be 2 (since integer division truncates). So for n=5, the first loop in Fortran would be from 1 to 2, which is correct.\n\nSo x is sum of the first n/2 characters.\n\nFor the second loop, in Java it's from i =n-1 downto (n/2). So for n=4, it's 3 downto 2 (elements 3 and 2). In Fortran, the indices would be 4 and 3. So for the second half, in Fortran, we need to loop from (n/2 +1) to n. For n=4, that's 3 and 4. Wait, no. Wait, in Java, the code sums elements 2 and 3 (indices 2 and 3, which are the third and fourth elements). In Fortran, the string is 1-based, so for n=4, the first two elements (1 and 2) are first half, elements 3 and 4 are the second half. But the Java code for n=4 is summing the second half (elements 2 and 3 in 0-based), which are characters 3 and 4 in 1-based. So in Fortran, to get the second half, when n is even, the code would sum from (n/2 +1) to n. For example, n=4: 3 and 4. So sum those.\n\nBut in the Java code, for even n, the second loop is summing the second half. For example, n=4, the code's second loop runs i=3 and 2. So elements 3 (0-based) is the fourth character (1-based) and 2 (0-based) is third character. So in Java, for even n, the code is summing the second half, but in reverse order. But since addition is commutative, the order doesn't matter.\n\nSo for Fortran, the code can sum the second half from (n/2 +1) to n.\n\nBut wait, what if n is even or odd? For even n, yes. For odd n, for example n=5. The first half is 2 elements (1 and 2), the second half is 3 elements (3,4,5). But in Java code, the first loop for n=5 would sum elements 0 and 1 (2 elements), and the second loop would sum elements 4,3,2 (three elements). So in Fortran, for n=5, the code would sum 1-2 (first half) and 3-5 (second half). Wait, but in Java, for n=5, the second loop runs i=4,3,2 (0-based), which are elements 4,3,2. In 1-based, that's 5,4,3. So the sum is 5+4+3. But in Fortran, if we sum 3-5, that's 3+4+5, which is different. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for the second half, the loop starts from the end and goes down to the middle. So for n=5, the code is summing elements 2,3,4 (0-based). Which in 1-based is 3,4,5. So in Java, the sum is (element 2) + (3) + (4). Which in 1-based is 3,4,5. But in Fortran, if we sum from (n/2 +1) to n, which for n=5 is 3 to 5, which would sum the same elements. So for odd n, the code's second loop in Java is summing the same elements as (n/2 +1) to n in Fortran. Wait, n=5: Java's code sums elements 2,3,4 (0-based) which is 3,4,5 in 1-based. So in Fortran, summing from 3 to 5 would get the same digits. So perhaps in Fortran, regardless of even or odd, the code can sum the first n/2 characters and the last n/2 characters. Wait, but for odd n, n/2 would be 2 (since 5/2=2.5, integer division in Java gives 2). So the first half is 2 elements, the second half is 3 elements. So the sum could be different. But according to the original code's logic, it's allowed. So the Fortran code can replicate that.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nsum x from 1 to n/2.\n\nsum y from (n/2 +1) to n.\n\nWait, no. Because for even n, n/2 is exactly half. So for n=4, first half is 1-2, second is 3-4. For n=5, first half is 1-2 (n/2=2), second is 3-5 (3 elements). But in Java, for n=5, the code's second loop sums 3 elements (indices 2,3,4 in Java). So in Fortran, for n=5, the second half is from (n/2 +1) =3 to n=5. So the code would sum those three elements. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the first sum (x), loop from 1 to n/2. For the second sum (y), loop from (n/2 +1) to n.\n\nThus, the code can compute x and y as such.\n\nNow, converting the code step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Java, x and y are initialized to 0, t to 0. Then read n and the string. Then check each character.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nprogram codeforces_146_A\nimplicit none\ninteger :: n, x, y, t, i\ncharacter(len=100) :: str\n\nread(*,*) n\nread(*,'(A)') str\n\nt = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n    if (str(i:i) /= '4' .and. str(i:i) /= '7') then\n        t = 1\n    end if\nend do\n\nif (t == 1) then\n    print *, 'NO'\nelse\n    x = 0\n    y = 0\n    do i = 1, n/2\n        x = x + iachar(str(i:i)) - iachar('0')\n    end do\n    do i = n/2 + 1, n\n        y = y + iachar(str(i:i)) - iachar('0')\n    end do\n    if (x == y) then\n        print *, 'YES'\n    else\n        print *, 'NO'\n    end if\nend if\n\nend program codeforces_146_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when reading a string, the input may have leading or trailing spaces. So when reading str, perhaps read the entire line. For example, if the input is \"4 4738\", but in Fortran, the second read statement may take the entire line. Wait, the first read is for n, the second for str. So in Fortran, the input should be:\n\nn is read first, then the string is read as the next line. So for example:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n4477\n\nThen, the code would read n=4 and str(1:4) as '4477'. But if the input has leading spaces in the string, it would be part of the string. But according to the problem statement, the input is a string of digits. So the code should read exactly n characters. But if the user inputs more or less, it would be a problem. But assuming that the input is correct as per the problem statement.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read a character variable with '(A)', it will read the entire line, including leading spaces. So, for example, if the string is \"4477\" and the input is after n, then the second read would read the entire line as the string. But in the code, the loop runs from 1 to n. So the string must be at least n characters. So perhaps in the code, the string is declared as len=100 (as above), and the code assumes that the input has exactly n characters. So any trailing characters after the first n characters are ignored. But if the input string is shorter than n, then the code will have problems. However, per problem statement, the input should be correct.\n\nSo the code will proceed.\n\nAnother point: converting the character to its numeric value. In Java, Character.getNumericValue(l[i]). For example, '4' becomes 4. In Fortran, we can do this by taking the ASCII value. Since '0' is ASCII 48, then '4' is 52. So 52-48=4. So for a character c, the numeric value is iachar(c) - iachar('0'). So str(i:i) gives the character, and we subtract '0' to get the integer.\n\nThus, the code for x and y in Fortran uses that conversion.\n\nPutting it all together, the Fortran code would be as follows.\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, for the second sum, the loop runs from n-1 downto (n/2 -1). For even n, this includes the second half. For odd n, it includes more elements. But in the Fortran code as written, for the second loop, we are summing from (n/2 +1) to n. For even n, this is correct. For odd n, this gives the second half as (n/2+1) to n. For example, n=5: n/2 is 2 (since integer division), so (n/2 +1) =3. So sum from 3 to 5. Which is correct. The Java code for n=5 sums elements 2,3,4 (0-based) which is 3,4,5 in 1-based. Which is what the Fortran code does.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n4\n4774\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nCheck all characters are 4 or7: yes.\n\nsum first two: 4+7=11.\n\nsum last two:7+4=11. So output YES.\n\nFortran code would do the same.\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\n4477\n\nsum first two:4+4=8, sum last two:7+7=14 \u2192 output NO.\n\nAnother test case where n is odd:\n\nn=5, str=44477 (assuming the problem allows, even though problem may expect even n). Then first two digits (44) sum to 8. Last three digits (4,7,7) sum to 18. So output NO.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, it's allowed.\n\nSo the code should handle it.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when n is read, and the string is read as a line, the string's length may be longer than n, but the code only checks the first n characters. So for example, if n=3 and the string is \"4444\", the code will check the first 3 characters (all 4's), and sum the first 1 (n/2=1) and the next 2 (n/2 +1=2 to 3). So sum first 1:4, sum next two:4+4=8 \u2192 not equal. So output NO.\n\nThus, the code should work as intended."
