    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing.\n\nThe Java code reads an integer n, then two lines of space-separated integers representing v and c lists. It calculates the maximum profit by summing up the positive differences between corresponding elements in v and c. So for each i from 0 to n-1, if v[i] - c[i] is positive, add it to the total max.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, I'll need to read inputs. Java uses Scanner, but Fortran reads from standard input with READ statements. Let's see: the first input is n. Then two lines for v and c.\n\nIn Java, the str2List function splits the string into a map with keys as indices. But in Fortran, arrays are easier. So instead of using a map, we'll use arrays for v and c.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read integer n.\n2. Read the next line as v array with n elements.\n3. Read the next line as c array with n elements.\n4. Initialize max to 0.\n5. Loop from i=1 to n (since Fortran arrays start at 1 by default), calculate profit = v(i) - c(i). If profit >0, add to max.\n6. Print max.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the indices can start at 1, but when reading the input, the Java code uses 0-based. But in the loop, the Java code uses i from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, if the arrays are 1-based, the loop will be from 1 to n.\n\nBut how to read the arrays? The input lines are space-separated numbers. So in Fortran, for reading the arrays, we can read them as a list.\n\nSo for reading n: read *, n.\n\nThen, read the next line as v array. But Fortran can read a line of numbers into an array with the right format. For example, if n is 3, then the input line would be three numbers. So:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: v(:), c(:)\nread *, n\nallocate(v(n), c(n))\nread *, v\nread *, c\n\nThat should work. Then, loop from i=1 to n, compute each profit.\n\nSo the Fortran code would look something like this:\n\nprogram ABC125B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, profit, max\n    integer, allocatable :: v(:), c(:)\n    \n    read *, n\n    allocate(v(n), c(n))\n    read *, v\n    read *, c\n    \n    max = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        profit = v(i) - c(i)\n        if (profit > 0) then\n            max = max + profit\n        end if\n    end do\n    print *, max\nend program ABC125B\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variable names can't be the same as intrinsic functions. Oh right, 'max' is a function name. So using 'max' as a variable might cause issues. So I should rename it to something else, like 'total' to avoid conflict.\n\nYes, that's a problem. So change 'max' to 'total' in the code.\n\nSo the revised code:\n\nprogram ABC125B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, profit, total\n    integer, allocatable :: v(:), c(:)\n    \n    read *, n\n    allocate(v(n), c(n))\n    read *, v\n    read *, c\n    \n    total = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        profit = v(i) - c(i)\n        if (profit > 0) then\n            total = total + profit\n        end if\n    end do\n    print *, total\nend program ABC125B\n\nThat should work. Let me check if there are other differences. The Java code uses 0-based indices for the maps, but in Fortran, the arrays are 1-based. So when processing the elements, the loop from 1 to n in Fortran is correct, because the Java code loops from 0 to n-1, which is equivalent to n elements. So the array elements in Fortran are accessed with 1-based indices, which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in Java, the variables are Integer objects, but in Fortran, they are integers. But since all values are within integer ranges, that's okay.\n\nTesting with sample input. For example, if input is:\n\n3\n10 2 5\n8 3 4\n\nThe Java code would compute (10-8)=2, (2-3)=-1 (not added), (5-4)=1. Total 3.\n\nIn Fortran code, same result.\n\nYes, so the code should be correct."
