So count becomes 1, add 2. Processing 3: 3%2 !=0. count becomes 2, add 3. Processing 4: 4%2=0. divided=2. set contains 2. So not counted. Total count=2. Which is correct.

But if the element is already in the set, adding it again is allowed (but the set in Java does not store duplicates). So the 'set' in Java is just a way to track elements that have been added, to check for the division condition. But for the first condition (element not divisible by k), even if the element is already in the set, the code increments the count. So the set is not being used to track duplicates in this case. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, no. Let's re-examine the code.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads two integers, n and k. Then it reads an array of n long integers. It sorts the array. Then, it uses a HashSet to keep track of elements. The count is incremented under certain conditions: if the element is not divisible by k, or if dividing by k doesn't produce a value already in the set. Finally, it prints the count.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to handle input in Fortran. Java uses Scanner, but Fortran uses READ statements. The variables n and k: n is an integer, k is a long in Java, so maybe integer in Fortran, but depends on the input size. Let's assume k is an integer, but if the problem expects larger values, maybe use INTEGER*8. But the Java code uses long for k and the array elements, which are 64-bit integers. So in Fortran, we should use INTEGER(KIND=8) for those variables.\n\nNext, the array is sorted. Fortran has built-in sorting functions, but maybe need to sort the array in place. For example, using a subroutine to sort the array.\n\nThe HashSet in Java is used to check existence. In Fortran, there's no built-in set, so I need to simulate this. One approach is to create an array to store the elements of the set, and for each element, check if it's present in the array. But inserting into a dynamic array in Fortran can be tricky. Alternatively, since the array is sorted, perhaps we can process elements in a way that avoids duplicates. Wait, the original Java code adds elements to the set only when certain conditions are met, so maybe the order of processing matters.\n\nLet me look at the logic again. The array is sorted. For each element arr[i], if arr[i] is not divisible by k, increment count and add to the set. If it is divisible by k, check if arr[i]/k is not in the set. If not, increment count and add arr[i] to the set.\n\nSo the set is tracking elements that have been added. The idea is that if an element can be divided by k, and the divided result is already in the set, then we don't count the current element. Otherwise, we do. So this is to avoid counting elements that are multiples of smaller elements in the set.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to represent the set. Since the array is sorted, perhaps we can process elements in a way that allows us to track which elements are in the set efficiently. For example, since the array is sorted, when we process elements in order, maybe once we decide to add an element to the set, all previous elements have been processed, and any future elements that are multiples would check against existing elements.\n\nBut the key is to check for the presence of arr[i]/k in the set. How to do this in Fortran? One approach is to maintain a dynamic list (like an allocatable array) of elements in the set. For each element, check if the divided value exists in the list.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read the array of n elements.\n3. Sort the array.\n4. Initialize a dynamic array (set) to keep track of elements.\n5. Iterate through each element in the sorted array.\n6. For each element, check if it's not divisible by k. If so, check if the element is already in the set (maybe redundant since sorted?), then increment count and add to the set. Wait, no: the Java code adds the element to the set regardless. So for the first condition, if element is not divisible by k, add it to the set and count. For the second condition, if it is divisible, check if arr[i]/k is in the set. If not, add it to the set and count.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (arr[i] % k != 0) {\n        count++;\n        set.add(arr[i]);\n    } else if (!set.contains(arr[i] / k)) {\n        count++;\n        set.add(arr[i]);\n    }\n}\n\nSo for each element in the sorted array, first check if it's not divisible by k. If yes, count and add. Otherwise, check if arr[i]/k is not in the set. If that's true, then count and add.\n\nSo the idea is that if an element is a multiple (k times) of some other element, then we only count it if the smaller element is not present.\n\nBut since the array is sorted, perhaps we can process elements in order such that when checking for arr[i]/k, the possible smaller elements have already been processed.\n\nBut how to represent the set in Fortran? Since we need to check if a value exists in the set, perhaps using a dynamic array and checking each element. However, for large n, this could be slow. But given that the original code uses a HashSet (which is O(1) lookups), in Fortran, the approach would be O(n) for each check, which could be a problem for large n. But given that the original code is from codeforces, perhaps the input size is manageable.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the plan is:\n\n- Declare an allocatable array (say, 'set_elements') to hold the elements.\n- For each element in the sorted array:\n   - Check if the element mod k is not zero. If so:\n      - Check if the element is not already in the set (but how? Since the array is sorted, perhaps duplicates are allowed, but the set only contains unique elements. Wait, in Java, the set automatically handles uniqueness. So adding an element that's already present doesn't change the set. So in Fortran, we need to make sure that when we add elements to 'set_elements', they are unique. But in the Java code, after sorting, it's possible that the array has duplicates, but when processed, the set will have unique values. However, the code as written adds elements to the set regardless of whether they are already present. Wait, no: in Java, the HashSet.add() method returns a boolean indicating if the element was added (i.e., not already present). However, in the code provided, the count is incremented regardless. For example, if an element is already in the set, then in the first condition (arr[i]%k !=0), but if the element is already present in the set, adding it again does nothing. However, the count is incremented. Wait, no. Let's see: suppose the element is not divisible by k. Then, the code increments count and adds it to the set. But if the element was already in the set, adding it again doesn't change the set, but count is still incremented. So in that case, the code would count duplicates in the array even if they are the same element. But wait, the original array may have duplicates. Let's take an example. Suppose the array has [2,2], k=1. Then, since 2%1 !=0, the first 2 is added to the set and count is 1. The second 2 is also processed: 2%1 !=0, so count becomes 2, and the set still has 2. But according to the problem's logic, is that correct? Well, the original code is written that way. So perhaps in the problem's context, duplicates are allowed and are counted each time unless one is a multiple of another via k.\n\nBut perhaps the array is processed in sorted order, and the logic ensures that when a multiple is processed after its divisor, it's not counted. For example, if the array is [2,4], k=2. The sorted array is [2,4]. For 2: 2%2=0. Then check if 1 is in the set (no, because set is empty). So add 2 to the set, count becomes 1. Then for 4: 4%2=0. Check if 2 is in the set (yes). So the code doesn't add 4 to the set. So count remains 1. So the code counts 2, but not 4. Which is correct according to the problem's logic.\n\nBut if the array has duplicates, say [2,2,4], k=2. The first 2 is added (count 1). The second 2: when processed, 2%2=0. Check if 1 is not in the set. Since it's not, add 2 to the set (but it's already there), but count becomes 2. Then 4 is processed, and since 2 is in the set, it's not counted. So total count is 2. But according to the problem's logic, perhaps duplicates should be considered as separate elements. But the problem's original code may have a bug here. But I'm to translate the code as is.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the set needs to allow for elements being added multiple times, but the set's contains() method in Java checks for existence. So in the Fortran code, the 'set_elements' array should contain unique elements, as in the Java code's set. But wait, in the Java code, when you add an element to the set, if it's already present, it's not added again. So the set contains unique elements. So in Fortran, when adding an element to 'set_elements', we need to ensure that we don't add duplicates. Otherwise, the contains check would not work correctly.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, when adding an element to the set, we need to first check if it's already present. If not, add it. So, for example, when processing an element, in the case where arr[i] is not divisible by k, we check if it's already in the set. If not, add it and increment count. Wait, no. Wait the Java code does not check if the element is already in the set in the first condition. For example, in the first condition (arr[i]%k !=0), the code adds the element to the set and increments count, regardless of whether it's already present. But since the set is a hashset, adding it again doesn't change the set. So in this case, the count could be incremented even if the element was already present. Which would be a mistake. Wait, this suggests that the original Java code may have a bug.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose arr[i] is 5, and k is 2. Then 5%2 is 1, so the first condition is true. So count is incremented, and 5 is added to the set. Suppose the same element comes again later (since the array is sorted, maybe duplicates are allowed). Then when processing the second 5, again, 5%2 is 1. So count is incremented again, and the set is added 5 again (but since it's a set, it's not added again). So the count increases by 1 again, leading to a total count of 2, but the set only contains one 5. So according to the problem's logic, is that correct?\n\nThe problem's intention is probably to count elements that are not divisible by k, or if divisible by k, their divided value is not present. But in the case of duplicates, like two 5's and k=2, the code would count both. But according to the problem's logic, perhaps this is not intended. However, the original Java code does this. So the Fortran code should replicate this behavior, even if it's a bug. So the problem is to translate the code as is.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, when the element is not divisible by k, we increment the count and add it to the set. But if the element is already in the set, adding it again is allowed (but the set in Java does not store duplicates). So the 'set' in Java is just a way to track elements that have been added, to check for the division condition. But for the first condition (element not divisible by k), even if the element is already in the set, the code increments the count. So the set is not being used to track duplicates in this case. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, no. Let's re-examine the code.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nif (arr[i] % k != 0) {\n    count++;\n    set.add(arr[i]);\n} else if (!set.contains(arr[i] / k)) {\n    count++;\n    set.add(arr[i]);\n}\n\nSo in the first condition, when arr[i] is not divisible by k, the code increments the count and adds the element to the set, regardless of whether the element was already in the set. So even if the element was added before, the count is incremented again. For example, if the array has two 5's, and k=2, then each 5 will be processed as not divisible by 2, so count becomes 2, and both are added to the set (but set only has one 5). But according to the code, the count is incremented for each occurrence. But this is probably incorrect according to the problem's requirements. However, since the original Java code is written that way, the Fortran code must replicate the same logic.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code:\n\nFor each element in the sorted array:\n\n- If the element is not divisible by k: increment count, add to the set (if not already present).\n- Else, if the element divided by k is not in the set: increment count, add to the set (if not already present).\n\nBut in Java, the set is being added regardless of whether the element is present, but the set is a HashSet, which only holds unique elements. So adding the same element multiple times has no effect. But the count is incremented every time the element is processed and meets either condition. So the Java code's count includes elements even if they are duplicates, but the set only contains unique values. So this is a mistake in the original code. However, the user wants the Fortran code to replicate the Java code's behavior. So in the Fortran code, when processing an element, even if the element is already in the set, if the first condition is met (element not divisible by k), then count is incremented, and the element is added to the set (but if it's already there, no change). The same for the second condition.\n\nBut in Fortran, the 'set_elements' array is supposed to mimic the Java HashSet. So for each element, when the code says to add it to the set, we must check if it's already present. If not, add it. Otherwise, skip adding. But the count is still incremented.\n\nWait, no. The Java code adds the element to the set regardless of whether it's already present. Because the code does:\n\nset.add(arr[i]);\n\nWhich returns a boolean indicating whether the element was added. However, the code doesn't check this. So even if the element is already in the set, the code increments the count. For example, if the array has two elements equal to 5, and k=2, then both elements would cause count to increase by 1 each. But in the set, 5 is added once. However, in the problem's context, perhaps this is incorrect. But the original code does this, so we must replicate it.\n\nBut this suggests that the count is incremented even when elements are duplicates. So the code's logic is to count every element that is either not divisible by k, or divisible but the divided value is not in the set. But for duplicates, this could lead to counting elements that have already been counted. For example, two 5s and k=2 would both be counted, leading to a count of 2, even though both are in the same condition. But according to the code, this is the case.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the count is incremented regardless of whether the element is already present in the set. The set is used only to check the divided value in the second condition. So in the first condition, even if the element is already in the set, the code increments the count. So the set is not used to track if the element has been processed before, but only to track which elements are available for the divided check.\n\nSo in the Fortran code:\n\nFor each element:\n\nif (element mod k != 0) then:\n\n    count = count + 1\n\n    if element is not in set_elements, add it to set_elements.\n\nelse:\n\n    if (element/k is not in set_elements) then:\n\n        count = count + 1\n\n        if element is not in set_elements, add it.\n\n    end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Java, the set is added the element in both cases. For example, in the first condition, the element is added to the set. So even if the element was already in the set, adding it again does nothing, but the count is still incremented. So the Fortran code must add the element to the set regardless of whether it's already there, but in reality, the set should not have duplicates. So the code must first check if the element is present before adding, and if not, add it. Because adding it to the set even if present is not necessary. So in Fortran, when the code says to add an element to the set, we have to check if it's already present, and only add it if not.\n\nBut in Java's code, adding an element to the set that's already present does not change the set, but in the count, it's still incremented. So the count is not based on whether the element is added to the set, but rather on the conditions (element not divisible by k, or element divisible by k and divided value not in set).\n\nThus, in the Fortran code:\n\nFor each element:\n\nCheck if element is not divisible by k. If so:\n\n    increment count.\n\n    check if element is in the set. If not, add it.\n\nelse:\n\n    check if element/k is not in the set. If so:\n\n        increment count.\n\n        check if element is in the set. If not, add it.\n\nSo the count is incremented based on the conditions, and the set is updated only by adding new elements.\n\nThus, the Fortran code needs to:\n\n- For each element in the sorted array:\n\n   if (mod(element, k) /= 0) then\n\n       count = count + 1\n\n       if (element not in set_elements) then\n\n           add to set_elements\n\n       end if\n\n   else\n\n       divided = element / k\n\n       if (divided not in set_elements) then\n\n           count = count +1\n\n           if (element not in set_elements) then\n\n               add to set_elements\n\n           end if\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\nSo the key is to check whether divided is in the set. The element is added to the set only if it meets either condition and is not already present.\n\nSo the steps for Fortran:\n\nImplement a way to check if a value is present in the set_elements array.\n\nIn Fortran, to check for the presence of a value in an array, we can loop through the array elements.\n\nSo for example:\n\nfunction is_in_array(array, value)\n    integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: array(:)\n    integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: value\n    logical :: is_in_array\n    integer :: i\n\n    is_in_array = .false.\n    do i = 1, size(array)\n        if (array(i) == value) then\n            is_in_array = .true.\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\nend function is_in_array\n\nBut this can be inefficient for large arrays, but given the problem's constraints, it may be acceptable.\n\nNow, for the dynamic array (set_elements), we can use an allocatable array, and each time we add an element, we check if it's already present. If not, we append it.\n\nIn Fortran, appending to an array can be done by reallocating and copying.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is sorted, but the set_elements may not be sorted. Wait, the original array is sorted, but the set is a HashSet, which has no order. So the set_elements in Fortran can be stored in any order.\n\nThus, for each element in the sorted array, the code checks the conditions and adds to the set_elements array if necessary.\n\nNow, the steps to write the Fortran code:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: n, k\n\nread(*,*) n, k\n\nWait, but in the Java code, k is a long. So in Fortran, we need to use 8-byte integers. So declare variables as integer(kind=8).\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read correctly. For example, if the input is \"3 2\", then n=3 and k=2.\n\n2. Read the array of n elements.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger(kind=8), allocatable :: arr(:)\n\nallocate(arr(n))\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) arr(i)\nend do\n\n3. Sort the array.\n\nIn Fortran, there's no built-in sort function for integers, but we can implement a simple one. Or use the fact that the array is to be sorted and use the existing code. Alternatively, use an intrinsic function. Wait, Fortran 2003 and later have the intrinsic subroutine 'sort'? No, I think not. So need to implement a sort. For simplicity, let's use a simple bubble sort or use a built-in library. Alternatively, since Java uses Arrays.sort which is a dual-pivot quicksort, but for Fortran, perhaps using the 'quicksort' algorithm.\n\nBut for the purposes of this translation, perhaps using a simple sort. Alternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic 'sort' from some libraries. But since it's not standard, perhaps better to write a simple sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the array is sorted in Java in ascending order, and in Fortran, we can use the same. So perhaps using the 'sort' function from the 'iso_fortran_env' module. Wait, no, standard Fortran does not have a built-in sort. So perhaps write a simple quick sort or use a bubble sort.\n\nBut for code brevity and considering that n could be up to 1e5, bubble sort is O(n^2) and not efficient. But given that the original code is from codeforces, perhaps n can be up to 1e5, and a O(n log n) sort is needed. However, implementing a quicksort or merge sort in Fortran is possible but time-consuming.\n\nWait, but the original code uses Arrays.sort, which for primitives in Java is a tuned quicksort. So for Fortran, we need to sort the array in ascending order.\n\nAlternatively, use a Fortran feature. Let me check.\n\nIn Fortran, you can use the intrinsic function 'sorted' but no, that's not available. Alternatively, use a library. But for the purposes of this translation, perhaps the user expects us to write a sort.\n\nBut for the sake of time and code length, perhaps use a simple call to a sort subroutine. Let's proceed.\n\nSo, perhaps use a simple selection sort (though inefficient for large n) or use the 'quicksort' algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, since the original code sorts the array, the Fortran code must do the same. Let's write a quick sort subroutine.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think. The user provided code reads n and k, then reads the array, sorts it, and processes it.\n\nSo, the Fortran code must sort the array.\n\nImplementing a quick sort in Fortran:\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\nrecursive subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n    integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n    integer :: pivot_idx\n\n    if (low < high) then\n        pivot_idx = partition(arr, low, high)\n        call quicksort(arr, low, pivot_idx - 1)\n        call quicksort(arr, pivot_idx + 1, high)\n    end if\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nfunction partition(arr, low, high) result(pivot_idx)\n    integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n    integer(kind=8) :: pivot\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    pivot = arr(high)\n    i = low - 1\n\n    do j = low, high - 1\n        if (arr(j) <= pivot) then\n            i = i + 1\n            call swap(arr(i), arr(j))\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    call swap(arr(i+1), arr(high))\n    pivot_idx = i + 1\nend function partition\n\nsubroutine swap(a, b)\n    integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: a, b\n    integer(kind=8) :: temp\n\n    temp = a\n    a = b\n    b = temp\nend subroutine swap\n\nBut this is a lot of code. But for the purposes of the translation, we need to include it.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran 2008 intrinsic procedure 'sort'. Wait, no, Fortran does not have a built-in sort. So must implement a sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the array is of type integer(kind=8) and use a library. But for code submission, it's better to write the sort code.\n\nSo, the Fortran code will include a quick sort implementation.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'order' function and the 'pack' intrinsic. But that's more complex.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps proceed with writing the quicksort.\n\nNow, after sorting the array, the code processes each element.\n\nNext, the code initializes a set (dynamic array) to track elements. In Fortran, this can be an allocatable array:\n\ninteger(kind=8), allocatable :: set_elements(:)\ninteger :: set_size\n\nInitially, allocate set_elements with size 0. Then, as elements are added, reallocate and append.\n\nBut appending in Fortran requires reallocation each time. Alternatively, start with a reasonable initial size and manage it.\n\nBut for simplicity, we can start with an empty array and append elements as needed.\n\nFor each element in arr:\n\nelement = arr(i)\n\nCheck if mod(element, k) is not zero.\n\nIf yes:\n\n   increment count.\n\n   check if element is not in set_elements. If not, append it.\n\nElse:\n\n   divided = element / k\n\n   check if divided is not in set_elements. If not:\n\n       increment count.\n\n       check if element is not in set_elements. If not, append.\n\n   end if\n\nSo, the code structure in Fortran:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: element, divided\ninteger :: i\nlogical :: found\n\ncount = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    element = arr(i)\n    if (mod(element, k) /= 0) then\n        count = count + 1\n        ! Check if element is not in set_elements\n        found = .false.\n        do j = 1, set_size\n            if (set_elements(j) == element) then\n                found = .true.\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (.not. found) then\n            ! Append to set_elements\n            set_size = set_size + 1\n            if (allocated(set_elements)) then\n                set_elements = [set_elements, element]\n            else\n                allocate(set_elements(1))\n                set_elements(1) = element\n            end if\n        end if\n    else\n        divided = element / k\n        found = .false.\n        do j = 1, set_size\n            if (set_elements(j) == divided) then\n                found = .true.\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (.not. found) then\n            count = count + 1\n            ! Check if element is already in set_elements\n            found_element = .false.\n            do j = 1, set_size\n                if (set_elements(j) == element) then\n                    found_element = .true.\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (.not. found_element) then\n                set_size = set_size + 1\n                if (allocated(set_elements)) then\n                    set_elements = [set_elements, element]\n                else\n                    allocate(set_elements(1))\n                    set_elements(1) = element\n                end if\n            end if\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic array management can be a bit tricky. Also, appending elements using array concatenation ([set_elements, element]) is possible but can be inefficient for large arrays. However, given that the original Java code uses a HashSet, which is efficient, but the Fortran code will have O(n) lookups and appends, which is O(n^2) time. This may be acceptable for small n, but for large n, this could be slow. But the user's code may not have such constraints.\n\nNow, putting all this together.\n\nAnother thing to note: when dividing element by k in Java, since both are long integers, the division is integer division. So in Fortran, we need to perform integer division. In Fortran, the operator '/' applied to integers performs integer division.\n\nSo in the code, divided = element / k.\n\nBut in Java, if element is negative, the division rounds towards zero. In Fortran, integer division rounds towards the nearest integer, which for negative numbers may differ. However, in the problem's context, perhaps the input is positive, so this may not matter. But to replicate Java's behavior exactly, perhaps need to ensure that division rounds towards zero. But since the original code's problem is not known, but the code is to be translated as is, perhaps we proceed with standard Fortran division.\n\nNow, putting all the pieces together.\n\nThe Fortran code will have:\n\n- Variable declarations.\n- Reading input.\n- Sorting the array.\n- Initializing the set_elements array.\n- Processing each element.\n- Outputting the count.\n\nSo here's the Fortran code:\n\nmodule quicksort_module\ncontains\n    recursive subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n        integer :: pivot_idx\n\n        if (low < high) then\n            pivot_idx = partition(arr, low, high)\n            call quicksort(arr, low, pivot_idx - 1)\n            call quicksort(arr, pivot_idx + 1, high)\n        end if\n    end subroutine quicksort\n\n    function partition(arr, low, high) result(pivot_idx)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n        integer(kind=8) :: pivot\n        integer :: i, j\n\n        pivot = arr(high)\n        i = low - 1\n\n        do j = low, high - 1\n            if (arr(j) <= pivot) then\n                i = i + 1\n                call swap(arr(i), arr(j))\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        call swap(arr(i+1), arr(high))\n        pivot_idx = i + 1\n    end function partition\n\n    subroutine swap(a, b)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: a, b\n        integer(kind=8) :: temp\n\n        temp = a\n        a = b\n        b = temp\n    end subroutine swap\nend module quicksort_module\n\nprogram codeforces_274_A\n    use quicksort_module\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8) :: n, k, count, element, divided\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: arr(:), set_elements(:)\n    integer :: i, j, set_size\n    logical :: found, found_element\n\n    read(*,*) n, k\n    allocate(arr(n))\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) arr(i)\n    end do\n\n    call quicksort(arr, 1, n)\n\n    set_size = 0\n    allocate(set_elements(0))\n\n    count = 0\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        element = arr(i)\n        if (mod(element, k) /= 0) then\n            count = count + 1\n            found = .false.\n            do j = 1, set_size\n                if (set_elements(j) == element) then\n                    found = .true.\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (.not. found) then\n                set_size = set_size + 1\n                if (set_size > size(set_elements)) then\n                    call move_alloc(set_elements, temp)\n                    allocate(set_elements(set_size))\n                    set_elements(1:set_size-1) = temp\n                    set_elements(set_size) = element\n                    deallocate(temp)\n                else\n                    set_elements(set_size) = element\n                end if\n            end if\n        else\n            divided = element / k\n            found = .false.\n            do j = 1, set_size\n                if (set_elements(j) == divided) then\n                    found = .true.\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (.not. found) then\n                count = count + 1\n                found_element = .false.\n                do j = 1, set_size\n                    if (set_elements(j) == element) then\n                        found_element = .true.\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end do\n                if (.not. found_element) then\n                    set_size = set_size + 1\n                    if (set_size > size(set_elements)) then\n                        call move_alloc(set_elements, temp)\n                        allocate(set_elements(set_size))\n                        set_elements(1:set_size-1) = temp\n                        set_elements(set_size) = element\n                        deallocate(temp)\n                    else\n                        set_elements(set_size) = element\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    write(*,*) count\n\nend program codeforces_274_A\n\nWait, but the way the set_elements is allocated and managed may have issues. Initially, set_elements is allocated with size 0. Then, when adding elements, the code checks if set_size is larger than the current allocated size. But this approach uses a static array. Alternatively, using dynamic allocation each time an element is added. But for efficiency, perhaps pre-allocate a larger array and manage the size.\n\nAlternatively, use an allocatable array and use the '//' operator to append elements.\n\nBut in the code above, the initial allocation is set_elements(0). Then, when adding an element, if set_size exceeds the size, the code tries to extend the array. However, this code may not be correct. For example, when set_size is 1, and the array is initially size 0, we need to reallocate.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code:\n\ncall move_alloc(set_elements, temp)\nallocate(set_elements(set_size))\nset_elements(1:set_size-1) = temp\nset_elements(set_size) = element\ndeallocate(temp)\n\nThis correctly copies the old elements and appends the new one.\n\nBut in the code above, when set_size is 1, the temp array is size 0. So set_elements(1:0) would be a no-op. Then set_elements(1) = element.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, use the array concatenation method:\n\nset_elements = [set_elements, element]\n\nBut this creates a new array each time, which is inefficient for large set_size.\n\nBut for the purposes of this code, assuming that the input is manageable, this approach is acceptable.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nInstead of manually managing the array with move_alloc, use array concatenation.\n\nSo, the code for adding an element would be:\n\nif (.not. found) then\n    set_elements = [set_elements, element]\n    set_size = set_size + 1\nend if\n\nSimilarly for the other case.\n\nBut in Fortran, this requires that set_elements is allocatable.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nInitially:\n\nallocate(set_elements(0))\n\nThen, when adding an element:\n\nset_elements = [set_elements, element]\n\nBut note that in Fortran, when you have an array of size 0, concatenating with a scalar element is allowed. For example, [integer :: ] is an empty array. [integer :: ] // 5 gives an array of size 1 with 5.\n\nThus, the code can be simplified.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIn the first condition:\n\nif (.not. found) then\n    set_elements = [set_elements, element]\nend if\n\nSimilarly for the other case.\n\nThis way, set_size can be obtained via size(set_elements).\n\nBut to avoid calling size(set_elements) each time, perhaps track set_size as a variable.\n\nBut in the code, after each addition, set_size is incremented.\n\nAlternatively, after each addition, set_size = size(set_elements).\n\nBut in the code, after appending, set_size is set to size(set_elements).\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps track set_size as a variable.\n\nBut in the code, when appending, set_elements is updated, and set_size is set to size(set_elements).\n\nSo the revised code:\n\nmodule quicksort_module\ncontains\n    recursive subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n        integer :: pivot_idx\n\n        if (low < high) then\n            pivot_idx = partition(arr, low, high)\n            call quicksort(arr, low, pivot_idx - 1)\n            call quicksort(arr, pivot_idx + 1, high)\n        end if\n    end subroutine quicksort\n\n    function partition(arr, low, high) result(pivot_idx)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n        integer(kind=8) :: pivot\n        integer :: i, j\n\n        pivot = arr(high)\n        i = low - 1\n\n        do j = low, high - 1\n            if (arr(j) <= pivot) then\n                i = i + 1\n                call swap(arr(i), arr(j))\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        call swap(arr(i+1), arr(high))\n        pivot_idx = i + 1\n    end function partition\n\n    subroutine swap(a, b)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: a, b\n        integer(kind=8) :: temp\n\n        temp = a\n        a = b\n        b = temp\n    end subroutine swap\nend module quicksort_module\n\nprogram codeforces_274_A\n    use quicksort_module\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8) :: n, k, count, element, divided\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: arr(:), set_elements(:)\n    integer :: i, j\n    logical :: found\n\n    read(*,*) n, k\n    allocate(arr(n))\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) arr(i)\n    end do\n\n    call quicksort(arr, 1, n)\n\n    allocate(set_elements(0))\n    count = 0\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        element = arr(i)\n        if (mod(element, k) /= 0) then\n            count = count + 1\n            found = .false.\n            do j = 1, size(set_elements)\n                if (set_elements(j) == element) then\n                    found = .true.\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (.not. found) then\n                set_elements = [set_elements, element]\n            end if\n        else\n            divided = element / k\n            found = .false.\n            do j = 1, size(set_elements)\n                if (set_elements(j) == divided) then\n                    found = .true.\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (.not. found) then\n                count = count + 1\n                found = .false.\n                do j = 1, size(set_elements)\n                    if (set_elements(j) == element) then\n                        found = .true.\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end do\n                if (.not. found) then\n                    set_elements = [set_elements, element]\n                end if\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    write(*,*) count\n\nend program codeforces_274_A\n\nThis code:\n\n- Uses a quicksort to sort the array.\n\n- Initializes set_elements as an empty array.\n\n- For each element, checks the conditions.\n\n- Uses array concatenation to add elements to set_elements.\n\nBut in the case where the element is not divisible by k, we increment count and add it to set_elements if not already present.\n\nSimilarly for the else case.\n\nBut this code has a nested loop for checking presence in set_elements, which is O(n^2) in the worst case. But given that the original code is from a programming competition, this could be a problem for large n. However, the original Java code uses a HashSet which has O(1) lookups. So this code may not be efficient for large inputs. But the user asked for a direct translation, so this is the correct approach.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the quicksort's indices. In the code, the initial call is quicksort(arr, 1, n), assuming that the array is 1-based. But in Fortran, arrays are usually 1-based by default. So if the array is declared as arr(n), indices 1 to n are valid. So the quicksort code should work.\n\nTesting with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 2\n20 4 3 5 1\n\nWait, no. Let me check the problem's sample input.\n\nWait, the user didn't provide sample input, but in codeforces problem 274A, the problem is \"k-Multiple Free Set\". Let me recall that problem.\n\nThe problem is to select the largest subset of numbers such that no two elements are such that one is k times the other. The approach is to sort the array and process each element, adding it to the set if it is not a multiple of a previous element (divided by k).\n\nBut the Java code's logic is correct for that problem.\n\nFor example, sample input 1:\n\nn=3, k=2\n\narray: [2,3,4]\n\nsorted: [2,3,4]\n\nProcessing 2: 2%2=0. divided=1. set is empty. So count becomes 1, add 2.\n\nProcessing 3: 3%2 !=0. count becomes 2, add 3.\n\nProcessing 4: 4%2=0. divided=2. set contains 2. So not counted.\n\nTotal count=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut according to the Java code, for the element 4, divided is 2, which is in the set. So it is not counted.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the same logic is replicated.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code as written should correctly replicate the Java code's functionality."
