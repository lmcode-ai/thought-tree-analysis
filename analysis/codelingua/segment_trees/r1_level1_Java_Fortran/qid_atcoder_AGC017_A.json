So perhaps there's a mathematical formula to replace the loops that compute add. Wait, let's think. The sum of even subsets is 2^{k1-1} when k1 is >=1. So if k1 is 0, then sum of even subsets is 1. So for example, in the case where p is 0, the code is adding all even combinations of the k1 elements. But if k1 is zero, then the sum is 1 (if p is 0, since we choose zero elements, which is even). So this might be a way to avoid calculating the combinations directly. Let's see. For example, when p is 0, the add variable is sum_{i even} C(i, k1). Which is equal to 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1, but when k1 is zero, it's 1. Similarly, for p=1, sum_{i odd} C(i, k1) is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1, else zero. Wait, let's test this with small k1:\n\nk1 = 0: sum even is C(0,0) =1. sum odd is 0. k1=1: sum even is C(0,1) =0 if 0>1? Wait no. Wait the function C(n,m) computes m choose n. So C(0,1) is 1 choose 0 =1. So sum even when k1=1 would be i=0. So add =1. 2^{1-1} is 1. So matches. k1=2: sum even i (0,2). C(0,2)=1, C(2,2)=1. Sum is 2. 2^{2-1}=2. Correct. k1=3: sum even i (0,2). C(0,3)=1, C(2,3)=3. Sum is 4. 2^{3-1}=4. Correct. So yes, the sum is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1, and 1 when k1 is 0. So this is a mathematical shortcut. Then why does the original code compute the sum by looping through all possible i's?",

If that's the case, then the Fortran code can avoid calculating combinations altogether and just compute 2^{k0} multiplied by 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1, etc. But let's check the original code. For example, when p is 0:\n\nans = 2^k0 * sum_{i even} C(i, k1). But sum_{i even} C(i,k1) is 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1. But when k1 is zero, the sum is 1. So the code can be optimized as follows:\n\nif k1 ==0:\n   if p ==0: sum is 1\n   else: sum is 0 (since there are no odd elements)\nelse:\n   sum is 2^{k1-1} when p is 0 or 1, depending on whether the sum is even or odd. Wait, no. The sum for even i is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1, regardless of the value of k1. Similarly, the sum for odd i is also 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1. So when p is 0, add is sum_{i even} C(k1, i) = 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1, else 1. So the code can be rewritten as:\n\nif p ==0:\n   if k1 ==0:\n       add =1\n   else:\n       add = 2^(k1-1)\nelse:\n   if k1 ==0:\n       add =0\n   else:\n       add =2^(k1-1) So this would avoid all the combination calculations and loops. Then the code becomes much simpler. But wait, the original code's approach may have been written that way because perhaps the user wasn't aware of the mathematical formula. But given that the code works correctly, perhaps translating it directly would be better. However, considering that Fortran doesn't have big integers, using exponents might lead to very large numbers, but since in the original code the answer is a product of 2^k0 and 2^{k1-1}, which equals 2^{k0 + k1 -1} when applicable. But when k1 is zero and p is zero, it's 2^k0 *1. But in Java, the code uses BigInteger to handle these large exponents.",

So in Fortran, we need to compute the product of 2^k0 multiplied by 2^{k1-1} (or similar), but how? But wait, the original code computes ans as 2^k0 multiplied by the sum. So the sum is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1, and 1 when k1=0 and p=0. So ans would be 2^{k0} * sum. But let's see:\n\nIf sum is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1 and p is 0, then ans is 2^{k0} * 2^{k1-1} = 2^{k0 +k1 -1} = 2^{n -1} since k0 +k1 =n. \n\nWait, because in the input, there are n numbers, so k0 +k1 =n. So 2^{n-1} when p=0 and k1>=1. If p=0 and k1=0, then ans is 2^{k0} *1 =2^{k0} =2^n (since k0 =n). Similarly, if p=1, then sum is 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1, else 0. So ans is 2^{k0} *2^{k1-1} =2^{n-1} if k1 >=1. Otherwise, 0. But what if k1 is zero and p is 1? Then sum is zero, so ans is zero. But this seems to suggest that the answer depends on whether k1 is zero or not. So the final answer is:\n\nif p ==0: if k1 ==0:\n\n       ans = 2^k0\n\n   else:\n\n       ans = 2^{n-1}\n\nelse (p==1):\n\n   if k1 ==0:\n\n       ans =0\n\n   else:\n\n       ans= 2^{n-1}\n\nBut wait, is this correct?\n\nLet me test some examples. Example 1:\n\nInput n=2, p=0. Numbers are both even: k0=2, k1=0. Then ans= 2^2 *1 =4. According to the formula, since p=0 and k1=0, ans is 2^2=4. Correct. Example 2:\n\nn=2, p=0.",

So ans= 2^0 *2=2. According to formula, n=2, k1=2>=1, so ans=2^{2-1} =2. Correct. Another example: n=3, p=1. Numbers are all odd. k1=3. sum odd i's (1,3). C(1,3)=3, C(3,3)=1. Sum is4. ans=2^0 *4=4. According to formula, ans=2^{3-1}=4. Correct. So the formula holds.

But in the case where k1=0 and p is 0, ans is 2^k0. So this is a much simpler approach and avoids big integers because 2^60 is manageable as a 64-bit integer. But what if n is up to 1e5? Then 2^{n-1} would be way larger than 64-bit integers. So for n=1e5, 2^1e5 is a number with over 30,000 digits.",

But for larger exponents, it's not possible. So if n can be up to 1e5, then 2^{1e5} is way beyond standard data types. But the original Java code uses BigIntegers, which can handle this. So how to translate that to Fortran? Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved with the formula ans = 2^{n-1} when k1 >=1 and p is 0 or 1. But only when k1 is not zero and the sum is 2^{k1-1}. Wait, but when k1 >=1, the sum for even i and sum for odd i are both 2^{k1-1}, so regardless of p being 0 or 1 (but only if k1 >=1), the answer is 2^{n-1}. Wait, no. Because when p is 0, the sum is the even i's, which is 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1, and when p is 1, the sum is the odd i's, which is also 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1. So regardless of p, as long as k1 >=1, the sum is 2^{k1-1}. So the ans is 2^{k0} * 2^{k1-1} = 2^{k0 +k1 -1} = 2^{n-1} because k0 +k1 =n. So regardless of p being 0 or 1, as long as k1 >=1, the answer is 2^{n-1}. Only when k1 is zero, the answer depends on p: if p is 0, it's 2^{k0} =2^{n}, else 0. So this is a huge simplification. So the code can be written as:\n\nif p == 0:\n\n   if k1 ==0:\n\n       ans = 2**n\n\n   else:\n\n       ans = 2**(n-1)\n\nelse:\n\n   if k1 ==0:\n\n       ans =0\n\n   else:\n\n       ans =2**(n-1) So this code would handle all cases. But how to compute 2**n when n can be up to a large number, say 1e5? In Fortran, using integer types would overflow even for n=30. So the code would need to output the result as a string of digits, which is complicated. But the original code uses BigIntegers, implying that the answer can be arbitrarily large. So in Fortran, without big integers, this is a problem.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program calculates a combinatorial problem. It reads integers n and p, then reads n integers. It counts how many of those are even (k0) and odd (k1). The answer is computed based on whether p is 0 or 1. \n\nThe main part is calculating combinations. The Java code uses BigInteger for handling large numbers, which is important because factorials can get really big. The C function computes combinations, like n choose m. Wait, no, looking at the parameters: in Java, C is called with (i, k1), so it's C(i, k1) which would be k1 choose i? Wait, wait. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n!/(k! (n-k)! ), but in the Java code, the function C is named as C(n, m), but the code seems to compute m choose n. Because in the loops, the first loop multiplies from m - n + 1 to m, which is m*(m-1)*...*(m-n+1) which is m!/(m-n)! , then divides by n! So the result is m!/(n! (m-n)! ), which is equivalent to m choose n. So the function C(n, m) computes m choose n. So when they call C(i, k1), that's k1 choose i.\n\nIn Fortran, handling big integers is a bit tricky because Fortran doesn't have built-in arbitrary precision integers like Java's BigInteger. Oh right, so I need to find a way to compute combinations without using big integers. Wait, but the problem is that the numbers can be large, so maybe the original Java code uses BigInteger to avoid overflow. Translating this directly to Fortran could be problematic if the numbers are too big for standard integer types. But perhaps the constraints of the problem allow for using integers, but I'm not sure. Wait, the original code is for programming contest problem AGC017 A. Let me think about possible inputs. For example, if n is up to 1e5 or something, but the code uses k1 which can be up to n, which could be up to maybe 1e5. But calculating combinations for such numbers with big integers might not be feasible. However, the code here is for when the problem requires big integers, so we need to replicate that in Fortran. But Fortran doesn't have a built-in arbitrary precision library. Hmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code uses combinations for a small i. For example, when p is 0 or 1, the loops for adding are over even or odd i's. For example, in the case of p=0, the code loops i from 0 to k1 in steps of 2, so i can be up to k1. But for each i, C(i, k1) is the combination. So the sum is the sum of combinations of choosing an even number of elements from k1 elements. Which is equal to 2^{k1-1} when k1>0. Wait, is there a mathematical shortcut here? Because calculating combinations directly could be time-consuming for large k1, but maybe in the original problem, the constraints are small enough. But the code uses Java's BigInteger to avoid overflow, so in Fortran, we need to handle large integers as well. \n\nBut Fortran doesn't have arbitrary precision. So unless there's a library or a way to handle big integers, this might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem can be solved using another approach that avoids big integers. Let me think. The Java code computes the number of ways as ans = 2^{k0} * sum_{i even or odd} (k1 choose i). \n\nBut sum_{i even} (k1 choose i) is 2^{k1-1} if k1 >0. Similarly for odd. Wait, if k1 is the number of odd elements, then the sum of even subsets is 2^{k1-1}, provided that k1 is at least 1. Otherwise, when k1 is 0, sum even is 1. Similarly, the sum of odd subsets is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1. So perhaps there's a mathematical formula to replace the loops that compute add. \n\nWait, let's think. The sum of even subsets is 2^{k1-1} when k1 is >=1. So if k1 is 0, then sum of even subsets is 1. So for example, in the case where p is 0, the code is adding all even combinations of the k1 elements. But if k1 is zero, then the sum is 1 (if p is 0, since we choose zero elements, which is even). \n\nSo this might be a way to avoid calculating the combinations directly. Let's see. For example, when p is 0, the add variable is sum_{i even} C(i, k1). Which is equal to 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1, but when k1 is zero, it's 1. Similarly, for p=1, sum_{i odd} C(i, k1) is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1, else zero. \n\nWait, let's test this with small k1:\n\nk1 = 0: sum even is C(0,0) =1. sum odd is 0.\n\nk1=1: sum even is C(0,1) =0 if 0>1? Wait no. Wait the function C(n,m) computes m choose n. So C(0,1) is 1 choose 0 =1. So sum even when k1=1 would be i=0. So add =1. 2^{1-1} is 1. So matches. \n\nk1=2: sum even i (0,2). C(0,2)=1, C(2,2)=1. Sum is 2. 2^{2-1}=2. Correct. \n\nk1=3: sum even i (0,2). C(0,3)=1, C(2,3)=3. Sum is 4. 2^{3-1}=4. Correct. \n\nSo yes, the sum is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1, and 1 when k1 is 0. \n\nSo this is a mathematical shortcut. Then why does the original code compute the sum by looping through all possible i's? Maybe because the original problem had different constraints, but perhaps in this case, using this formula can simplify the code. \n\nIf that's the case, then the Fortran code can avoid calculating combinations altogether and just compute 2^{k0} multiplied by 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1, etc. But let's check the original code. For example, when p is 0:\n\nans = 2^k0 * sum_{i even} C(i, k1). \n\nBut sum_{i even} C(i,k1) is 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1. But when k1 is zero, the sum is 1. So the code can be optimized as follows:\n\nif k1 ==0:\n   if p ==0: sum is 1\n   else: sum is 0 (since there are no odd elements)\nelse:\n   sum is 2^{k1-1} when p is 0 or 1, depending on whether the sum is even or odd. \n\nWait, no. The sum for even i is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1, regardless of the value of k1. Similarly, the sum for odd i is also 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1. \n\nSo when p is 0, add is sum_{i even} C(k1, i) = 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1, else 1. \n\nSo the code can be rewritten as:\n\nif p ==0:\n   if k1 ==0:\n       add =1\n   else:\n       add = 2^(k1-1)\nelse:\n   if k1 ==0:\n       add =0\n   else:\n       add =2^(k1-1)\n\nSo this would avoid all the combination calculations and loops. Then the code becomes much simpler. \n\nBut wait, the original code's approach may have been written that way because perhaps the user wasn't aware of the mathematical formula. But given that the code works correctly, perhaps translating it directly would be better. However, considering that Fortran doesn't have big integers, using exponents might lead to very large numbers, but since in the original code the answer is a product of 2^k0 and 2^{k1-1}, which equals 2^{k0 + k1 -1} when applicable. But when k1 is zero and p is zero, it's 2^k0 *1. \n\nBut in Java, the code uses BigInteger to handle these large exponents. In Fortran, unless we can handle very large integers, which isn't possible with standard types, but perhaps the problem's constraints allow for exponents up to say 1e5, which would require using a big integer library. However, Fortran doesn't have such a library built-in. So this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the output to be printed in full, even if it's a very large number. So in Fortran, we need to compute the product of 2^k0 multiplied by 2^{k1-1} (or similar), but how? \n\nBut wait, the original code computes ans as 2^k0 multiplied by the sum. So the sum is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1, and 1 when k1=0 and p=0. So ans would be 2^{k0} * sum. \n\nBut let's see:\n\nIf sum is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1 and p is 0, then ans is 2^{k0} * 2^{k1-1} = 2^{k0 +k1 -1} = 2^{n -1} since k0 +k1 =n. \n\nWait, because in the input, there are n numbers, so k0 +k1 =n. So 2^{n-1} when p=0 and k1>=1. If p=0 and k1=0, then ans is 2^{k0} *1 =2^{k0} =2^n (since k0 =n). \n\nSimilarly, if p=1, then sum is 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1, else 0. So ans is 2^{k0} *2^{k1-1} =2^{n-1} if k1 >=1. Otherwise, 0. \n\nBut what if k1 is zero and p is 1? Then sum is zero, so ans is zero. \n\nBut this seems to suggest that the answer depends on whether k1 is zero or not. \n\nSo the final answer is:\n\nif p ==0:\n\n   if k1 ==0:\n\n       ans = 2^k0\n\n   else:\n\n       ans = 2^{n-1}\n\nelse (p==1):\n\n   if k1 ==0:\n\n       ans =0\n\n   else:\n\n       ans= 2^{n-1}\n\nBut wait, is this correct?\n\nLet me test some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput n=2, p=0.\n\nNumbers are both even: k0=2, k1=0.\n\nThen ans= 2^2 *1 =4. According to the formula, since p=0 and k1=0, ans is 2^2=4. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nn=2, p=0. Numbers are 1 (odd) and 1 (odd). k0=0, k1=2. sum even i: i=0 and 2.\n\nC(0,2) =1, C(2,2)=1. Sum is 2. So ans= 2^0 *2=2. According to formula, n=2, k1=2>=1, so ans=2^{2-1} =2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, p=1. Numbers are all odd. k1=3. sum odd i's (1,3). C(1,3)=3, C(3,3)=1. Sum is4. ans=2^0 *4=4. According to formula, ans=2^{3-1}=4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula holds. So the code can be simplified to:\n\nif p is 0:\n\n   if k1 is 0:\n\n       ans = 2^k0\n\n   else:\n\n       ans = 2^{n-1}\n\nelse:\n\n   if k1 is 0:\n\n       ans=0\n\n   else:\n\n       ans=2^{n-1}\n\nBut wait, this is only true if the sum is 2^{k1-1} when k1 >=1. But in the case where k1=0 and p is 0, ans is 2^k0. \n\nSo this is a much simpler approach and avoids big integers because 2^60 is manageable as a 64-bit integer. But what if n is up to 1e5? Then 2^{n-1} would be way larger than 64-bit integers. So for n=1e5, 2^1e5 is a number with over 30,000 digits. The original code uses BigIntegers, so the correct answer must be output as a precise big integer. \n\nBut Fortran doesn't have built-in big integers, so this approach would fail for large n. However, the problem's original code uses BigIntegers, so translating to Fortran would require a way to handle very large exponents. But Fortran isn't equipped for that. \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the problem expects the output to be a big integer, and thus the original Java code uses BigIntegers. Therefore, translating to Fortran would require implementing big integer arithmetic, which is not trivial. \n\nBut given that the user is asking to translate the code to Fortran, maybe they are aware of some way to handle this. Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written using the mathematical formula, but then the answer would be a very large number that can't be stored in standard Fortran types. \n\nBut perhaps the original problem has constraints that n is small, but that's not stated. \n\nSo the original code computes combinations using loops, which works even for large k1. But how does this affect the Fortran code? \n\nHmm. Let's think again. The original code's approach is to compute the combinations for each i (even or odd) and sum them up, then multiply by 2^k0. \n\nBut in Fortran, without big integers, we can't compute this for large k1. \n\nBut perhaps the user wants a direct translation, assuming that the inputs are small enough that the product fits into a 64-bit integer. But that's not safe. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be from a programming contest where the answer can be output as a string, and Fortran can handle big integers via arrays or strings. But implementing that is complex. \n\nGiven the original code's approach, perhaps the correct way is to translate it to Fortran using arbitrary-precision libraries, but Fortran doesn't have such built-in. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written using the mathematical formula, which simplifies the problem. But then the code becomes much simpler and handles all cases. \n\nBut let's check: when k1 is even or odd, the sum is 2^{k1-1} (if k1 >=1). So the answer is 2^{k0} * (2^{k1-1}) if k1 >=1 and p is 0 or 1. Otherwise, when k1 is zero, it's 2^{k0} (if p=0) or 0 (if p=1). \n\nSo the code can be written as follows in Fortran:\n\nRead n, p.\n\nRead the next n numbers, count k0 and k1.\n\nCompute ans based on the conditions above.\n\nBut how to compute 2^x for large x in Fortran? For exponents up to 1e3, we can compute as integers. But for larger exponents, it's not possible. So if n can be up to 1e5, then 2^{1e5} is way beyond standard data types. \n\nBut the original Java code uses BigIntegers, which can handle this. So how to translate that to Fortran? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved with the formula ans = 2^{n-1} when k1 >=1 and p is 0 or 1. But only when k1 is not zero and the sum is 2^{k1-1}.\n\nWait, but when k1 >=1, the sum for even i and sum for odd i are both 2^{k1-1}, so regardless of p being 0 or 1 (but only if k1 >=1), the answer is 2^{n-1}. \n\nWait, no. Because when p is 0, the sum is the even i's, which is 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1, and when p is 1, the sum is the odd i's, which is also 2^{k1-1} if k1 >=1. So regardless of p, as long as k1 >=1, the sum is 2^{k1-1}. So the ans is 2^{k0} * 2^{k1-1} = 2^{k0 +k1 -1} = 2^{n-1} because k0 +k1 =n. \n\nSo regardless of p being 0 or 1, as long as k1 >=1, the answer is 2^{n-1}. Only when k1 is zero, the answer depends on p: if p is 0, it's 2^{k0} =2^{n}, else 0. \n\nSo this is a huge simplification. So the code can be written as:\n\nif p == 0:\n\n   if k1 ==0:\n\n       ans = 2**n\n\n   else:\n\n       ans = 2**(n-1)\n\nelse:\n\n   if k1 ==0:\n\n       ans =0\n\n   else:\n\n       ans =2**(n-1)\n\nSo this code would handle all cases. But how to compute 2**n when n can be up to a large number, say 1e5? \n\nIn Fortran, using integer types would overflow even for n=30. So the code would need to output the result as a string of digits, which is complicated. But the original code uses BigIntegers, implying that the answer can be arbitrarily large. \n\nSo in Fortran, without big integers, this is a problem. However, perhaps the user expects a translation that follows the same approach as the Java code, even if it's not efficient. \n\nBut given that the original code uses combinations and loops, perhaps the problem expects that. So perhaps the Java code is written that way to handle cases where the mathematical formula is not applicable. Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, the formula should work. So maybe the original code is written in a way that is correct but not optimized, and the mathematical approach is better. \n\nIn any case, the user has asked to translate the Java code to Fortran. So perhaps the code should be translated as is, even if it's not the most efficient. \n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n1. Read n and p.\n\n2. Read n integers, count even and odd (k0 and k1).\n\n3. Compute ans = 2^k0.\n\n4. Depending on p, compute the sum of combinations for even or odd i's, then multiply by ans.\n\nThe challenge is to compute combinations in Fortran, using big integers. \n\nBut Fortran doesn't have a built-in arbitrary precision library, so this would require implementing big integer operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a pre-written Fortran big integer module. But assuming that's not available, perhaps it's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written using integer arrays to represent big integers, but that's complex. \n\nGiven that this is a programming contest problem, perhaps the answer is 0 when there are no odd numbers and p=1, 2^k0 when there are no odds and p=0, and 2^{n-1} otherwise. \n\nSo the code can be written using that logic. Let's test this with the original code's example. \n\nFor example, original code's first case:\n\nInput:\n\nn=2, p=0\n\nnumbers: 1 1 \u2192 k0=0, k1=2.\n\nans = 2^0 * (C(0,2) + C(2,2)) = 1*(1 +1)=2. According to the formula, since k1>=1, ans=2^{2-1}=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, p=1, numbers are 1,1,1. k0=0, k1=3. sum is C(1,3) + C(3,3) =3+1=4. ans=1*4=4. formula gives 2^{3-1}=4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran code can be written using this formula, which avoids combinations altogether and the need for big integers. \n\nBut how to compute 2^(n-1) when n can be up to 1e5? This requires arbitrary-precision exponentiation. \n\nIn Fortran, handling this would require writing a function to compute large exponents and output them as strings. \n\nBut implementing big integer exponentiation is non-trivial. \n\nBut perhaps the user expects this approach, given the code's original logic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem constraints are small enough that standard 64-bit integers can handle the answer, but that's unlikely. \n\nSo the code can be written to use the formula and output the result as a string. \n\nBut how to implement this in Fortran? \n\nWell, I can write a function to compute 2^m and return it as a string. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For ans = 2^{something}, compute that as a string.\n\nImplementing this requires a big integer multiplication function. \n\nSo, for example, to compute 2^m, start with 1 and multiply by 2 m times, using string or array representations. \n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\nImplement a function to multiply a number (represented as a string) by 2. \n\nInitialize the result as '1'.\n\nFor i from 1 to m:\n\n    result = result * 2, implemented via string operations.\n\nThis is manageable. \n\nSo in Fortran, the code would:\n\nRead n, p.\n\nRead the numbers, count k0 and k1.\n\nCompute the exponent based on the conditions.\n\nIf the exponent is negative (which shouldn't happen), output 0.\n\nElse, compute 2^exponent as a string and print it.\n\nSo let's structure the code:\n\nFirst, count k0 and k1.\n\nThen, determine the exponent:\n\nIf p == 0:\n\n   if k1 ==0:\n\n       exponent = k0\n\n   else:\n\n       exponent = n-1\n\nelse:\n\n   if k1 ==0:\n\n       output 0\n\n   else:\n\n       exponent = n-1\n\nSo the code would compute 2^exponent, except when in p=1 and k1=0, output 0.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, p, x, i, k0, k1, exponent\n\n    k0 = 0\n\n    k1 = 0\n\n    read(*,*) n, p\n\n    do i =1, n\n\n        read(*,*) x\n\n        if (mod(x, 2) == 0) then\n\n            k0 = k0 +1\n\n        else\n\n            k1 =k1 +1\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (p ==0) then\n\n        if (k1 ==0) then\n\n            exponent =k0\n\n        else\n\n            exponent = n-1\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        if (k1 ==0) then\n\n            print '(a)', '0'\n\n            stop\n\n        else\n\n            exponent =n-1\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\n    if (exponent ==0) then\n\n        print '(a)', '1'\n\n    else\n\n        ! compute 2^exponent and print as a string\n\n        call print_power_of_two(exponent)\n\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine print_power_of_two(exp)\n\n        integer, intent(in) :: exp\n\n        character(len=100000) :: result  ! assuming exp is up to 1e5, 2^1e5 has 30103 digits\n\n        integer :: i, carry, digit, length\n\n        result = ''\n\n        result = '1'\n\n        length =1\n\n        do i =1, exp\n\n            carry =0\n\n            do digit =1, length\n\n                ! multiply each digit by 2, add carry\n\n                read(result(digit:digit), '(i1)') d\n\n                d = d *2 + carry\n\n                carry = d /10\n\n                d = mod(d, 10)\n\n                write(result(digit:digit), '(i1)') d\n\n            end do\n\n            if (carry >0) then\n\n                length = length +1\n\n                write(result(length:length), '(i1)') carry\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        ! reverse the string to get correct order\n\n        result = adjustl(result)\n\n        do i =1, length/2\n\n            c = result(i:i)\n\n            result(i:i) = result(length -i +1: length -i +1)\n\n            result(length -i +1: length -i +1) = c\n\n        end do\n\n        print '(a)', trim(adjustl(result))\n\n    end subroutine print_power_of_two\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but this code has some issues. For example, the initial result is '1', and then multiplying by 2 each time. But the way the digits are stored is in reverse order. Because when you multiply by 2, you start from the least significant digit. \n\nWait, no. For example, when you multiply 1 (stored as '1') by 2, you get 2. Then multiply by 2 again, you get 4, etc. But when the number becomes larger than 10, you need to handle the carry. \n\nWait, the current code's digit loop processes the digits from 1 to length, which is left to right, which would be the most significant digit first, but that's incorrect. \n\nThe correct way is to process the digits from least significant to most significant, which requires storing the number in reverse order. \n\nFor example, '1' is stored as '1' \u2192 1. Multiply by 2: becomes 2 \u2192 stored as '2'. Multiply by 2:4 \u2192 '4', etc. \n\nWhen the number is 16 (stored as '61'?), no. \n\nWait, the standard approach for big integers is to store the digits in reverse order. For example, the number 123 is stored as '321' in the string. This way, when you multiply, you can process the digits from left (least significant) to right (most significant), making it easier to handle the carry. \n\nSo in the subroutine, we need to store the digits in reverse order, then reverse them before printing. \n\nSo let's fix the subroutine:\n\nsubroutine print_power_of_two(exp)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: exp\n\n    character(len=100000) :: result\n\n    integer :: i, carry, digit, length, d\n\n    character :: c\n\n    result = ' '\n\n    result(1:1) = '1'\n\n    length =1\n\n    do i =1, exp\n\n        carry =0\n\n        do digit =1, length\n\n            if (result(digit:digit) == ' ') then\n\n                d=0\n\n            else\n\n                read(result(digit:digit), '(i1)') d\n\n            end if\n\n            d = d *2 + carry\n\n            carry = d /10\n\n            d = mod(d, 10)\n\n            write(result(digit:digit), '(i1)') d\n\n        end do\n\n        if (carry >0) then\n\n            length = length +1\n\n            if (length > len(result)) then\n\n                print *, 'result too long'\n\n                stop\n\n            end if\n\n            result(length:length) = achar(carry + ichar('0'))\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! reverse the digits\n\n    do i =1, length/2\n\n        c = result(i:i)\n\n        result(i:i) = result(length -i +1 : length -i +1)\n\n        result(length -i +1 : length -i +1) = c\n\n    end do\n\n    ! trim leading spaces and print\n\n    print '(a)', trim(adjustl(result))\n\nend subroutine\n\nThis way, during multiplication, the digits are processed from left to right (LSB to MSB), and after all multiplications, we reverse the digits to get the correct order. \n\nBut in the initial code, the result is stored with the least significant digit first. For example, after multiplying 1 (stored as '1') by 2 once, we get '2'. Then multiply by 2 again, '4', and so on. For 2^3 =8, stored as '8'. For 2^4=16, stored as '61' (during processing), then reversed to '16'. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStart with 1 \u2192 '1' (LSB first).\n\nMultiply by 2: digit 1: 1*2 =2 \u2192 no carry. result is '2'.\n\nMultiply by 2 again: 2*2=4 \u2192 '4'.\n\nMultiply by 2 again: 4*2=8 \u2192 '8'.\n\nMultiply by 2 again: 8*2=16. \n\nProcessing digit 1: 8*2=16. digit becomes 6, carry 1. \n\nThen, since carry is 1, increment length to 2, and store 1 in digit 2. So result is '61' (LSB first). \n\nWhen reversed, it becomes '16', which is correct. \n\nYes, this approach works. \n\nSo the code can be written with this subroutine. \n\nBut in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so initializing a large enough string is needed. For n up to 1e5, the number of digits in 2^1e5 is about 30103. So a string of length 1e5 is sufficient. \n\nSo putting it all together, the Fortran code would:\n\n- Read n and p.\n\n- Read the numbers and count k0 and k1.\n\n- Determine the exponent based on the conditions.\n\n- If exponent is zero, output 1.\n\n- Else, compute 2^exponent using the subroutine and output it.\n\nThis approach handles large exponents and outputs the correct number as a string. \n\nTherefore, the translated Fortran code would look like this."
