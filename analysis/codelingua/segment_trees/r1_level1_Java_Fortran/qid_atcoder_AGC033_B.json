    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe code seems to be solving a problem where there's a grid of height h and width w. There's a character starting at position (sr, sc), and there are n moves. The strings s and t represent operations. The code checks whether the character stays within the grid after all operations, considering both s and t's moves. \n\nThe Java code first processes the vertical movements (U and D) and then the horizontal (L and R). For each direction, it calculates safe ranges and checks if the starting position is within those ranges. If at any point the safe range becomes invalid (like usafe > dsafe), it ends early. Then, it does the same for left and right. Finally, it checks if the starting position is within the safe vertical and horizontal ranges and outputs YES or NO.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, variable declarations. In Java, they use int variables h, w, n, sr, sc. So in Fortran, these can be integers. Then the strings s and t. Fortran uses character arrays, so we'll need to read them as such.\n\nThe input is read from stdin. Java's Scanner reads the inputs in order. Fortran uses read statements. So we'll read h, w, n, sr, sc, then s and t. But in Fortran, reading strings can be tricky because they are fixed-length. We need to make sure we read them correctly. The Java code uses next() for s and t, which reads the next token. So in Fortran, perhaps we can read them as characters of length n each.\n\nWait, looking at the code, the strings s and t are of length n. Because in the loops, they iterate from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, when we read s and t, they should be of length n. So when reading, the user would input them as sequences of n characters each, possibly without spaces. So in Fortran, we can declare character(len=n) :: s, t.\n\nThen, the code processes the vertical direction first. Let's see:\n\nThe loop runs from i = n-1 down to 0. For each i, it checks the i-th character of s. Then, based on that, updates usafe or dsafe. Then, checks if usafe > dsafe. Then, if i >0, checks the (i-1)-th character of t and updates accordingly.\n\nSimilarly for the horizontal loop.\n\nSo in Fortran, since strings are 1-based, the Java code's s.charAt(i) would correspond to s(i+1) in Fortran. Because in Java, the indices are 0-based, in Fortran 1-based. So for example, when i is n-1 in Java, that's the last character. In Fortran, that would be s(n:n), assuming the string is of length n. Wait, if s is declared as character(len=n), then s(1:1) is the first character, s(n:n) is the last. So in Java, for i from 0 to n-1, in Fortran, it's 1 to n.\n\nBut in the loops here, the Java code is going from i = n-1 downto 0. So in Fortran, perhaps we need to loop from i = n downto 1. Because when Java's i is n-1, Fortran's i would be n. So for example, in the first loop:\n\nOriginal Java:\nfor (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)\n\nIn Fortran, this would be do i = n, 1, -1.\n\nSo each time, when accessing s's character, in Java it's s.charAt(i), which is the i-th character (0-based). In Fortran, since the loop is from n downto 1, the index would be i. So s(i:i) would be the correct character.\n\nWait, let's confirm. Suppose n is 3. Java's indexes are 0,1,2. So i starts at 2 (n-1 when n=3) and goes down to 0. In Fortran, loop i from 3 downto 1. So for each step in Java's i=2, 1,0, Fortran's i=3,2,1. So s in Java is length 3 (indices 0-2), in Fortran, s is length 3, indices 1-3. So s(3:3) is the last character (Java's index 2), s(2:2) is Java's index 1, etc. So the loop in Fortran for i from n downto 1, then s(i:i) gives the correct character.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the variables usafe, dsafe, lsafe, rsafe are initialized as 1, h, 1, w, respectively.\n\nIn the vertical processing loop, for each i from n downto 1 (Fortran loop), check s(i:i). If it's 'U', then usafe increments by 1. If 'D', dsafe decrements by 1. Then check if usafe > dsafe, set end to true.\n\nThen, if i > 1 (since in Java, the condition is i>0, which in Fortran's loop, i starts at n downto 1. So i=1 is the last iteration. So in Fortran, when i is 1, the original Java code's i would be 0, and the t check is for i-1 (i-1 = -1? No. Wait, in the Java code, during the first loop, for each i from n-1 downto 0. Then, inside the loop, after processing s's character, they check if i>0. Then, for t's character at i-1. Because in the original code, the loop is for i in 0..n-1 (but backwards). So when i is 0, the t check is for i-1 = -1, which is skipped. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nOriginal code's loop:\n\nfor (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    process s.charAt(i)\n    check if usafe > dsafe, break if so.\n    if (i > 0) {\n        process t.charAt(i-1)\n    }\n}\n\nWait, when i is 0, the loop runs, then the i>0 condition is false, so the t part is not processed. But for i in 1 to n-1 (Java's i), the t is processed. So for i=1 (Java), then t's i-1 is 0. So the t part is for steps where i in Java is >=1, i.e., original loop starts at i =n-1 down to 0, and for i>0 (i.e., i>=1), process t's i-1.\n\nSo in Fortran's loop, i runs from n downto 1. For each i, when the original i (Java) is n-1 downto 0. So in the loop, for each iteration in Fortran's i (1..n), the Java's i is (n - Fortran's i + 1 -1) ? Maybe not. Wait, in Fortran's loop, i starts at n and goes down to 1. Each Fortran's i corresponds to Java's i = i-1? Because Java's loop is for i from n-1 downto 0. For example, when Fortran's i is n, Java's i is n-1. When Fortran's i is 1, Java's i is 0.\n\nSo for the t processing part, in Java's code, when i is >=1 (Java's i), then t's char is at i-1. So in Fortran's code, when Fortran's i is >=2, then process t's i-1 -1? Wait, maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nFor each step i in Java (from n-1 downto 0):\n\nif (i >0) then process t's (i-1) character.\n\nSo for example, when Java's i is n-1, then the t processing is done if i>0 (which it is), and t's character is (n-1)-1 = n-2.\n\nIn Fortran's loop, when Fortran's i is n (Java's i is n-1), then the t processing is for t's (i-1-1) ?\n\nNo, perhaps I need to adjust for the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, when processing s's character at i (Fortran's i), which is Java's i-1. So during the loop for i in n downto 1:\n\nJava's i (original code's i) is (i-1) (since Fortran's i starts at n, which is Java's n-1? No, because Fortran's i ranges from 1 to n. Wait, no. Wait, Java's loop is for (i = n-1; i >=0; i--). So for each i in Java, the index is 0-based. For n steps. Fortran's loop is do i = n, 1, -1. So Fortran's i starts at n, then n-1, down to 1. For each i in Fortran, the corresponding Java i is (n - i). Because when Fortran's i is n, Java's i is n-1 (since n - n =0? No, perhaps this is not the right way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, in Java's loop, the loop runs for i from n-1 downto 0. So the indices are 0-based. In Fortran, the loop runs from i = n downto 1. So for each Fortran i, the Java's i is (i-1). For example:\n\nFortran i | Java i\nn        | n-1\nn-1      | n-2\n...\n1        | 0\n\nYes, because when Fortran's i is n, Java's i is n-1. So to get the correct character in s, which is Java's i-th, Fortran would use s(i) when i ranges from n downto 1, but since Java's s is 0-based, the Fortran's s is 1-based. So the code for s in Java's i is s.charAt(i), which in Fortran is s(i+1:i+1). Wait, no. Wait, in Java, the loop variable is i, which runs from n-1 downto 0. So for each i in Java, the s's character is at i. For example, when i is 0, s's first character. But in Fortran, the s is a string of length n, so s(1:1) is the first character. So when Java's i is 0, Fortran's s(1:1). So in Fortran, the loop variable is i in 1..n, but Java's i is n-1 downto 0. So how do they correspond?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to reverse the order. The first iteration in Java's loop is i = n-1, which is the last character of s. In Fortran's loop, the first iteration is i =n, which is the last character of s (since s is length n). So in Fortran's i-th iteration (i from n downto 1), s(i:i) corresponds to Java's s.charAt(n-1 - (n - i)) ? No, perhaps not. Wait, let's take an example. Suppose n=3. Java's i runs 2,1,0. Fortran's i runs 3,2,1. For each Fortran i:\n\nFortran i:3 \u2192 s(3:3) \u2192 Java's i=2 \u2192 s.charAt(2)\nFortran i:2 \u2192 s(2:2) \u2192 Java's i=1 \u2192 s.charAt(1)\nFortran i:1 \u2192 s(1:1) \u2192 Java's i=0 \u2192 s.charAt(0)\n\nYes, so in Fortran's loop, when processing i from n downto 1, the s(i:i) gives the same characters as Java's loop's s.charAt(i), where i in Java is 0-based and runs from n-1 downto 0. So the code for s is correct as is.\n\nSo for the first loop (vertical processing):\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = n-1; i >=0; i--) {\n    char c = s.charAt(i);\n    if (c == 'U') usafe++;\n    else if (c == 'D') dsafe--;\n    check usafe > dsafe\n    if (i>0) {\n        char tChar = t.charAt(i-1);\n        adjust usafe/dsafe based on tChar\n    }\n}\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ndo i = n, 1, -1\n    c = s(i:i)\n    if (c == 'U') then\n        usafe = usafe + 1\n    else if (c == 'D') then\n        dsafe = dsafe - 1\n    end if\n    if (usafe > dsafe) then\n        end = .true.\n        exit\n    end if\n    if (i > 1) then\n        tChar = t(i-1:i-1)\n        if (tChar == 'U') then\n            dsafe = min(dsafe + 1, h)\n        else if (tChar == 'D') then\n            usafe = max(usafe - 1, 1)\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, because in Java, when i>0, which in Fortran's i is i>0. Since Fortran's loop runs from n downto 1, i>0 is always true except when i=0, but since the loop is downto 1, i can be 1. So in Fortran, when i>1 (since Java's i>0 corresponds to i in Java being >=1. So for Fortran's loop, when i is 2 downto 1, the Java's i is 1 downto 0. So the condition i>0 in Java is equivalent to i (Java) >=1, which is Fortran's i >=2? Because Java's i is (Fortran's i -1). Because when Fortran's i is 2, Java's i is 1. So in Fortran, the condition for processing t's character is if (i > 1), because:\n\nIn Java, for i (Java) >=1 \u2192 Fortran's i (Java's i = Fortran's i -1) >=1 \u2192 Fortran's i >=2.\n\nSo in Fortran, when i>1 (Fortran's i), then process t's character at i-1 (since in Java, it's i-1. Wait, no. Wait, in Java's code, when processing the t character, it's t.charAt(i-1). But Java's i here is the loop variable (Java's i is in the original loop). For example, when Java's loop variable i is 2 (n-1=2 for n=3), then t's character is at i-1=1. In Fortran's loop variable i is 3 (for n=3), so in Fortran, the t's character would be at (i-1) -1? Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me re-express the original Java code's processing for t:\n\nIn the vertical loop:\n\nFor each i (Java) from n-1 downto 0:\n\nAfter processing s's i-th character, if i>0, then process the (i-1)-th character of t.\n\nSo when i (Java) is n-1, then processing t's (n-1-1) = n-2-th character. Which in Fortran's t, which is 1-based, would be (n-2)+1 =n-1. Wait, no. For example, t has n characters (since in Java, the code uses t.charAt(i-1) for i-1 from 0 to n-2. So t's length is n-1? Wait, no. Wait, the original code reads t as scanner.next(), which is a string. The loop for the vertical processing runs n times, and during the processing of each i (Java's i from n-1 downto 0), the code checks if i>0. Then, for t's (i-1) character. So in total, for the vertical loop, the code accesses t's characters from 0 to n-2 (since i ranges from n-1 downto 0, and when i>0, i-1 ranges from n-2 downto 0). So t's length is n-1. Wait, but in the Java code, the input is read as t = scanner.next(), which would have length n? Or no?\n\nWait, in the original problem, the strings s and t are both of length n. Because in the code, when processing the vertical loop, for each i in 0..n-1, the code accesses s.charAt(i). Then, for the t processing, when i>0, it accesses t's i-1. So for i from n-1 downto 0, during the loop, the t is accessed when i>0, which is i-1 from 0 to n-2. So t must be of length n-1. But that's not possible. Wait, no. Because in the Java code, after reading s and t with scanner.next(), perhaps s and t are of length n each. Because the problem statement probably says that s and t are of length n each. So the code in the vertical loop processes s's characters from 0 to n-1, and t's characters from 0 to n-2. Which would imply that t is of length n-1. But that's conflicting. So perhaps this is a mistake? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's vertical loop is processing s's characters in reverse order. For example, for the vertical direction, the loop runs n times. For each step i (n-1 downto 0), which corresponds to the i-th character of s. Then, for each step, after processing s's character, if i>0, then process the (i-1)-th character of t. So for example, for i from n-1 downto 0, the code processes s's i-th character, and t's (i-1)-th character (when i>0). Thus, t's length is n-1. But in the code, t is read as scanner.next(), which would read the entire next token. So perhaps the code assumes that t has length n. But according to the loop, when i is 0, the code does not process t's character. So for the vertical loop, the code accesses t's characters from 0 to n-2 (since when i>0, i ranges from n-1 downto 1, so i-1 ranges from n-2 downto 0). So for t to have n-1 characters. But in the code's input, they read s and t as next(), which implies that both are of length n. This suggests a possible bug in the original code. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the t's length is n. For example, the vertical loop's t processing uses t's first n-1 characters, and the horizontal loop's t processing uses the same t's characters (but perhaps shifted). Let me check the horizontal loop.\n\nIn the horizontal loop, the code again loops over i from n-1 downto 0. Then, after processing s's character, if i>0, processes t's (i-1) character. So similar to the vertical loop. So in this case, for the horizontal loop, t's characters are accessed from 0 to n-2 again. So in total, t must have n-1 characters, but the code reads it as a string of length n. That's a problem. Unless the original code has a mistake, but that's not for me to decide. I have to translate the code as is.\n\nBut regardless, in the Fortran code, I have to handle this correctly.\n\nSo the original code reads s and t as next() in Java. So in the input, s and t are read as strings. For the code to work, s must be of length n, t must be of length n as well. Because in the vertical loop, when i is 1 (Java), i-1 is 0, which is valid. And when i is n-1 (Java), i-1 is n-2. So t must have n characters, but the code in vertical and horizontal loops only accesses the first n-1 characters. So perhaps the code is correct, and the t's nth character is not used, which is possible. Or maybe I'm missing something. But since the problem is to translate the code as is, I'll proceed.\n\nIn Fortran, the code reads s and t as character(len=n), which are of length n. Then, in the vertical loop, when i>1 (Fortran's i), which corresponds to Java's i >=1. Then, the code accesses t's (i-1) character. For example, when Fortran's i is 3 (n=3), then i>1 is true, so process t's 3-1=2nd character, which is t(2:2). But in Java, the code would be processing t's (i-1) = 3-1-1=1 (Java's index). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the vertical loop, Fortran's i runs from n downto 1. For each i:\n\nIf i > 1 (Fortran's i), then process t's (i-1) character.\n\nSo for example, when i is 3 (Fortran), then process t(2:2). When i is 2 (Fortran), process t(1:1). When i is 1 (Fortran), since i>1 is false, no processing.\n\nIn Java's code, when i (Java) is 3-1=2 (assuming n=3), then processing t's 2-1=1st character (Java index). Which is t(1) in Java. Which is the second character in Fortran's 1-based index. So t(2:2) in Fortran.\n\nSo, in Fortran, for vertical loop:\n\nFortran i | process t's (i-1) character (t(i-1:i-1))\ni=3 \u2192 t(2:2)\ni=2 \u2192 t(1:1)\ni=1 \u2192 no processing.\n\nBut in Java's code, during vertical loop, for i (Java) from n-1 downto 0:\n\nif i>0, then process t's (i-1) character.\n\nFor example, when Java's i is 2 (n=3), i>0 is true, process t's 1 (Java index). So in Fortran, when i (Fortran) is 3 (Java's i=2), process t's (3-1) = 2, which is the 3rd character in Fortran. Wait, no. Wait, Java's t is 0-based. So in Java, t's 1st character is index 0. So when Java's code processes t's (i-1) for i=2 (Java), that's t(1) (Java index 1). Which is the second character in Fortran. Because Fortran's t is 1-based.\n\nSo in Fortran, for Java's code's t's character at index (i-1) in Java, which is (i-1) in 0-based, that translates to (i-1 +1) in Fortran, which is i.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's take an example:\n\nJava code:\n\ni (Java) is 2 \u2192 t.charAt(i-1) \u2192 t's index 1.\n\nFortran code: i (Fortran) is 3 (since Java's i=2 corresponds to Fortran's i=3).\n\nIn Fortran's vertical loop:\n\nif i>1 (i=3>1 \u2192 true), then t's character is at (i-1) = 2 (Fortran's index 2).\n\nWhich is correct, because Fortran's t(2:2) is the same as Java's t.charAt(1).\n\nSo the code in Fortran for the vertical loop's t processing is correct.\n\nSimilarly for the horizontal loop.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, variables in Fortran:\n\nDeclare h, w, n, sr, sc as integers.\n\nDeclare s and t as character(len=n).\n\nRead the inputs:\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc\nread(*,*) s\nread(*,*) t\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, when reading a character variable, the input must have exactly the length of the variable. So if the user inputs \"UDLR\" for s, but n is 3, then the code will read the first 3 characters. But I'm not sure. So to read the strings s and t, which are of length n, the code should read them as a single token. For example, if the user inputs the s and t as sequences of characters without spaces, then it's okay.\n\nNow, variables end is a logical, initialized to .false.\n\nusafe and dsafe are initialized to 1 and h.\n\nSimilarly for lsafe and rsafe.\n\nThen, process the vertical loop:\n\nusafe = 1\ndsafe = h\nend = .false.\ndo i = n, 1, -1\n    c = s(i:i)\n    if (c == 'U') then\n        usafe = usafe + 1\n    else if (c == 'D') then\n        dsafe = dsafe - 1\n    end if\n    if (usafe > dsafe) then\n        end = .true.\n        exit\n    end if\n    if (i > 1) then\n        tc = t(i-1:i-1)\n        if (tc == 'U') then\n            dsafe = min(dsafe +1, h)\n        else if (tc == 'D') then\n            usafe = max(usafe -1, 1)\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, if end is true, exit. Then process the horizontal loop similarly.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the vertical loop, the code may have set end to true. But the horizontal loop is still processed. Wait no, in the Java code, after processing the vertical loop (which may set end = true and break), the code proceeds to process the horizontal loop regardless, and then checks end again. So if the vertical loop sets end to true, the horizontal loop still runs and possibly sets end to true again. But in the end, the code checks if end is true. So in Fortran, after the vertical loop, end may be .true., but the horizontal loop will still run. So the code must process both loops regardless of whether the vertical loop set end to true. \n\nWait, no. In the Java code, the vertical loop and horizontal loop are separate. So the code first processes the vertical loop, which may set end to true and break. Then, regardless of that, it processes the horizontal loop. Then, after both loops, checks if end is true. So in Fortran, we have to process both loops.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the vertical loop, the code proceeds to the horizontal loop, even if end is already .true. from the vertical loop. So during the horizontal loop, the code may again set end to .true.\n\nBut in the Java code, the code first processes vertical loop, then horizontal loop. So in Fortran, same.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after processing the vertical loop, process the horizontal loop.\n\nThen, after both loops, check if the starting position (sr, sc) is within the safe ranges and end is .false.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif ( (sr >= usafe .and. sr <= dsafe) .and. (sc >= lsafe .and. sc <= rsafe) .and. .not. end ) then\n    print *, \"YES\"\nelse\n    print *, \"NO\"\nend if\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the case where end is set during vertical loop. Then, during horizontal loop, it may also set end to true, but since it's already true, the loop may exit early.\n\nBut the code in Fortran will proceed to process both loops. For example, after vertical loop sets end to true, horizontal loop will still run. But during the horizontal loop, the code may check lsafe and rsafe, but since end is already true, it's possible that some condition sets end to true again, but that's redundant. But the code as per the original Java code must process both loops.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nVariables:\n\ninteger :: h, w, n, sr, sc\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s, t ! Not sure about dynamic length. Alternatively, read as fixed-length.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read into a character variable, you need to specify the length. So if n is read first, then the code can allocate s and t with length n.\n\nBut in Fortran 90 and later, you can use allocatable characters. So:\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc\nallocate(character(n) :: s, t)\nread(*,*) s\nread(*,*) t\n\nBut how to read them? Because when you read with read(*,*) s, it expects the input to be a string of exactly n characters. For example, if the input line for s is \"UDU\", then s will be \"UDU\".\n\nBut when the user inputs the strings, perhaps with leading or trailing spaces, but the code expects the entire string to be read. So using list-directed input (read(*, *)) may split on spaces, which is not desired. For example, if the s is \"U D\", then the read would read \"U\" as the first token and \"D\" as the next, but that's not intended.\n\nTo avoid this, the code should read the entire line as a single string. So perhaps using formatted input with a format specifier.\n\nSo for reading s and t, the code can read them using a format of (A), which reads the entire line, but truncated to the length of the variable. So:\n\nread(*,'(A)') s\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read with '(A)', it reads the entire line, but leading and trailing spaces are included. So if the input line is \"UDU \" (with trailing space), then s would be \"UDU \" (including the space). Which may be a problem if the code expects exactly n characters. So perhaps the code should read the s and t as n characters each.\n\nBut how to ensure that? For example, if the user enters more than n characters, it's truncated, less, it's padded with spaces.\n\nBut according to the original code, s and t are read as next() tokens, which in Java would read until whitespace. So the code expects that s and t are provided as contiguous sequences of characters without spaces, each exactly length n.\n\nSo in Fortran, to read s and t as exactly n characters each, the code can use a format specifier of (A), and the user must input the correct length. So:\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\nread(*, '(A)') t\n\nBut in Fortran, if s is declared as character(n), then reading with (A) will read the entire line, but the variable will take the first n characters. If the line is longer than n, the rest is ignored. If shorter, padded with spaces.\n\nAssuming that the user's input for s and t is exactly n characters each, this will work. Otherwise, it may lead to errors. But according to the problem statement, s and t are of length n, so this is okay.\n\nBut in the code, the original Java code uses s and t as strings of length n each. So the Fortran code should read them as such.\n\nNow, putting all this together.\n\nThe Fortran code would look like:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC033_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: h, w, n, sr, sc\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: s, t\n    logical :: end\n    integer :: usafe, dsafe, lsafe, rsafe, i\n    character :: c, tc\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc\n    allocate(character(n) :: s)\n    allocate(character(n) :: t)\n    read(*,'(A)') s\n    read(*,'(A)') t\n\n    end = .false.\n\n    ! Process vertical direction (U/D)\n    usafe = 1\n    dsafe = h\n    do i = n, 1, -1\n        c = s(i:i)\n        if (c == 'U') then\n            usafe = usafe + 1\n        else if (c == 'D') then\n            dsafe = dsafe - 1\n        end if\n        if (usafe > dsafe) then\n            end = .true.\n            exit\n        end if\n        if (i > 1) then\n            tc = t(i-1:i-1)\n            if (tc == 'U') then\n                dsafe = min(dsafe + 1, h)\n            else if (tc == 'D') then\n                usafe = max(usafe - 1, 1)\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Process horizontal direction (L/R)\n    lsafe = 1\n    rsafe = w\n    do i = n, 1, -1\n        c = s(i:i)\n        if (c == 'L') then\n            lsafe = lsafe + 1\n        else if (c == 'R') then\n            rsafe = rsafe - 1\n        end if\n        if (lsafe > rsafe) then\n            end = .true.\n            exit\n        end if\n        if (i > 1) then\n            tc = t(i-1:i-1)\n            if (tc == 'L') then\n                rsafe = min(rsafe + 1, w)\n            else if (tc == 'R') then\n                lsafe = max(lsafe - 1, 1)\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Check result\n    if ( (sr >= usafe .and. sr <= dsafe) .and. (sc >= lsafe .and. sc <= rsafe) .and. .not. end ) then\n        print *, \"YES\"\n    else\n        print *, \"NO\"\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(s)\n    deallocate(t)\nend program atcoder_AGC033_B\n\nBut wait, in the horizontal loop, the code is processing s's i-th character again. But in the Java code, the vertical loop processes s's characters for U and D, and the horizontal loop processes s's characters for L and R. So in the Fortran code, the horizontal loop is also processing s(i:i), checking for 'L' and 'R'.\n\nYes. Because in Java's horizontal loop, the code has:\n\nfor (int i = n-1; i >=0; i--) {\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'L') ... else if (s.charAt(i) == 'R') ...\n\nSo yes, the horizontal loop is processing the same s string again, but for different characters. So the Fortran code correctly loops over the same s and processes 'L' and 'R' in the horizontal loop.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the horizontal loop, the code uses the same t as the vertical loop. Because in Java's code, during the horizontal loop, it uses the same t string, but accesses the same indices. For example, during the horizontal loop's processing, when i is n-1, and i>0, it accesses t's (i-1) character, which is the same as the vertical loop's access. But in Java, the vertical and horizontal loops are separate and process the same t string's characters. So in Fortran's code, the same t is used in both loops.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- In Fortran, when reading the strings s and t, if the user inputs more than n characters, they get truncated. If less, they are padded with spaces. But according to the problem statement, s and t are exactly n characters each, so the code is correct.\n\n- The variables are declared correctly, with usafe, dsafe, etc., initialized properly.\n\n- The loops run correctly from n downto 1, and the conditions are handled properly.\n\n- The min and max functions in Fortran are used correctly. For example, min(dsafe + 1, h) is equivalent to Math.min in Java.\n\n- The final check includes all conditions.\n\nSo this should be the correct translation."
