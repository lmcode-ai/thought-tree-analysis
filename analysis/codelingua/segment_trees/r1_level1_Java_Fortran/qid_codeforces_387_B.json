So the total is the sum of the elements that couldn't be matched during the processing plus the remaining elements that weren't processed because there's no pre left. So the formula ans +",

Suppose in Fortran, n=3, m=2. req = [1,2,3], pre=[4,5]. Then, i starts at 3, j at 2 (since m=2, pre has indices 1 and 2? Wait, no. Wait, m is the size of pre. So in Fortran, pre is dimension(m), indices 1 to m. So in this example, pre has indices 1 and 2 (since m=2). So j starts at 2. First iteration: req(3) =3. pre(2) =5. 3>5? No. So j becomes 1. Then i becomes 2. Loop condition: i=2 > =1, j=1 >=1. So enter loop. Check req(2)=2 > pre(1)=4? No. j becomes 0. i becomes 1. Loop condition: i=1 > =1, j=0 >=1? No. So loop exits. Then, ans is 0. Then, ans + (i) would be 0 +1=1. But wait, in Java code, it's ans +i +1. So in this example, after the loop, i is 1, j is 0. In Java code, after the loop, i would be 0 (since after processing i=1, it's decremented to 0). So ans + i +1 would be 0+0+1=1. But in Fortran, the code would compute ans + i. Because after the loop, i is 1. But the remaining elements are from 1 to i (which is 1 element). So 1 element. So ans (0) +1=1. So the correct output would be the same. So the Fortran code needs to compute ans + i. Because after the loop, the remaining elements are from 1 to i, which is i elements. But wait, in Java, the remaining elements are i+1 elements (since the index starts at 0). So when i is 0, it's 1 element (index 0). So in Fortran, the remaining elements are i elements (indices 1 to i). So to get the same count, in Fortran, after the loop, the remaining elements are i elements (since i is the current index, which is the next element to process). But in the Java code, after the loop, the elements that are left are from 0 to i (inclusive?), but I'm a bit confused.",

So in Fortran:\n\ni = n\n\nj = m\n\nans = 0\n\ndo while (i >=1 .and. j > =1) if (req(i) > pre(j)) then\n\n      ans = ans +1\n\n   else\n\n      j = j -1\n\n   end if\n\n   i = i -1\n\nend do\n\nThen, after the loop, the remaining elements are from 1 to i+1 (since the last processed was i+1, and i is now i after processing). Wait, maybe not. Let's see an example. Suppose in Fortran:\n\nn=3, m=2. req is [1,2,3], pre is [4,5]. Initially i=3, j=2. Check req(3) > pre(2)? 3>5? No. So j becomes 1. Then i becomes 2. Loop condition: 2>=1 and 1>=1. True.\n\nCheck req(2) > pre(1)? 2>4? No. j becomes 0. i becomes 1. Loop condition: 1>=1 and 0>=1? False. Exit loop. Then, i is 1. So the remaining elements are from 1 to i=1. So 1 element. ans is 0. So total is 0+1=1. But in Java, the code would have:\n\nAfter processing i=2 (Java index), j=1. Then i-- becomes 1.

The main logic is in the while loop where it compares elements from the end of both lists. \n\nSo in Fortran, I'll need to read the inputs, store them in arrays, and then perform the same comparison logic. Let me think step by step.\n\nIn Java, they use ArrayLists. In Fortran, I can use allocatable arrays. But since the size is known after reading n and m, I can allocate them dynamically.\n\nWait, the Java code reads n elements for req and m for pre. So in Fortran, after reading n and m, I can allocate req(n) and pre(m), then read each element.\n\nThe loop variables i and j start at the end of their respective arrays (n-1 and m-1 in Java, but Fortran arrays start at 1 by default. Wait, but in Java, the first element is 0. So when translating, the indices need to be adjusted. For example, in Java, req.get(i) where i is from n-1 down to 0. In Fortran, if the array starts at 1, then the indices would be from n down to 1. So the loop would start i = n and j = m, decrementing until they reach 1 or 0.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, array indices can be defined. But by default, if you declare an array with dimension(n), the indices are 1 to n. So when the Java code uses i starting at n-1 (for a list of size n), in Fortran, the equivalent would be starting at n.\n\nSo the loop in Java: i starts at n-1 (so for n elements, indexes 0 to n-1). In Fortran, the array would be from 1 to n, so the starting index is n. Similarly for m.\n\nSo in the Java code, the initial values are i = n-1 and j = m-1. In Fortran, I should set i = n and j = m.\n\nThen, the while loop continues while i >=0 and j >=0. But in Fortran, the arrays start at 1. So when i is 0, that would be out of bounds. So the condition in Fortran would be i >=1 and j >=1. Wait, no. Because in Java, when i is -1, the loop stops. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal Java code: while (i >=0 && j >=0). So as long as both i and j are >=0, the loop runs. Then, inside, if req.get(i) > pre.get(j), then ans increments. Else, j decrements. Then i decrements each time.\n\nWait, so in Java, for each iteration, i decreases by 1. So starting from i = n-1 down to possibly 0, and then when i becomes -1, the loop stops.\n\nSo in Fortran, the equivalent would be starting i at n, and decrementing by 1 each time until i becomes 0. Because in Fortran, the array starts at 1. So for example, if n is 3, Java indices 0,1,2. Fortran indices 1,2,3. So when i starts at n (3) and goes down to 1.\n\nSo the loop in Fortran would run while i >=1 and j >=1.\n\nBut in Java, the loop can have i go to -1. Wait, but once i becomes negative, the loop stops. So the loop runs as long as i and j are >=0.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop should run while i >=1 and j >=1. Because once i becomes 0, the loop stops. But in the Java code, when i is 0, it's allowed. So in Fortran, the loop continues as long as i >=1 and j >=1. But wait, that would not allow i to be 0. Let me think.\n\nIn Java, the loop runs when i >=0. So for i starting at n-1 (n is the number of elements), when n is 3, i starts at 2. Then, after each iteration, i decreases by 1. The loop runs for i=2,1,0, then when i becomes -1, it exits.\n\nIn Fortran, the array indices are 1-based. So for n elements, the indices are 1 to n. So the loop in Fortran should start with i =n and decrement until i becomes 0, but accessing the array elements from n down to 1.\n\nBut in Fortran, when i becomes 0, trying to access req(i) would be out of bounds. So the loop condition in Fortran must ensure that i and j are within their array bounds.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure the loop as:\n\nInitialize i = n, j = m, ans =0.\n\nThen, do while (i >=1 .and. j >=1)\n\n   if (req(i) > pre(j)) then\n      ans = ans +1\n   else\n      j = j -1\n   end if\n   i = i -1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, even if j becomes negative, the loop continues as long as i is >=0. Wait no, the loop condition is i >=0 AND j >=0. So if either i or j becomes negative, the loop stops. So in Fortran, the loop should run while i >=1 AND j >=1. Because once i becomes 0 or j becomes 0, the loop stops.\n\nBut then after the loop, there's the code that computes ans + i +1. Wait, in Java, after the loop, it's ans + i +1. Let's see: after the loop, i and j are either less than 0. Wait, no. The loop runs while i >=0 and j >=0. So when the loop exits, either i <0 or j <0 (or both). So after the loop, the Java code adds ans + i +1. But if i is -1, then ans + (-1 +1) = ans +0. But if during the loop, j became negative but i is still >=0, then after the loop, i would be the value after the last decrement. For example, if j becomes -1, but i was 0, then after the loop, i is -1.\n\nWait, this is a bit tricky. Let's take an example. Suppose n=3, m=2. req = [1,2,3], pre=[4,5]. Then in the loop:\n\ni starts at 2 (Java index), j at 1.\n\nCheck if 3>5? No. So j becomes 0, i becomes 1.\n\nLoop condition: i >=0 (1) and j >=0 (0). So true.\n\nCheck req[1]=2 > pre[0]=4? No. j becomes -1. i becomes 0.\n\nLoop condition: i >=0 (0) and j >=0 (-1): false. Exit loop.\n\nThen ans is 0. Then ans + i +1 = 0 + (-1) +1? Wait, wait, Java code's System.out.print(ans + i +1); Wait, after the loop, i is -1, because after the last iteration (i=0), we decrement i to -1? Wait no. Let me re-examine the loop.\n\nThe loop in Java is:\n\nwhile (i >=0 && j >=0) {\n\n   if (req.get(i) > pre.get(j)) {\n\n      ans++;\n\n   } else {\n\n      j--;\n\n   }\n\n   i--;\n\n}\n\nSo in each iteration, after the if-else, i is decremented.\n\nSo for the example I mentioned, initial i=2 (n-1=2), j=1 (m-1=1).\n\nFirst iteration: check if req[2]=3>pre[1]=5? No. So j becomes 0. Then i becomes 1.\n\nLoop condition: i=1 >=0, j=0 >=0. So enter loop.\n\nCheck req[1]=2 > pre[0]=4? No. j becomes -1. Then i becomes 0.\n\nLoop condition: i=0 >=0 is true, j=-1 >=0 is false. So loop condition is false. Exit loop.\n\nThen, ans is 0. Then, ans + i +1 = 0 + 0 +1 =1. But i is 0 here. Wait, no. Because the last i decrement was after the second iteration. Wait, in the first iteration, i was 2, then becomes 1. Second iteration, after if-else, i is decremented to 0. Then loop condition checks again. Since j is -1, condition is false, so loop exits.\n\nSo in the Java code, after the loop, i is 0. Because in the second iteration, after the if-else, i is decremented to 0, then the loop checks again and exits.\n\nSo the code computes ans + i +1. So in the example, ans is 0, i is 0, so 0 +0 +1=1. But what is the correct output here?\n\nIn this example, the problem is trying to find how many elements in req cannot be matched. Let me think. The logic of the code: it compares the largest req element with the largest pre element. If req's is larger, that means this requirement cannot be met, so ans increases. Else, we use that pre element and move j down.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to count how many requirements are not satisfied by the available pre elements, assuming that each pre can be used once, and they are sorted in some way. But the code is processing from the end of both lists. So the code is greedy: match the largest possible req with the largest possible pre. If the req is larger than the pre, it can't be matched, so ans increments. Otherwise, use that pre and move j.\n\nSo the ans counts the number of req elements that couldn't be matched. Then, after processing as much as possible, if there are any remaining req elements (i is the index, but since i is decremented each time, after the loop, i could be -1. Then the code adds ans + (i +1), which would be ans +0 if i is -1. Wait, perhaps that part is adding the remaining elements in req that were not processed because j ran out.\n\nWait, after the loop, i is the index after the last processed element. For example, if all elements were processed, i would be -1. But the code adds ans + (i +1). So ans is the count of req elements that couldn't be matched, and (i+1) is the number of unprocessed elements (since after the loop, i is the index of the first unprocessed element, but since the loop stops when j runs out, the remaining i elements (from 0 to i) are all unprocessed. So the total is ans + (i +1).\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose after the loop, i is -1. Then (i+1) is 0. So ans +0. But if the loop stops because j is -1 but i is still >=0, then i could be, say, 5. Then (i+1) would be 6. But that's if the loop stops because j is exhausted. So the code is adding ans (the count of req elements that couldn't be matched even after checking the available pre) plus the remaining req elements that were not checked because j ran out.\n\nSo the total is the sum of the elements that couldn't be matched during the processing plus the remaining elements that weren't processed because there's no pre left.\n\nSo the formula ans + i +1 is equivalent to ans + (i +1) (since i could be negative, but in Java, if i is -1, i+1 is 0). So how does this translate in Fortran?\n\nIn Java, after the loop, i is the value after the last decrement. For example, if the loop runs until i becomes -1, then after the loop, i is -1. The code adds ans + (i +1) which is ans +0.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop runs while i >=1 and j >=1. So when the loop exits, either i <1 or j <1. So after the loop, i is the current value. For example, if during the loop, i was 1, and then we decrement it to 0, then the loop exits, and i is 0.\n\nSo the remaining elements are the ones from 1 to i (if any). Wait, no. Because if the loop exits because j <1, then i may be >=1. For example, suppose j becomes 0, but i is 5. Then the loop stops. The remaining req elements are from i=5 down to 1 (since in the next steps, they wouldn't be processed as the loop is not entered). So the number of remaining elements is i (since in Fortran, i is 5, which is the index of the first unprocessed element). Wait, but in the Java code, the remaining elements are from 0 to i (if i is >=0). So in the Java code, the remaining elements are i+1 (since indexes 0..i is i+1 elements). But in Fortran, the remaining elements would be from 1 to i, which is i elements. Wait, but in Fortran, after the loop, the last processed element is i+1. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think.\n\nIn Fortran, during the loop, i starts at n (the end of the req array), and each iteration decreases by 1. The loop runs while i >=1 and j >=1.\n\nSo, for example, if the loop exits when j becomes 0 (j <1), but i is still 3. That means that in the last iteration, j was 1, and after processing, j becomes 0. Then, after the loop, i is 2 (because during the loop iteration, i was 3, then we process and decrement i to 2). Wait, no. Let's step through an example.\n\nSuppose in Fortran, n=3, m=2. req = [1,2,3], pre=[4,5].\n\nThen, i starts at 3, j at 2 (since m=2, pre has indices 1 and 2? Wait, no. Wait, m is the size of pre. So in Fortran, pre is dimension(m), indices 1 to m. So in this example, pre has indices 1 and 2 (since m=2). So j starts at 2.\n\nFirst iteration: req(3) =3. pre(2) =5. 3>5? No. So j becomes 1. Then i becomes 2.\n\nLoop condition: i=2 >=1, j=1 >=1. So enter loop.\n\nCheck req(2)=2 > pre(1)=4? No. j becomes 0. i becomes 1.\n\nLoop condition: i=1 >=1, j=0 >=1? No. So loop exits.\n\nThen, ans is 0. Then, ans + (i) would be 0 +1=1. But wait, in Java code, it's ans +i +1. So in this example, after the loop, i is 1, j is 0.\n\nIn Java code, after the loop, i would be 0 (since after processing i=1, it's decremented to 0). So ans + i +1 would be 0+0+1=1. But in Fortran, the code would compute ans + i. Because after the loop, i is 1. But the remaining elements are from 1 to i (which is 1 element). So 1 element. So ans (0) +1=1. So the correct output would be the same.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to compute ans + i. Because after the loop, the remaining elements are from 1 to i, which is i elements.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the remaining elements are i+1 elements (since the index starts at 0). So when i is 0, it's 1 element (index 0). So in Fortran, the remaining elements are i elements (indices 1 to i). So to get the same count, in Fortran, after the loop, the remaining elements are i elements (since i is the current index, which is the next element to process). But in the Java code, after the loop, the elements that are left are from 0 to i (inclusive?), but I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula in Fortran should be ans + (i), because in the Java code, the remaining elements are i+1 (since when the loop exits, i is the index after the last processed element). For example, in Java, if the loop processes up to i=0, then after the loop, i is -1. The remaining elements are from 0 to i (but i is -1, which is none). So (i+1) is 0. So in Fortran, after the loop, i is the index of the last processed element minus 1. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in Fortran, the number of remaining elements is max(0, i) because after the loop, if i is >=1, then those elements haven't been processed. So for example, if j ran out, and i is 5, then there are 5 elements left (indices 1-5). So adding ans +5 gives the correct count.\n\nWait, but in Java, the remaining elements are i+1 (when i is >=0). Because the loop exits when i <0 or j <0. So the remaining elements are from 0 to i (Java), which is i+1 elements. In Fortran, the loop exits when i <1 or j <1. The remaining elements are from 1 to i (Fortran), which is i elements.\n\nSo for example, in Java, i=0: 1 element (index 0). In Fortran, if i=1: 1 element (index 1). So the number of remaining elements in Fortran is i.\n\nSo the code in Java is ans + (i+1) (after the loop). In Fortran, it should be ans + i.\n\nBut how to handle when the loop exits because i becomes 0? Because in Fortran, if i is 0, then the loop exits, and the remaining elements are 0, which is correct. Because if i is 0, it's less than 1, so no elements left. So ans +0.\n\nSo the Fortran code should output ans + max(i,0).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, after the loop, i can be 0 or j can be 0. Let's see.\n\nAfter the loop in Fortran, the variables i and j may be 0 or some value.\n\nSo the total is ans + max(i, 0).\n\nBut how to compute that. For example, if i is 5, then 5 elements are remaining. If i is 0, then 0.\n\nIn Fortran, after the loop, i is the value after the last decrement. Let's see:\n\nIn the loop, the code is:\n\ndo while (i >=1 .and. j >=1)\n\n   ... processing ...\n\n   i = i -1\n\nend do\n\nWait, no. Because in each iteration of the loop, after processing, i is decremented. Wait, let's see the code structure.\n\nIn Java:\n\nwhile (i >=0 && j >=0) {\n\n   if (req.get(i) > pre.get(j)) {\n\n      ans++;\n\n   } else {\n\n      j--;\n\n   }\n\n   i--;\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, to replicate this, we need to process each element and decrement i each time. So in Fortran:\n\ni = n\n\nj = m\n\nans = 0\n\ndo while (i >=1 .and. j >=1)\n\n   if (req(i) > pre(j)) then\n\n      ans = ans +1\n\n   else\n\n      j = j -1\n\n   end if\n\n   i = i -1\n\nend do\n\nThen, after the loop, the remaining elements are from 1 to i+1 (since the last processed was i+1, and i is now i after processing). Wait, maybe not. Let's see an example.\n\nSuppose in Fortran:\n\nn=3, m=2.\n\nreq is [1,2,3], pre is [4,5].\n\nInitially i=3, j=2.\n\nCheck req(3) > pre(2)? 3>5? No. So j becomes 1. Then i becomes 2.\n\nLoop condition: 2>=1 and 1>=1. True.\n\nCheck req(2) > pre(1)? 2>4? No. j becomes 0. i becomes 1.\n\nLoop condition: 1>=1 and 0>=1? False. Exit loop.\n\nThen, i is 1. So the remaining elements are from 1 to i=1. So 1 element. ans is 0. So total is 0+1=1.\n\nBut in Java, the code would have:\n\nAfter processing i=2 (Java index), j=1. Then i-- becomes 1. Then loop runs again.\n\nCheck req(1) > pre(0) (which is invalid, but Java code doesn't check pre.get(j) until after the loop). Wait, no. In Java, j is 1 (initial j=1). Then inside the loop, req.get(1) is 2, pre.get(1) is 5. So no. Then j becomes 0. i becomes 1-1=0.\n\nLoop condition: i=0 >=0 and j=0 >=0. True.\n\nCheck req(0) > pre(0) (assuming pre has index 0). req(0)=1, pre(0)=4. So no. j becomes -1. i becomes -1.\n\nLoop condition: i=-1 >=0? No. Exit loop.\n\nans is 0. Then ans + i +1 =0 + (-1) +1=0. But this contradicts the Fortran example. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn Java code:\n\nn=3, m=2.\n\nreq = [1,2,3], pre=[4,5].\n\ni starts at 2 (n-1), j starts at 1 (m-1).\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nreq.get(2) is 3. pre.get(1) is 5. 3>5? No. So j becomes 0. i becomes 1.\n\nLoop condition: i=1 >=0 and j=0 >=0. True.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nreq.get(1) is 2. pre.get(0) is 4. 2>4? No. j becomes -1. i becomes 0.\n\nLoop condition: i=0 >=0 and j=-1 >=0? False. Exit loop.\n\nans is 0. ans + i +1 = 0 +0 +1=1. So Java's output is 1.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\ni starts at 3, j at 2.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nreq(3) =3, pre(2)=5. 3>5? No. j=2-1=1. i=3-1=2.\n\nLoop condition: i=2 >=1, j=1 >=1. True.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nreq(2)=2, pre(1)=4. 2>4? No. j=0. i=1.\n\nLoop condition: i=1 >=1, j=0 >=1? False. Exit loop.\n\nans is 0. Then i is 1. So ans +i=0+1=1. So the output is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should output ans +i, which in this case gives the correct result.\n\nSo the formula in Fortran is ans + i.\n\nBut what if i becomes 0 during processing?\n\nFor example, suppose n=1, m=1. req = [5], pre=[4].\n\nJava code:\n\ni=0, j=0. req.get(0)=5>4: yes. ans=1. i becomes -1. loop exits. ans + i+1 =1 + (-1)+1=1.\n\nFortran code:\n\ni=1, j=1. req(1)=5>pre(1)=4: yes. ans=1. i becomes 0. loop condition: i=0 >=1 is false. exit. ans +i=1+0=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=1. req=[3,4], pre=[5].\n\nJava code:\n\ni=1, j=0. loop condition: i>=0 and j>=0.\n\nreq.get(1)=4>5? No. j becomes -1. i becomes 0. loop exits. ans=0. ans +0 +1=1.\n\nFortran code:\n\ni=2, j=1. req(2)=4>5? No. j=0. i=1. loop condition: i=1 >=1 and j=0 >=1? False. ans=0. ans +1 =1.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code ans +i gives the same result.\n\nSo the correct formula in Fortran is ans + i.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should print ans + i.\n\nNow, let's put this all together.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read n integers into req array.\n\n3. Read m integers into pre array.\n\n4. Initialize i =n, j =m, ans=0.\n\n5. Loop while i >=1 and j >=1:\n\n   a. If req(i) > pre(j), increment ans.\n\n   b. Else, decrement j.\n\n   c. Decrement i.\n\n6. After the loop, output ans +i.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to read the inputs.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read using read *, n, m.\n\nThen allocate req(n), pre(m).\n\nThen read the n elements for req.\n\nThen read the m elements for pre.\n\nBut in Java, the req and pre are read in two separate loops. So in Fortran, after reading n and m, read the next n integers into req, then the next m into pre.\n\nBut the input could be given in one line or multiple lines. The code should read them correctly.\n\nBut assuming the input is provided as in the Java code: n and m are first, then the n req elements, then the m pre elements.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nread *, n, m\n\nallocate(req(n), pre(m))\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read *, req(i)\n\nend do\n\ndo i =1, m\n\n   read *, pre(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen, the processing loop.\n\nInitialize i =n, j =m, ans=0.\n\ndo while (i >=1 .and. j >=1)\n\n   if (req(i) > pre(j)) then\n\n      ans = ans +1\n\n   else\n\n      j = j -1\n\n   end if\n\n   i = i -1\n\nend do\n\nprint *, ans + i\n\nBut wait, the Java code's output is ans + i +1. But as we saw, in Fortran it's ans +i.\n\nWait, no. In Java, after the loop, i is the index after the last processed element. So the remaining elements are i+1. But in Fortran, after the loop, i is the index after the last processed element (because in each iteration, after processing, i is decremented). So in Fortran, the remaining elements are i (since i is the index after the last processed element, but in 1-based indices, the remaining elements are from 1 to i).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose in Fortran, i starts at n, and each iteration decrements i by 1. So after processing, i is the next element to process. For example, if i was 3 and then becomes 2 after processing, the next element to process is 2. So when the loop exits, the remaining elements are from 1 to i (if any).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's take an example where n=3, and the loop runs for i=3,2,1. Then i becomes 0. The remaining elements are 1 to 0: none. So ans +i (0) = ans.\n\nAnother example: the loop runs until i=2, then j becomes 0. Then i is 1 (after processing). So the remaining elements are 1 to i=1: one element. So ans +1.\n\nSo yes, the formula ans +i in Fortran gives the correct number of remaining elements.\n\nTherefore, the code should output ans + i.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nHere's the Fortran code:\n\nprogram codeforces_387_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, i, j, ans\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: req, pre\n\n    read *, n, m\n    allocate(req(n))\n    allocate(pre(m))\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        read *, req(i)\n    end do\n\n    do i = 1, m\n        read *, pre(i)\n    end do\n\n    i = n\n    j = m\n    ans = 0\n\n    do while (i >= 1 .and. j >= 1)\n        if (req(i) > pre(j)) then\n            ans = ans + 1\n        else\n            j = j - 1\n        end if\n        i = i - 1\n    end do\n\n    print *, ans + i\n\n    deallocate(req)\n    deallocate(pre)\nend program codeforces_387_B\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop is a do while loop. So the code inside the loop is executed as long as i and j are >=1.\n\nThis should replicate the Java logic. Let's test it with the earlier example.\n\nTest case:\n\nn=3, m=2\n\nreq: 1 2 3\n\npre:4 5\n\nAfter processing, ans=0, i=1. ans +i=1. Which matches the Java output.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1.\n\nreq:5\n\npre:4.\n\nJava code: ans=1, i=-1. ans +i+1=1+0=1.\n\nFortran code: i=0 after loop. ans=1, ans +0=1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1.\n\nreq:3,4.\n\npre:5.\n\nJava code: after processing, i=0, ans=0. ans +0+1=1.\n\nFortran code: after loop, i=1. ans=0. ans +1=1.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be as written."
