But the Java code passes a Long a to power, which is then modified. Wait no: in Java, the power function takes a Long a, but then in the code, a is a parameter, and inside, they do a = a/10, but since Java passes by value, the original a outside isn't modified. So in the Java code, a is a copy. So in Fortran, the function can take a as an input (intent(in)), and work with a temporary variable.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main method reads two long integers, l and r. Then it calculates a maximum value 'res' based on some functions. There's a power function that counts the number of digits in a number. The mult function computes a value using the number and its complement to a 9...9 number. The maxxes array is precomputed with values based on half of 9, 99, etc., multiplied by their complement. Then the code checks if any of those midpoints are between l and r to take the maximum possible.\n\nFirst, let's think about data types. Java uses long, which is 64-bit. Fortran's equivalent would be integer(kind=8), or using the iso_fortran_env's int64. So I'll use integer(8) for variables like l, r, res, temp, etc.\n\nThe power function in Java takes a Long and returns the number of digits. In Fortran, since integers can't be passed as parameters in the same way, I'll create a function that takes an integer(8) and returns an integer. The loop divides 'a' by 10 until it's zero, incrementing the count each time.\n\nThe mult function calculates the maximum product of a number and (max - a), where max is 9...9 with the same number of digits. So for a given a, find the max 999...9 with the same digit length, then compute a*(max - a).\n\nThe main part reads input l and r. Then it precomputes maxxes array. Each element is (temp/2) * (temp - temp/2), where temp starts as 9, then 99, etc. So for each i in 0..9, temp is 10^i -1, but the loop is building temp by appending 9s. Wait, the Java loop for maxxes is:\n\ntemp starts at 0. For each i from 0 to 9:\ntemp = temp*10 +9. So first iteration i=0, temp=9, then 99, 999, etc. So for each i, temp is a 9 repeated (i+1) times. Then maxxes[i] is (temp/2) * (temp - temp/2). For example, when temp is 9, maxxes[0] =4*5=20. For 99, 49*50=2450, etc.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based. So the maxxes array in Fortran can be dimension(0:9) to match.\n\nThe main function then computes res as the maximum of mult(l), mult(r), and any of the maxxes[i] where temp/2 is between l and r.\n\nNow, translating each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the power function. In Fortran:\n\ninteger function power(a)\nimplicit none\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: a\ninteger :: res\nres = 0\ninteger(8) :: tmp\ntmp = a\ndo while (tmp > 0)\n    res = res +1\n    tmp = tmp /10\nend do\npower = res\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions can't modify their arguments, so I need to create a temporary variable. But the Java code passes a Long a to power, which is then modified. Wait no: in Java, the power function takes a Long a, but then in the code, a is a parameter, and inside, they do a = a/10, but since Java passes by value, the original a outside isn't modified. So in the Java code, a is a copy. So in Fortran, the function can take a as an input (intent(in)), and work with a temporary variable.\n\nSo for the power function in Fortran:\n\ninteger function power(a)\n    implicit none\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: a\n    integer :: res\n    integer(8) :: tmp\n    res = 0\n    tmp = a\n    do while (tmp > 0)\n        res = res + 1\n        tmp = tmp / 10\n    end do\n    power = res\nend function\n\nNext, the mult function. The Java code's mult function takes a Long a and returns a long. The Fortran version will need to return integer(8). So:\n\nfunction mult(a) result(res)\n    implicit none\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: a\n    integer(8) :: res\n    integer :: pow\n    integer(8) :: max_val, j\n\n    pow = power(a)\n    max_val = 0\n    do j = 1, pow\n        max_val = max_val * 10 +9\n    end do\n    res = a * (max_val - a)\nend function\n\nWait, but in Java's mult function, the loop runs from j=0 to pow-1, since for (int j=0; j < pow; ++j). So if pow is the number of digits, then creating a number with pow digits of 9. For example, if a is 123 (3 digits), then pow is 3, the loop runs 3 times. Each step, 0*10+9=9, then 9*10+9=99, then 99*10+9=999. So indeed, the loop runs pow times. So in Fortran, j from 1 to pow.\n\nThen, compute a*(max_val - a). So that's correct.\n\nNow the main program. In Fortran, the main program would read l and r from standard input. Let's see:\n\nprogram codeforces_86_A\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: l, r, res, temp, max_val\n    integer :: i\n    integer(8), dimension(0:9) :: maxxes\n    integer(8) :: mult\n    integer :: power\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) l, r\n\n    res = 0\n    temp = 0\n    do i = 0, 9\n        temp = temp *10 +9\n        maxxes(i) = (temp /2) * (temp - (temp /2))\n    end do\n\n    res = max(mult(l), res)\n    res = max(mult(r), res)\n\n    temp =0\n    do i=0,9\n        temp = temp *10 +9\n        if (l <= temp/2 .and. temp/2 <= r) then\n            res = max(maxxes(i), res)\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, res\n\ncontains\n\n    integer function power(a)\n        implicit none\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: a\n        integer(8) :: tmp\n        tmp = a\n        power =0\n        do while (tmp >0)\n            power = power +1\n            tmp = tmp /10\n        end do\n    end function\n\n    function mult(a) result(res)\n        implicit none\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: a\n        integer(8) :: res\n        integer :: pow, j\n        integer(8) :: max_val\n\n        pow = power(a)\n        max_val =0\n        do j=1, pow\n            max_val = max_val *10 +9\n        end do\n        res = a * (max_val -a)\n    end function\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions can be inside the program with contains. But the functions power and mult need to be declared with their return types. Also, in the main program, when we call mult(l), we need to make sure that the mult function is accessible.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the functions defined in the contains section are internal procedures and have access to the host's variables. But in this case, the functions are self-contained. The main program uses mult and power, which are part of the internal procedures.\n\nBut in the code above, I have:\n\nIn the main program, 'integer(8) :: mult' and 'integer :: power' to declare their types. But maybe that's not necessary if they are internal functions. Because in Fortran, when you have internal procedures (after contains), their interfaces are known to the host. So perhaps those declarations can be omitted.\n\nWait, but when you call a function that's declared in the contains section, the compiler knows its interface. So the main program doesn't need to declare them as variables. So perhaps the lines 'integer(8) :: mult' and 'integer :: power' are incorrect and should be removed.\n\nYes. Because in the main program, when you call mult(l), mult is a function, not a variable. Declaring 'integer(8) :: mult' would make 'mult' a variable of type integer(8), conflicting with the function name. So that's a mistake. So those lines should be removed.\n\nSo the main program should not declare mult and power as variables. Instead, their interfaces are known via the contains section.\n\nSo the corrected code would have:\n\nprogram codeforces_86_A\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: l, r, res, temp\n    integer :: i\n    integer(8), dimension(0:9) :: maxxes\n\n    read(*,*) l, r\n\n    res = 0\n    temp = 0\n    do i = 0, 9\n        temp = temp * 10 + 9\n        maxxes(i) = (temp / 2) * (temp - (temp / 2))\n    end do\n\n    res = max(mult(l), res)\n    res = max(mult(r), res)\n\n    temp = 0\n    do i = 0, 9\n        temp = temp * 10 + 9\n        if (l <= temp/2 .and. temp/2 <= r) then\n            res = max(maxxes(i), res)\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, res\n\ncontains\n\n    integer function power(a)\n        implicit none\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: a\n        integer(8) :: tmp\n        power = 0\n        tmp = a\n        do while (tmp > 0)\n            power = power + 1\n            tmp = tmp / 10\n        end do\n    end function power\n\n    function mult(a) result(res_mult)\n        implicit none\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: a\n        integer(8) :: res_mult\n        integer :: pow, j\n        integer(8) :: max_val\n\n        pow = power(a)\n        max_val = 0\n        do j = 1, pow\n            max_val = max_val * 10 + 9\n        end do\n        res_mult = a * (max_val - a)\n    end function mult\n\nend program codeforces_86_A\n\nWait, but in the mult function, the loop runs from j=1 to pow. Let's check that. For example, if pow is 3, the loop runs 3 times. Each time, max_val is multiplied by 10 and adds 9. So initial 0, then 9, then 99, then 999. That's correct.\n\nAnother thing: the Java code's mult function returns a long, which in Fortran is integer(8). So the mult function's return type is correct.\n\nIn the main program, when computing max(mult(l), res), since res is integer(8), and mult returns integer(8), the max function should handle them. But Fortran's max function for integers works as expected.\n\nNow, the maxxes array in Java is of size 10 (indices 0-9), and in Fortran, it's declared as dimension(0:9).\n\nThen, the loop after precomputing maxxes, the code checks for temp/2 in the range [l, r]. So for each i, temp is built as 9, 99, etc., then temp/2 is checked. If it's between l and r, then the corresponding maxxes[i] is considered.\n\nIn Fortran, the condition is l <= temp/2 .and. temp/2 <= r. Which is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases. For example, when l and r are 1 and 1, mult(1) would calculate the maximum 9 (since 1 has 1 digit, so max_val is 9. 1*(9-1) =8. res becomes 8. Then, check if any of the temp/2 (like 4, 49, 499, etc.) are between 1 and 1. No. So the output is 8.\n\nAnother example: l=40, r=50. The temp for i=0 is 9, temp/2=4.5, but since temp is 9 (integer division 9/2=4). So for i=0, temp/2=4, which is not between 40 and 50. For i=1, temp=99, temp/2=49. 49 is between 40 and 50. So maxxes[1] is 49*(99-49) =49*50=2450. So res would be 2450.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, translating the code accordingly. Also, note that in Fortran, integer division is done with /, which truncates towards zero. Same as Java. So temp/2 for temp=9 is 4, which matches the Java code.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code's main, after precomputing maxxes, the code computes res as the max of mult(l), res (initially 0), then max of mult(r). Then, checks the midpoints. So the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nSo putting it all together. I think the code is correct."
