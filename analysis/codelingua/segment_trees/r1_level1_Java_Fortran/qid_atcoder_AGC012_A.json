So for n iterations. In Fortran, we can loop from i=1 to n.\n\nFor each iteration in Java, head starts at 3n-2 (Java index) and decreases by 2 each time. So in Fortran, the first index is (3n-2 +1) = 3n-1. Then subtract 2 each time. So for each step, the index is 3n-1, 3n-3, ..., until n elements are summed. So for i=1 to n:\n\nindex = 3n -1 - 2*(i-1) Because for i=1: 3n-1 -0 =3n-1.\n\ni=2: 3n-1 -2=3n-3, etc. So 3n-1 - 2*(i-1) = 3n -1 -2i +2 =3n -2i +1. Wait, 3n -1 -2*(i-1) =3n-1 -2i +2=3n+1 -2i -1?

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing.\n\nThe Java code reads an integer n, then reads 3*n integers into an array. It sorts the array, then takes the second largest elements from the end in steps of two and sums them up n times. Hmm. So after sorting, the array is in ascending order. Then the code starts from the second last element (index array.length - 2) and steps back two each time, adding those elements. For example, if n is 2, then 3n is 6. After sorting, the array is from smallest to largest. Then the elements taken would be array[4], array[2], etc. Wait, let's think with an example. Suppose 3n=6 elements sorted as [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The code would take index 4 (which is 5), then 2 (which is 3), summing them if n=2. So 5+3=8. Oh right, because head starts at 3*6-2 = 4, then subtract 2 each time. So for n steps, each time taking the element at head, then head-2 each step.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to replicate this. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, read n. Then read 3n integers. Sort them. Then sum every second element starting from the second last element, for n elements.\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared. Since n can be up to 1e5 maybe? Well, the code uses int in Java, which is 32-bit. Fortran uses integer(kind=4) perhaps. But the array in Java is int, so in Fortran, integers would be default.\n\nSo first, read n. Then read 3*n integers into an array. Sort the array. Then sum the elements at positions (3n-2, 3n-4, ..., for n terms).\n\nWait, let's see. The Java array after sorting is in ascending order. So the largest elements are at the end. The code takes the second largest, then the fourth largest, etc., n times. Because for n=1, 3n=3 elements. After sorting, array[0], array[1], array[2]. Then head is 3*1*3? Wait, 3n is the array length. So when the array is length 3n, the indices go from 0 to 3n-1. The code after sorting, which sorts in ascending order. So the largest element is at 3n-1. The second largest is 3n-2. Then the code steps back two each time, so 3n-2, 3n-4, etc., for n elements. So in the sorted array, those positions correspond to the 2nd, 4th, etc., elements from the end.\n\nSo in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So when we sort the array in ascending order, the largest is at 3n. The second largest is at 3n-1. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nJava's array is 0-based. So for an array of size 3n, the indices are 0 to 3n-1. After sorting, the elements go from smallest to largest. So the largest is at index 3n-1. The second largest is 3n-2, then 3n-3 is third, etc.\n\nIn Fortran, if we declare an array of size 3n, the indices are 1 to 3n. So after sorting, the elements are in ascending order. So the largest element is at position 3n. The second largest at 3n-1. So in Java, the head starts at 3n-2 (array.length is 3n, so array.length-2 is 3n-2, which is the index). In Fortran, that element would be at 3n-1. Because in Java's array index 3n-2 is the (3n-2 +1)th position in Fortran. Wait, no. Let's see: Java index 0 is Fortran 1, Java index 1 is Fortran 2, ..., Java index k is Fortran k+1. So Java's array[3n-2] is Fortran's array(3n-1). Because 3n-2 +1 =3n-1. So to get the same element in Fortran as the Java code, the head starts at 3n-1 in the Fortran array.\n\nThen, each step, we subtract 2 from the head. So the next element would be at 3n-1 -2 = 3n-3. Wait, but in Java, head starts at 3n-2, then subtracts 2 each step. So the positions in Java are 3n-2, 3n-4, etc. Which in Fortran are (3n-1), (3n-3), etc. So for each step, head in Fortran starts at 3n-1, then 3n-3, ..., for n steps.\n\nSo the sum is the sum of those elements.\n\nNow, in Fortran, reading the inputs. The user inputs n, then 3n integers. So first read n. Then read 3n integers.\n\nIn Fortran, for dynamic arrays, we can allocate them. Let's see. So code outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i\n    integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n    integer(kind=8) :: res  ! Because in Java, res is a long, which is 64-bit integer\n    read *, n\n    allocate(array(3*n))\n    read *, (array(i), i=1, 3*n)\n    call sort(array)\n    res = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        res = res + array(3*n - 2*i +1 -1) ? Wait, maybe I need to compute the index.\n\nWait, let's think again. For the first step (i=0 in Java's loop, but in Fortran, loops are typically 1-based), so in Java, the loop runs from i=0 to i<n-1. Wait, the Java loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++). So for n iterations.\n\nIn Fortran, we can loop from i=1 to n.\n\nFor each iteration in Java, head starts at 3n-2 (Java index) and decreases by 2 each time.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first index is (3n-2 +1) = 3n-1. Then subtract 2 each time. So for each step, the index is 3n-1, 3n-3, ..., until n elements are summed.\n\nSo for i=1 to n:\n\nindex = 3n -1 - 2*(i-1)\n\nBecause for i=1: 3n-1 -0 =3n-1.\n\ni=2: 3n-1 -2=3n-3, etc.\n\nSo 3n-1 - 2*(i-1) = 3n -1 -2i +2 =3n -2i +1.\n\nWait, 3n -1 -2*(i-1) =3n-1 -2i +2=3n+1 -2i -1? Wait, let me compute:\n\nWait, 3n-1 - 2*(i-1) = 3n-1 -2i +2 =3n-1+2 -2i =3n+1-2i. Hmm, no. Let's see:\n\nWait 3n-1 minus 2*(i-1) is 3n-1 -2i +2 =3n+1 -2i.\n\nWait, no. Because 2*(i-1) =2i-2. So subtract that from (3n-1):\n\n3n-1 - (2i-2) =3n-1-2i +2=3n+1-2i.\n\nSo the index is 3n+1-2i.\n\nWait, but for n=1, 3n=3. Then for i=1, index is 3*1+1 -2*1=4-2=2. But wait, in Java, for 3n=3, the array is 0..2. head starts at 1 (3n-2=3*1-2=1). So Java index 1, which is Fortran index 2. So in Fortran, when n=1, i=1, 3n+1-2i=3+1-2=2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the index in Fortran is 3n +1 -2i.\n\nSo the code in Fortran would sum array(3n +1 -2i) for i from 1 to n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the loop:\n\ndo i=1, n\n    res = res + array(3*n +1 -2*i)\nend do\n\nNow, the next part is sorting the array. Fortran has a built-in sort function, but it's not part of the standard. However, for the purposes of code submission, we can use a simple implementation. Alternatively, use a sorting subroutine. However, the easiest way is to sort the array in ascending order. Let's see.\n\nIn Java, Arrays.sort(array) sorts the array in ascending order. So we need to sort the Fortran array in ascending order.\n\nIn Fortran, one approach is to use the intrinsic function, but I recall that the sort function may not be standard. So perhaps the user has to implement a sort, or use a library. But in code submission, it's common to use the intrinsic functions if possible.\n\nAlternatively, use a simple bubble sort or quick sort. But given that 3n can be up to 3e5 (if n is 1e5), bubble sort would be too slow. So we need an efficient sort. So perhaps using the Fortran's 'sort' function from the intrinsic module. Wait, but I think Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function. So perhaps the user has to implement it or use an external library.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the GNU Fortran's sort, but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, use the quicksort algorithm.\n\nBut for code translation, perhaps the easiest way is to sort the array in ascending order.\n\nWait, the original code in Java sorts the array in ascending order, so in Fortran, we need to do the same.\n\nLet's proceed with the code.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Allocate array with size 3n.\n\n3. Read 3n integers into array.\n\n4. Sort array in ascending order.\n\n5. Compute the sum of array elements at positions (3n-1, 3n-3, ..., 3n-1 -2*(n-1)), which is n elements.\n\nFor the sorting part, in Fortran, perhaps the easiest way is to use the quicksort algorithm. But implementing it in Fortran is a bit tedious.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran 2008's 'sort' function from the intrinsic module, but I'm not sure. Maybe the user has to implement it.\n\nAlternatively, use a library like the intrinsic module's sort. But in practice, in code submission, perhaps the user is allowed to use the 'sort' function from the 'iso_fortran_env' module. Wait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'SORT' intrinsic function. Wait, no. Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to implement a quick sort subroutine.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps use a simple approach. Let's think about writing a quick sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that Java's Arrays.sort() uses a dual-pivot quicksort for primitives, but for code translation, perhaps use a simple sort.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a bubble sort. But that's O(n^2), which would be too slow for large n. For example, if n is 1e5, then 3n is 3e5 elements. Bubble sort would be O( (3e5)^2 ) which is 9e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo the code would need an efficient sort. So the user would need to implement a quick sort in Fortran.\n\nSo, let's proceed to implement a quick sort.\n\nBut for code brevity, perhaps it's better to use the Fortran's 'sort' function if available, but I think that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, use a workaround: use the 'reshape' and 'pack' functions. But I don't think that helps.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function from the 'm_stdlib' library, but that's not part of standard Fortran.\n\nSo given that, perhaps the code must include a quick sort implementation.\n\nSo the code would have a recursive or iterative quick sort routine.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps the code can sort the array using the 'sort' subroutine.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nFirst, the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i\n    integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n    integer(kind=8) :: res\n    read *, n\n    allocate(array(3*n))\n    read *, (array(i), i=1, 3*n)\n    call quicksort(array, 1, 3*n)\n    res = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        res = res + array(3*n + 1 - 2*i)\n    end do\n    print *, res\ncontains\n    subroutine quicksort(...)\n    ...\nend program\n\nBut implementing quicksort in Fortran is needed.\n\nAlternatively, use the insertion sort for the purpose of code translation, but that's not efficient.\n\nBut perhaps for the sake of code translation, the user can use a built-in sort. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the code can use the 'sort' function from the 'sort_mod' module, but again, that's not standard.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. How to sort an array in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' intrinsic function of some compilers, but that's not portable.\n\nBut the original code uses Arrays.sort, which sorts in ascending order.\n\nSo for the Fortran code, perhaps implement a simple quick sort.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of quicksort in Fortran.\n\nRecursive subroutine quicksort(a, first, last)\n    implicit none\n    integer, intent(inout) :: a(:)\n    integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n    integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n    if (first < last) then\n        pivot = a(first)\n        i = first\n        j = last\n        do\n            do while (a(i) < pivot)\n                i = i + 1\n            end do\n            do while (a(j) > pivot)\n                j = j - 1\n            end do\n            if (i >= j) exit\n            temp = a(i)\n            a(i) = a(j)\n            a(j) = temp\n            i = i + 1\n            j = j - 1\n        end do\n        call quicksort(a, first, j)\n        call quicksort(a, j+1, last)\n    end if\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nBut this implementation may have issues. Let's test with a small array.\n\nFor example, array [3,1,2], first=1, last=3.\n\npivot is 3. Then i starts at 1, checks a(1) < 3? No. Then j starts at 3, checks a(3) >3? 2>3? No. So swap a(1) and a(3) \u2192 [2,1,3]. Then i becomes 2, j becomes 2. Since i >=j, exit. Then call quicksort on first=1, j=2 \u2192 [2,1,3]. Then call quicksort on 3,3 (no-op). Then the left part: first=1, last=2. pivot=2. i=1, a(1)=2 >= pivot. j=2, a(2)=1 < pivot. So swap a(1) and a(2) \u2192 [1,2,3]. Then i=2, j=1. Exit. Recursively call quicksort on first=1, j=1 (no-op), and j+1=2, last=2 (no-op). So array becomes [1,2,3]. So it works.\n\nBut the code may have some issues for certain cases, but for the purpose of this translation, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nSo the Fortran code would include this quicksort subroutine.\n\nAlternatively, use a different pivot selection, but for code brevity, perhaps the first element as pivot.\n\nSo the code would include this quicksort subroutine.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut wait, in the quicksort subroutine, the 'a' array is modified in place. So in the main program, after calling call quicksort(array, 1, 3*n), the array is sorted in ascending order.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i\n    integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n    integer(kind=8) :: res\n    read *, n\n    allocate(array(3*n))\n    read *, (array(i), i=1, 3*n)\n    call quicksort(array, 1, 3*n)\n    res = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        res = res + array(3*n + 1 - 2*i)\n    end do\n    print *, res\ncontains\n    recursive subroutine quicksort(a, first, last)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: a(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n        integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n        if (first < last) then\n            pivot = a(first)\n            i = first\n            j = last\n            do\n                do while (a(i) < pivot)\n                    i = i + 1\n                end do\n                do while (a(j) > pivot)\n                    j = j - 1\n                end do\n                if (i >= j) exit\n                temp = a(i)\n                a(i) = a(j)\n                a(j) = temp\n                i = i + 1\n                j = j - 1\n            end do\n            call quicksort(a, first, j)\n            call quicksort(a, j+1, last)\n        end if\n    end subroutine quicksort\nend program main\n\nWait, but there's a problem here. The quicksort subroutine is declared as taking a(:), but when called from the main program, the actual argument is array, which is an allocatable array. But in Fortran, the dummy argument is assumed-shape, and the actual array must be explicit-shape or assumed-size. But when passed to a subroutine, it's okay.\n\nBut the quicksort subroutine's dummy argument is a(:), which is a one-dimensional array. So the code should work.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nFor example, if the input is:\n\n2\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nThen the array after sorting is [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Then the sum is array(6+1 -2*1) =6+1-2=5 \u2192 index 5, which is 5, then for i=2, 6+1 -4=3 \u2192 index 3, which is 3. So sum is 5+3=8. Which matches the Java code.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, input 3 numbers, say 3 1 2. After sorting, [1,2,3]. The sum is array(3+1-2*1) =4-2=2 \u2192 index 2, which is 2. So output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when n=0? Well, the original Java code uses n as the input, which must be a positive integer. But according to the problem statement, probably n is at least 1.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, regarding the data types. The res variable in Java is a long, which is 64-bit. In Fortran, using integer(kind=8) ensures that it's 64-bit. So the sum can be large, but with 64-bit integers, it should handle it.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
