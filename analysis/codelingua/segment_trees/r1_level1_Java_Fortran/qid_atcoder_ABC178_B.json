    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's look at the Java code first. The main part is reading four long integers and then computing the maximum product among some combinations. The rest of the code seems to be helper classes and methods that aren't used in the main method. So the actual code I need to translate is the main method part.\n\nThe Java code reads four numbers into an array a. Then it calculates the maximum between a[0]*a[2], a[1]*a[3], a[0]*a[3], and a[1]*a[2], and prints the maximum.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to read four integers (probably as 64-bit integers if Java's long is 64-bit). Then compute those products and find the maximum.\n\nSo first, how to read input in Fortran. The Java code uses a FastReader class for input, but in Fortran, we can read from standard input using read statements. Since the input is four space-separated numbers, we can read them into an array or four variables.\n\nThen compute the products. Let's see: the products are a0*a2, a1*a3, a0*a3, a1*a2. Then take the max of all four.\n\nIn Fortran, the max function can take multiple arguments. Wait, but Fortran's max function can take multiple arguments but only returns the maximum of two. Wait, no. Wait, the Fortran intrinsic function MAX can take multiple arguments and returns the maximum value among them. For example, MAX(1,2,3) gives 3. So yes, we can chain the max function.\n\nSo, the Fortran code would look like:\n\nRead a, b, c, d (assuming the four numbers are in order a, b, c, d). Wait, no. The original Java code reads four numbers into a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]. Then computes a[0]*a[2] (indexes 0 and 2), which are the first and third numbers. Similarly, others. So in Fortran, if I read the four numbers into variables a, b, c, d, then the products would be a*c, b*d, a*d, b*c.\n\nSo the max would be the maximum of these four products.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\n- Read four integers as a, b, c, d. But wait, in Fortran, the variables would need to be declared. Since Java uses long, which is 64-bit, in Fortran, we should use integer(kind=8) to represent them.\n\nWait, but Fortran's default integer kind may vary. So to make sure they are 64-bit, we can use integer(8) or use selected_int_kind to get the appropriate kind. Alternatively, if the problem constraints allow, maybe 32-bit is enough, but since the original code uses long, we should use 64-bit integers.\n\nSo variables should be declared as integer(8) :: a, b, c, d.\n\nThen compute the four products and take the maximum.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\n1. Read four integers from input.\n\nIn Fortran, to read from standard input, we can use read(*,*) a, b, c, d. This reads from the standard input, splitting by whitespace.\n\n2. Compute the four products: a*c, b*d, a*d, b*c.\n\n3. Compute the maximum of these four values.\n\nThen print the maximum.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: a, b, c, d\n    integer(8) :: max_val\n    read(*,*) a, b, c, d\n    max_val = max(a*c, b*d, a*d, b*c)\n    print *, max_val\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when using max with more than two arguments, you have to chain them. Wait, no, Fortran's max function can take multiple arguments. Let me check: the MAX function in Fortran returns the maximum of all its arguments. So MAX(A1, A2, ..., An) is allowed.\n\nYes, so the code is correct.\n\nSo the Java code reads four numbers and outputs the maximum of those four products. The Fortran code does the same.\n\nI think that's the correct translation. The helper classes in the Java code (FastReader, modPower, pair) are not used in the main method, so they can be omitted.\n\nTesting this with sample input would be good. For example, if input is 1 2 3 4, then the products are 1*3=3, 2*4=8, 1*4=4, 2*3=6. The maximum is 8. So the output should be 8. The code should compute that.\n\nAnother test case: input 0 0 0 0 \u2192 maximum is 0.\n\nAnother test case: input -1 -2 -3 -4 \u2192 products are (-1)*(-3)=3, (-2)*(-4)=8, (-1)*(-4)=4, (-2)*(-3)=6. Max is 8. So code should output 8.\n\nSo the code seems correct."
