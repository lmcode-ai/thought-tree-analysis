But in Fortran, the array indices start from 1 by default.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of an array of integers, then computes a sum involving modular inverses. The main steps are:\n\n1. Read input N and array A.\n2. Compute LCM of all elements in A using BigInteger for handling large numbers.\n3. Compute the sum of (LCM / A_i) mod 1e9+7 for each element A_i, using modular arithmetic to avoid division.\n\nFortran doesn't have built-in arbitrary-precision integers like Java's BigInteger, so handling LCM for large numbers could be an issue. But since the LCM is eventually taken modulo 1e9+7, maybe we can compute the LCM modulo that number during the calculation. Wait, but LCM is a product divided by GCDs, so maybe we can compute it modulo the modulus. Hmm, but I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, the problem is that the LCM could be very large, even bigger than what Fortran's 64-bit integers can handle. But in Java, they used BigInteger. How can I replicate this in Fortran?\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor each number into primes and compute the maximum exponents for each prime factor. Then reconstruct the LCM modulo 1e9+7. That's a possible approach, but factorizing each number could be time-consuming for large N. But given that N is up to 1e5 (maybe), but perhaps in the problem constraints, the numbers are manageable. Let me check the original problem.\n\nThe original problem is AtCoder ABC152 E. Looking up, the problem requires computing the LCM of all A_i, then summing LCM / A_i modulo 1e9+7. The constraints are N up to 1e4 or 1e5, and A_i up to 1e6. So factorizing each A_i into primes is feasible, perhaps.\n\nBut in the Java code, the LCM is computed directly using the formula LCM = LCM * a / GCD(LCM, a). So in Fortran, we need to handle this step. However, using integers for LCM might overflow. So the Java code uses BigInteger to handle arbitrary size. In Fortran, without such a type, perhaps we can compute the LCM modulo MOD, but that's not straightforward. Wait, because the LCM is being multiplied by a_i and divided by GCD. But since the division is exact (since LCM is the LCM), maybe we can compute the LCM modulo MOD * something. Hmm, but this approach might not work because division in modular arithmetic isn't straightforward unless we can compute the inverse.\n\nWait, the problem here is that the Java code computes the LCM as an exact integer, then takes mod 1e9+7. So if the LCM is very large, even beyond 64 bits, but the modulo is applied after the entire LCM is computed. So in Fortran, if the LCM exceeds the maximum integer size, it will overflow and give incorrect results. So how to handle this?\n\nAlternative approach: use the prime factorization method. For each A_i, factor into primes. For each prime, keep track of the highest exponent in any A_i. Then the LCM is the product of primes^max_exponents. Then, compute this product modulo 1e9+7. This way, we can compute each prime's contribution modulo 1e9+7 and multiply them all together. This avoids dealing with very large numbers.\n\nBut factorizing each number might be time-consuming. Let's see: for numbers up to 1e6, trial division is manageable. Precompute primes up to 1e3 (since sqrt(1e6) is 1e3) and use that for trial division. Alternatively, use a sieve to precompute primes, but even trial division per number would be O(sqrt(n)) per number. For A_i up to 1e6 and N up to 1e5, this might be feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each A_i, compute its prime factors and their exponents.\n2. For each prime, track the maximum exponent across all A_i.\n3. Compute the LCM as the product of (prime^max_exponent) mod MOD, where MOD is 1e9+7.\n4. Then, for each A_i, compute (LCM / A_i) mod MOD. But since division in modulo arithmetic requires multiplying by the modular inverse of A_i mod MOD. But since LCM is a multiple of A_i, LCM/A_i is an integer. So (LCM mod MOD) * inverse(A_i mod MOD) mod MOD would be equivalent to (LCM/A_i) mod MOD. Because (LCM/A_i) = k, and k * A_i = LCM. So when mod MOD, k mod MOD * A_i mod MOD = LCM mod MOD. So k mod MOD is (LCM mod MOD) * inv(A_i mod MOD) mod MOD.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n- Precompute all primes up to 1e6 using sieve (optional, but trial division might be easier here).\n- For each A_i, factor into primes, track max exponents.\n- Compute LCM mod MOD as product of (p^e) mod MOD for each prime p with max exponent e.\n- For each A_i, compute (LCM mod MOD) * modinv(A_i, MOD) mod MOD, sum all these.\n\nBut the challenge is factorizing each A_i efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, compute the LCM using the same method as the Java code but using big integers. However, Fortran doesn't have arbitrary-precision integers. So this approach isn't feasible unless we use a big integer library, which isn't standard in Fortran.\n\nSo the only feasible approach is to compute the LCM via prime factorization.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, read N and the array A.\n\nThen, for each A_i, compute its prime factors and exponents.\n\nFor factorization, create a function that takes an integer and returns a dictionary (or a list) of primes and their exponents.\n\nBut in Fortran, we can use a hash map or a derived type to track the primes and their max exponents. Alternatively, use an array where the index represents the prime and the value is the max exponent. But since primes can be up to 1e6, this array would be too large. So perhaps a list of primes and their exponents.\n\nWait, but in practice, each A_i is up to 1e6, so the primes in their factorization are up to 1e6. So the maximum possible prime is 1e6.\n\nAlternatively, create a dictionary-like structure using a list of primes and their max exponents.\n\nSo, here's how to proceed:\n\n1. Initialize a list (or a hash map) to keep track of the maximum exponent for each prime.\n\n2. For each number in A:\n\n   a. Factorize it into primes and their exponents.\n\n   b. For each prime in the factorization, compare its exponent with the current max in the list, and update if necessary.\n\n3. Once all numbers are processed, compute the product of (prime^max_exponent) mod MOD. This is the LCM mod MOD.\n\n4. Then, compute the sum over all A_i of (LCM * inv(A_i)) mod MOD.\n\nBut factorizing each A_i is the main task. Let's think about factorization.\n\nImplement a trial division method for each A_i:\n\nFor each a in A, if a is 1, skip (since primes are >=2). Else, for each possible divisor from 2 up to sqrt(a). For each divisor, check if it divides a, and count the exponent.\n\nAlternatively, precompute primes up to 1e3 (since sqrt(1e6) is 1e3) using sieve of Eratosthenes, then trial divide by these primes first, then check if the remaining number is a prime.\n\nThis would speed up the factorization.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps for the code, it's easier to write a trial division function.\n\nSo, let's outline the code structure.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n- Read N.\n\n- Read A as an array.\n\n- For each a in A:\n\n   if a is 1, skip (as it contributes nothing to LCM).\n\n   else, factor into primes.\n\n   for each prime factor p with exponent e:\n\n      if current max exponent for p is less than e, update to e.\n\n- After processing all A, compute the LCM mod MOD: product of p^e mod MOD for each prime p in the map.\n\nThen compute the sum for each a in A:\n\nsum += (LCM_mod * modinv(a, MOD)) mod MOD.\n\nBut modinv(a, MOD) can be computed using Fermat's little theorem since MOD is prime (1e9+7 is prime), so modinv is a^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. Factor each number into primes.\n\n2. Track the maximum exponent for each prime.\n\n3. Compute LCM mod MOD.\n\n4. Compute sum over (LCM mod MOD * inv(a) mod MOD).\n\nNow, let's tackle each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, factorization.\n\nImplement a function to factor a number into primes. Let's write a subroutine.\n\nsubroutine factor(n, factors)\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable, intent(out) :: factors_primes, factors_exponents\n    integer :: temp, p, cnt\n\n    temp = n\n    allocate(factors_primes(0), factors_exponents(0))\n\n    if (temp == 1) return\n\n    p = 2\n    do while (p * p <= temp)\n        if (mod(temp, p) == 0) then\n            cnt = 0\n            do while (mod(temp, p) == 0)\n                cnt = cnt + 1\n                temp = temp / p\n            end do\n            factors_primes = [factors_primes, p]\n            factors_exponents = [factors_exponents, cnt]\n        end if\n        p = p + 1\n    end do\n\n    if (temp > 1) then\n        factors_primes = [factors_primes, temp]\n        factors_exponents = [factors_exponents, 1]\n    end if\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in Fortran, dynamically appending to arrays is possible with the intrinsic move_alloc, but it's a bit involved. Alternatively, for each a in A, after factorization, process each prime and exponent and update the global max exponents.\n\nBut handling dynamic data structures in Fortran is a bit tricky. Another approach: use a dictionary-like structure where for each prime, we track the maximum exponent. For this, perhaps use a list of primes and their exponents, stored in a derived type.\n\nAlternatively, use a module-level array where the index is the prime and the value is the exponent. But primes can be up to 1e6, so the array size would be 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nBut 1e6 elements is not too big. So in Fortran:\n\nmodule primes_module\n    integer, parameter :: max_prime = 10**6\n    integer, dimension(max_prime) :: max_exponents = 0\nend module primes_module\n\nBut in the factorization, for each prime in the factors, we check if max_exponents(prime) is less than the current exponent, and update if so.\n\nBut in Fortran, the array indices start from 1 by default. Wait, but primes start from 2. So if the array is dimensioned as (2:max_prime), but that's not possible. So the array will be from 1 to max_prime. But primes start from 2, so entries for 1 and primes > max_prime will be unused. But max_prime is 1e6, which is sufficient for the primes in any A_i up to 1e6.\n\nWait, if A_i can be up to 1e6, then their prime factors can't be larger than 1e6. For example, if a number is 1e6 and is prime, then its largest prime factor is 1e6. So the array needs to be large enough to hold primes up to 1e6.\n\nThus, declaring max_exponents(1:1e6) is feasible.\n\nBut the problem is that for numbers up to 1e6, their prime factors can't exceed 1e6. So this approach is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize an array max_exponents of size 1e6, all zeros.\n\n- For each a in A:\n\n   if a is 1, continue.\n\n   else, factor a into primes and exponents.\n\n   for each (p, e) in factors:\n\n      if max_exponents(p) < e, set max_exponents(p) = e.\n\nOnce all a are processed, compute LCM_mod as the product of p^max_exponents(p) for all p where max_exponents(p) > 0, modulo MOD.\n\nThen, for each a_i in A:\n\ncompute term = (LCM_mod * modinv(a_i, MOD)) mod MOD\n\nsum = (sum + term) mod MOD\n\nNow, the challenge is factorizing a_i into primes and exponents.\n\nImplementing the factorization in Fortran:\n\nFor a given a, check divisibility by 2 first, then odd numbers up to sqrt(a).\n\nBut this can be done with a loop.\n\nBut let's code this.\n\nsubroutine factor(n, primes, exponents)\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable, intent(out) :: primes, exponents\n    integer :: temp, p, cnt, i\n\n    temp = n\n    primes = []\n    exponents = []\n\n    if (temp == 1) return\n\n    ! Check divisibility by 2\n    if (mod(temp, 2) == 0) then\n        cnt = 0\n        do while (mod(temp, 2) == 0)\n            cnt = cnt + 1\n            temp = temp / 2\n        end do\n        primes = [primes, 2]\n        exponents = [exponents, cnt]\n    end if\n\n    ! Check odd numbers from 3 to sqrt(temp)\n    p = 3\n    do while (p * p <= temp)\n        if (mod(temp, p) == 0) then\n            cnt = 0\n            do while (mod(temp, p) == 0)\n                cnt = cnt + 1\n                temp = temp / p\n            end do\n            primes = [primes, p]\n            exponents = [exponents, cnt]\n        end if\n        p = p + 2\n    end do\n\n    ! If remaining temp is a prime > 2\n    if (temp > 1) then\n        primes = [primes, temp]\n        exponents = [exponents, 1]\n    end if\nend subroutine\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamically building arrays like [primes, p] is not straightforward. Fortran requires the use of move_alloc to resize arrays. So here's how to handle that:\n\nsubroutine factor(n, primes, exponents)\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable, intent(out) :: primes, exponents\n    integer :: temp, p, cnt, i\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: tmp_primes, tmp_exponents\n\n    temp = n\n    allocate(primes(0), exponents(0)) ! Initialize as empty\n\n    if (temp == 1) return\n\n    ! Check for 2\n    if (mod(temp, 2) == 0) then\n        cnt = 0\n        do while (mod(temp, 2) == 0)\n            cnt = cnt + 1\n            temp = temp / 2\n        end do\n        call add_prime(2, cnt, primes, exponents)\n    end if\n\n    ! Check odd factors\n    p = 3\n    do while (p <= temp .and. p*p <= temp)\n        if (mod(temp, p) == 0) then\n            cnt = 0\n            do while (mod(temp, p) == 0)\n                cnt = cnt + 1\n                temp = temp / p\n            end do\n            call add_prime(p, cnt, primes, exponents)\n        end if\n        p = p + 2\n    end do\n\n    ! Check if remaining temp is prime\n    if (temp > 1) then\n        call add_prime(temp, 1, primes, exponents)\n    end if\n\nend subroutine\n\nsubroutine add_prime(p, e, primes, exponents)\n    integer, intent(in) :: p, e\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable, intent(inout) :: primes, exponents\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: tmp\n\n    allocate(tmp(size(primes) + 1))\n    tmp(1:size(primes)) = primes\n    tmp(size(primes)+1) = p\n    call move_alloc(tmp, primes)\n\n    allocate(tmp(size(exponents) + 1))\n    tmp(1:size(exponents)) = exponents\n    tmp(size(exponents)+1) = e\n    call move_alloc(tmp, exponents)\nend subroutine\n\nThis way, each time a new prime is found, it's added to the primes and exponents arrays.\n\nOnce all primes and exponents are collected for a number, we iterate through them and update the global max_exponents array.\n\nNow, the code would:\n\n- For each a in A:\n\n   if a == 1: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      factor into primes and exponents.\n\n      for each prime p and exponent e in factors:\n\n          if max_exponents(p) < e:\n\n              max_exponents(p) = e\n\nOnce all a are processed, compute the LCM mod MOD.\n\nTo compute the LCM mod MOD, iterate through all primes p where max_exponents(p) > 0, compute p^e mod MOD, and multiply all these together mod MOD.\n\nBut how to efficiently compute p^e mod MOD? Use modular exponentiation.\n\nIn Fortran, a function to compute (base^exponent) mod modval:\n\nfunction mod_pow(base, exponent, modval) result(res)\n    integer, intent(in) :: base, exponent, modval\n    integer :: res\n    integer :: b, e, x\n\n    res = 1\n    b = mod(base, modval)\n    e = exponent\n    x = b\n\n    do while (e > 0)\n        if (mod(e, 2) == 1) then\n            res = mod(res * x, modval)\n        end if\n        x = mod(x * x, modval)\n        e = e / 2\n    end do\nend function mod_pow\n\nBut in Fortran, integers can be up to 64-bit. Since MOD is 1e9+7, squaring x may be up to (1e9+7)^2, which is 1e18+2e9+49, which is beyond 32-bit integers. So we need to use 64-bit integers.\n\nTherefore, in the code, declare variables as integer(kind=8) to handle large numbers.\n\nSo, the mod_pow function should use 64-bit integers.\n\nSo modifying:\n\nfunction mod_pow(base, exponent, modval) result(res)\n    integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: base, exponent, modval\n    integer(kind=8) :: res\n    integer(kind=8) :: b, e, x\n\n    res = 1_8\n    b = mod(base, modval)\n    e = exponent\n    x = b\n\n    do while (e > 0)\n        if (mod(e, 2_8) == 1_8) then\n            res = mod(res * x, modval)\n        end if\n        x = mod(x * x, modval)\n        e = e / 2_8\n    end do\nend function mod_pow\n\nBut Fortran's kind=8 might not be available; alternatively, use selected_int_kind to get the right kind. But for simplicity, assuming integer(kind=8) is 64 bits.\n\nNow, the LCM mod MOD is computed by multiplying each p^max_exponents(p) mod MOD.\n\nThen, for each a_i, compute (LCM mod MOD) * modinv(a_i, MOD) mod MOD.\n\nmodinv can be computed via mod_pow(a_i, MOD-2, MOD), since MOD is prime.\n\nThus, the sum is:\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i=1,N\n    a = A(i)\n    inv_a = mod_pow(a, MOD-2, MOD)\n    term = mod(lcm_mod * inv_a, MOD)\n    sum = mod(sum + term, MOD)\nend do\n\nBut note that a_i may be 0, but in the problem constraints, a_i is >=1. So no division by zero.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\n1. Read N and A.\n\n2. Initialize max_exponents array (size 1e6) to 0.\n\n3. For each a in A:\n\n   a. If a is 1, skip.\n\n   b. Factor a into primes and exponents.\n\n   c. For each (p, e) in factors, update max_exponents(p) to max(max_exponents(p), e).\n\n4. Compute LCM_mod:\n\n   lcm_mod = 1\n\n   do p=2,1e6\n\n       if (max_exponents(p) > 0) then\n\n           lcm_mod = mod(lcm_mod * mod_pow(int(p,8), max_exponents(p), MOD), MOD)\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\nBut wait, p could be up to 1e6. So in the code, we loop through all possible primes p from 2 to 1e6 where max_exponents(p) is >0.\n\nBut that's time-consuming. Alternatively, collect all primes p where max_exponents(p) >0 and loop through them.\n\nBut how to collect them? For each p from 2 to 1e6, check if max_exponents(p) >0. For 1e6 elements, this loop is manageable.\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo p = 2, max_prime\n\n    if (max_exponents(p) > 0) then\n\n        lcm_mod = mod(lcm_mod * mod_pow(int(p,8), max_exponents(p), MOD), MOD)\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nBut max_prime is 1e6. This loop will run 1e6 times, which is acceptable for Fortran.\n\nBut considering that mod_pow is called for each p with max_exponents(p) >0, which for large N could be O(1e6) steps. But for N up to 1e5, and each a_i up to 1e6, the total number of primes is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the factorization, track all primes that are part of any factorization, and store them in a list. Then, iterate through this list when computing LCM_mod. This would be more efficient.\n\nBut in the code as written, the max_exponents array is indexed by primes, and we need to loop through all primes up to 1e6. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\nprogram ABC152_E\n    implicit none\n\n    integer, parameter :: MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    integer, parameter :: max_prime = 10**6\n    integer(kind=8) :: lcm_mod, sum, inv_a, term, mod_pow_result\n    integer :: N, i, p, e, a, j\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: A\n    integer, dimension(max_prime) :: max_exponents = 0\n\n    !

The factor subroutine uses temp as integer, but if a is up to 1e6, then temp can be up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\n2. The add_to_factors subroutine uses allocatable arrays. But in Fortran, when you assign tmp = primes, you need to have the same allocation status. So perhaps use move_alloc to manage the arrays.\n\nWait, the code in add_to_factors is:\n\nsubroutine add_to_factors(p, e, primes, exponents)\n    ...\n    tmp = primes\n    deallocate(primes)\n    allocate(primes(size(tmp)+1))\n    ... etc.\n\nBut this will not work in Fortran because when you assign tmp = primes, if primes is allocated, tmp will become allocated with the same size. But when you deallocate primes, tmp remains allocated. Then you can copy into primes.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use move_alloc.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be written as:\n\nsubroutine add_to_factors(p, e, primes, exponents)\n    integer, intent(in) :: p, e\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable, intent(inout) :: primes, exponents\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: tmp_p, tmp_e\n\n    ! Add to primes\n    call move_alloc(primes, tmp_p)\n    allocate(primes(size(tmp_p)+1))\n    primes(1:size(tmp_p)) = tmp_p\n    primes(size(tmp_p)+1) = p\n    deallocate(tmp_p)\n\n    ! Add to exponents\n    call move_alloc(exponents, tmp_e)\n    allocate(exponents(size(tmp_e)+1))\n    exponents(1:size(tmp_e)) = tmp_e\n    exponents(size(tmp_e)+1) = e\n    deallocate(tmp_e)\nend subroutine\n\nThis way, move_alloc transfers the allocation from primes to tmp_p, then allocate primes with size+1. This is more efficient.\n\nSo modifying the add_to_factors subroutine to use move_alloc.\n\nThus, the factor subroutine and add_to_factors would need to be adjusted.\n\nAlso, in the factor subroutine, the loop for p:\n\n    p = 3\n    do while (p*p <= temp)\n        if (mod(temp, p) == 0) then\n            ...\n        end if\n        p = p + 2\n    end do\n\nBut temp is changing as factors are divided out. So the loop should check p*p <= temp, but temp decreases over time. So this code should be okay.\n\nAnother possible issue is when temp becomes 1, then the loop would exit. But after the loop, if temp>1, then it's a prime factor.\n\nNow, testing with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n2 3 4\n\nSample Output: 13\n\nProcessing:\n\nA = [2,3,4]\n\nFactor 2: primes [2], exponents [1]\n\nFactor 3: primes [3], exponents [1]\n\nFactor 4: primes [2], exponents [2]\n\nmax_exponents:\n\n2: max(1, 2) \u2192 2\n\n3: max(1) \u2192 1\n\nLCM = 2^2 *3^1 =4*3=12 \u2192 12 mod 1e9+7=12.\n\nsum = (12/2)+(12/3)+(12/4) mod 1e9+7 \u2192 6+4+3=13.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nLet's see how the code would process this.\n\nFor each a=2:\n\nfactors are [2], exponents [1]. max_exponents[2] becomes 1.\n\na=3: factors [3], exponents [1]. max_exponents[3] becomes 1.\n\na=4: factors [2], exponents 2. max_exponents[2] becomes 2.\n\nThen LCM_mod is 2^2 *3^1 mod MOD \u2192 4*3=12.\n\nsum for each a:\n\na=2: term =12 * inv(2) \u2192 inv(2) is 500000004. 12*500000004 mod MOD is 6.\n\na=3: term=12 * 333333336 mod MOD \u21924.\n\na=4: term=12 * 250000002 mod MOD \u21923.\n\nSum is 13.\n\nThus, the code would output 13.\n\nAnother sample: \n\nInput:\n2\n100000 100000\n\nThe LCM is 100000. Then sum is (100000/100000) + (100000/100000) mod MOD \u2192 1+1=2.\n\nBut let's see how the code handles it. Factor 100000 \u2192 2^5 *5^5.\n\nSo max_exponents[2]=5, max_exponents[5]=5.\n\nLCM_mod = 2^5 *5^5 mod MOD.\n\n2^5=32, 5^5=3125 \u219232*3125=100000. mod 1e9+7 is 100000.\n\ninv(100000) mod MOD is 100000^(MOD-2) mod MOD. sum is (100000 * inv(100000) ) *2 \u2192 2.\n\nSo code would output 2.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge case: a_i=1.\n\nFor example, input:\n\n1\n\n1\n\nThe LCM is 1. sum is 1/1 mod MOD \u21921.\n\nThe code:\n\nWhen a=1, the factorization returns empty. So max_exponents remains all zero. Then LCM_mod is product of primes with max_exponents>0, which is 1 (since product of zero terms is 1). Then sum is 1 * inv(1) mod MOD \u21921.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: a=1 is part of the array.\n\nThus, the code should handle this correctly.\n\nNow, possible issues in the code:\n\n1. The max_prime is set to 1e6. But if a number in A is a prime larger than 1e6, then the code will crash. But in the code, during factorization, if a number is factorized into a prime larger than 1e6, then in the update_max_exponents subroutine, p will be greater than max_prime, which triggers an error. But according to the problem statement, the original Java code can handle numbers up to any size, but in Fortran, the code would fail if any a_i has a prime factor larger than 1e6. To handle this, we need to set max_prime to the maximum possible prime in any a_i. But since the original code uses a_i as integers, perhaps in the problem, a_i can be up to 1e6, which is handled by max_prime=1e6.\n\nBut if the problem allows a_i up to 1e9, then this code will not work. However, given that the original code uses Java's BigInteger, which can handle any size, but the Fortran code may have limitations. But in the absence of specific problem constraints, we proceed with the code.\n\nThus, the code should work correctly for the given problem."
