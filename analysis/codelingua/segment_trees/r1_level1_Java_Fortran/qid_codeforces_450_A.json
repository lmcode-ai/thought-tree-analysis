    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does. So the main idea is that there are two queues, q1 and q2. q1 holds the initial values (probably the number of candies each child wants?), and q2 holds their indices. Then, in each iteration, if the front of q1 is less than or equal to m, they remove both elements and note the index as the answer. Otherwise, they subtract m from the front value, move it to the end of the queue, and also move the corresponding index to the end of q2. The last child that gets removed is the answer.\n\nNow, Fortran doesn't have built-in queue structures like Java's LinkedList. So I need to simulate the queues using arrays. Let me think about how to do that.\n\nIn Java, the queues are FIFO. So perhaps in Fortran, I can represent each queue using an array, along with front and rear pointers. But maybe even simpler: use an array and track the current size, and manage the elements by shifting or using a circular buffer. However, for simplicity, maybe using dynamic arrays where we can add elements to the end and remove from the front. But Fortran's arrays are static, unless using allocatable arrays which can be dynamically resized. Alternatively, use a fixed-size array large enough to handle the maximum possible elements (since n is up to, well, the problem constraints probably allow for up to 100 or something, but in code submission, it's better to handle dynamically).\n\nWait, in the original Java code, after each iteration where the value is greater than m, the value is decreased by m and added back to the end of the queue. So the queues can grow and shrink as elements are processed. So in Fortran, perhaps using a list-like structure. But Fortran doesn't have linked lists natively, so maybe use two arrays to represent the queues, and track their current elements.\n\nAlternatively, since each time an element is processed, either it's removed (if <=m) or modified and added to the end. So perhaps the queues can be simulated using two arrays, and using indices to track the current elements.\n\nAnother approach: use two arrays (q1 and q2) and track their size. Each time, check the first element. If it's <=m, remove it (by shifting the array elements left, decrementing the size). Otherwise, subtract m, move the first element (after subtraction) to the end, and do the same for q2. Repeat until the size is zero.\n\nSo for example, in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read n elements into q1 (initial size n) and q2 as the indices 1 to n.\n3. Initialize the current size as n.\n4. While the size is greater than zero:\n   a. Check the first element of q1 (q1(1)).\n   b. If it's <=m: record the corresponding q2(1) as ans. Then remove the first elements from both queues (by shifting the elements left, size decreases by 1).\n   c. Else: subtract m from q1(1), then append this value to the end of q1. Similarly, append q2(1) to the end of q2. Then remove the first elements (shift left, size decreases by 1 but then adds one, so overall size remains the same).\n5. The last recorded ans is the output.\n\nBut implementing this in Fortran requires handling the shifting of elements. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nFor example, when we have an array of size 'size', and we need to remove the first element:\n\nWe can shift elements 2 to size to positions 1 to size-1, then decrement size by 1.\n\nWhen adding an element to the end, increment size by 1 and place the element at position size.\n\nSo in code:\n\nInitialize q1 and q2 as allocatable arrays of integers, starting with size n. Then, process as per above.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So for the queues, the first element is at position 1.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nAllocate q1 and q2 with n elements.\n\nRead the next n integers into q1.\n\nSet q2 as 1, 2, ..., n.\n\nsize = n\n\nans = 0\n\ndo while (size > 0)\n   if (q1(1) <= m) then\n      ans = q2(1)\n      ! remove first element\n      q1 = [q1(2:size)]\n      q2 = [q2(2:size)]\n      size = size - 1\n   else\n      x = q1(1)\n      val = x - m\n      ! remove first element and append val to q1\n      q1 = [q1(2:size), val]\n      ! same for q2: append q2(1) to the end\n      q2 = [q2(2:size), q2(1)]\n      ! size remains the same (since we removed 1, added 1)\n   end if\nend do\n\nprint *, ans\n\nWait, but in Fortran, array operations like [array elements] can be used, but for efficiency, dynamically resizing arrays each time might be possible here. However, in practice, for each iteration, when you remove the first element, you can create a new array with elements from 2 to size, which is O(n) time. But since the problem's constraints are likely acceptable (since the original code is O(n*m) perhaps?), but for large n, this may be slow. However, given that the original code uses a queue and each element is processed once per m steps, but in practice, in programming competition problems, this approach may be acceptable.\n\nBut in the Java code, queues are implemented as linked lists, so adding/removing elements is O(1) time (assuming that the linked list is a doubly linked list). However, in the Fortran approach using array slices, each time we remove the first element, we have to copy the rest of the array, which is O(n) time. For n up to 1e5, this would be too slow, but since the original code is written for codeforces 450 A, which is a problem for Division 2, probably n is small. So the approach would work.\n\nSo the Fortran code would look like this:\n\nBut how to handle dynamic arrays in Fortran? Using allocatable arrays and array constructors.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, m, i, ans, size\n  integer, allocatable :: q1(:), q2(:)\n\n  read *, n, m\n  allocate(q1(n), q2(n))\n  do i = 1, n\n    read *, q1(i)\n    q2(i) = i\n  end do\n  size = n\n  ans = 0\n\n  do while (size > 0)\n    if (q1(1) <= m) then\n      ans = q2(1)\n      if (size == 1) then\n        deallocate(q1, q2)\n        allocate(q1(0), q2(0)) ! empty arrays\n      else\n        q1 = q1(2:size)\n        q2 = q2(2:size)\n      end if\n      size = size - 1\n    else\n      q1(1) = q1(1) - m\n      q1 = [q1(2:size), q1(1)]\n      q2 = [q2(2:size), q2(1)]\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  print *, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but when we do q1 = [q1(2:size), q1(1)], the new array is size elements (since we take 2 to size (size-1 elements) and add 1 element, so total size remains size). Similarly for q2.\n\nBut in the case where we process the element >m, the size remains the same, as we remove the first element and add it to the end. So size doesn't change. So in the code, when processing >m, we don't change the size variable.\n\nWait, but in the code above, when the element is >m, the code does:\n\nq1(1) = q1(1) -m\n\nthen q1 becomes [elements 2 to size] followed by the modified first element.\n\nBut in the original code, the element is subtracted by m and then added to the end. So yes.\n\nBut in the code above, the size variable is not adjusted in the else clause. Wait, but in the code:\n\nIn the else clause, after processing, the queues are modified as follows: the first element is removed (after subtraction) and added to the end. So the total number of elements remains the same. So size should not change. However, in the code above, the size variable is not modified. But in the code, the while loop checks size >0. But when processing the else clause, the size remains the same. Wait, no. Because in the else clause, after modifying the queues, the size is the same as before. So the size variable is not updated here. But in the code as written, when in the else clause, the code does:\n\nq1 = [q1(2:size), q1(1)]\nq2 = [q2(2:size), q2(1)]\n\nSo the new q1 has size elements (since size-1 elements from 2:size, plus 1 element). So the new q1 has size elements. But the variable 'size' is not updated here. Wait, but the variable 'size' is only modified in the if block, not the else. So in the else block, after processing, the queues have the same number of elements as before. But the 'size' variable is not updated. So the code would loop infinitely.\n\nAh, that's a problem. Because in the code, when we process the else clause, the queues have the same number of elements (since we remove one and add one), but the 'size' variable is not adjusted, leading the loop to think the size is the same as before.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 'size' variable is used to track the current size of the queues. However, in the code, the actual size is determined by the allocated size of q1 and q2. But in the code above, after processing the else clause, the queues are reassigned to arrays of size 'size', since q1(2:size) is size-1 elements, and adding q1(1) makes size elements. So the actual length of q1 is now size elements. But the 'size' variable is not adjusted here. But the code's loop is controlled by the 'size' variable, which was initialized to n, and only modified in the if clause. So in the else clause, the code doesn't change 'size', so the loop will not terminate.\n\nThis is a critical error. So how to fix that?\n\nWait, perhaps the 'size' variable should not track the actual size, but instead, the code should check the actual size of the q1 array each time. But in Fortran, the size of an allocatable array can be obtained with the 'size' function. However, the code would have to be adjusted.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not track 'size' as a variable, but instead, each time check the size of the q1 array. Because in the code, when you do q1 = [ ... ], the array is reallocated. So in the else clause, the code:\n\nq1 = [ q1(2:size), q1(1) ]\n\nThis creates a new array of size (size-1 + 1) = size elements. So the actual size of q1 is still 'size', so the 'size' variable remains. So the loop would check size > 0, but 'size' is not modified, leading to an infinite loop.\n\nSo that's a problem. Because in the else clause, after processing, the size of the queue remains the same. But the code's loop is controlled by the 'size' variable, which is only decremented in the if clause.\n\nSo the approach of tracking 'size' as a variable is incorrect here. The code will loop forever in the else case.\n\nTherefore, this approach is flawed. How to handle this?\n\nAlternative approach: instead of tracking 'size' as a variable, use the actual size of the q1 array.\n\nSo modify the code as follows:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, m, ans\n  integer, allocatable :: q1(:), q2(:)\n\n  read *, n, m\n  allocate(q1(n), q2(n))\n  do i = 1, n\n    read *, q1(i)\n    q2(i) = i\n  end do\n\n  ans = 0\n\n  do while (size(q1) > 0)\n    if (q1(1) <= m) then\n      ans = q2(1)\n      if (size(q1) == 1) then\n        deallocate(q1, q2)\n      else\n        q1 = q1(2:)\n        q2 = q2(2:)\n      end if\n    else\n      q1(1) = q1(1) - m\n      q1 = [q1(2:), q1(1)]\n      q2 = [q2(2:), q2(1)]\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  print *, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, in this code, each time we check the size of q1. When the element is <=m, we remove the first element by taking q1(2:), which is all elements from index 2 onwards. If the array had 1 element, this would create an empty array (size 0). Similarly for the else case, we take all elements except the first, and append the modified first element. So the size remains the same in the else case.\n\nThis way, the loop continues until q1 is empty. Let's test this.\n\nExample input:\n\nLet's take sample input from codeforces 450A. For example:\n\nInput:\n\n5 2\n1 3 1 4 2\n\nThe Java code processes this as follows:\n\nThe queues start as q1: [1,3,1,4,2], q2: [1,2,3,4,5].\n\nFirst element is 1 <= 2: remove, ans=1.\n\nNow q1: [3,1,4,2], q2: [2,3,4,5].\n\nNext, 3>2: subtract 2 \u21921, move to end. q1 becomes [1,4,2,1], q2: [3,4,5,2].\n\nNext element is 1 <=2: remove, ans=3.\n\nq1: [4,2,1], q2: [4,5,2].\n\n4>2: subtract 2 \u21922. move to end. q1: [2,1,2], q2: [5,2,4].\n\nNext element 2 <=2: remove, ans=5.\n\nq1: [1,2], q2: [2,4].\n\n1<=2: remove, ans=2.\n\nq1: [2], q2: [4].\n\n2<=2: remove, ans=4.\n\nSo the output is 4.\n\nNow, let's see if the Fortran code would handle this.\n\nIn the Fortran code:\n\nAfter processing each element:\n\nInitially q1 is [1,3,1,4,2], q2 [1,2,3,4,5].\n\nLoop runs while size(q1) >0.\n\nFirst iteration: q1(1)=1<=2. ans=1. q1 becomes [3,1,4,2], q2 [2,3,4,5].\n\nSecond iteration: q1(1)=3>2. subtract 2 to 1. q1 becomes [1,4,2,1], q2 becomes [3,4,5,2].\n\nThird iteration: q1(1)=1<=2. ans=3. q1 becomes [4,2,1], q2 [4,5,2].\n\nFourth iteration: q1(1)=4>2. subtract 2 \u21922. q1 becomes [2,1,2], q2 [5,2,4].\n\nFifth iteration: q1(1)=2<=2. ans=5. q1 becomes [1,2], q2 [2,4].\n\nSixth iteration: q1(1)=1<=2. ans=2. q1 becomes [2], q2 [4].\n\nSeventh iteration: q1(1)=2<=2. ans=4. q1 becomes empty.\n\nLoop exits. Print 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would work. However, in the code as written, when the array is being reassigned, for example, in the else clause:\n\nq1 = [q1(2:), q1(1)]\n\nBut in Fortran, array indexing is from 1 upwards. So q1(2:) refers to elements starting at index 2 to the end. So if q1 is of size 5, then q1(2:) is elements 2,3,4,5. Then appending q1(1) would make a new array of size 5 elements (4 +1). But wait, in the example when q1 is [3,1,4,2], which is size 4:\n\nIn the else clause:\n\nq1(1) is 3>2. subtract m=2 \u21921. Then q1 becomes [1,4,2,1]. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nBut how about when the array is empty? For example, after processing all elements, the code would exit.\n\nBut in the code:\n\nWhen the array q1 becomes empty, size(q1) returns 0, so the loop exits.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, m, i, ans\n  integer, allocatable :: q1(:), q2(:)\n\n  read(*,*) n, m\n  allocate(q1(n), q2(n))\n  do i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) q1(i)\n    q2(i) = i\n  end do\n  ans = 0\n\n  do while (size(q1) > 0)\n    if (q1(1) <= m) then\n      ans = q2(1)\n      if (size(q1) > 1) then\n        q1 = q1(2:)\n        q2 = q2(2:)\n      else\n        deallocate(q1, q2)\n        allocate(q1(0), q2(0)) ! empty arrays\n      end if\n    else\n      q1(1) = q1(1) - m\n      q1 = [q1(2:), q1(1)]\n      q2 = [q2(2:), q2(1)]\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  print*, ans\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the case where the array has one element and we process the if clause (element <= m), then after deallocating and allocating empty arrays, the next iteration of the loop will exit. But in the code as written, the line 'if (size(q1) >1)' checks whether to assign q1(2:), which would fail if size is 1. So when size(q1) is 1, after processing, we deallocate and set to empty arrays. So in the code, the 'else' part of the if (size>1) is to deallocate and allocate empty arrays.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to handle the case where after removing the first element, the array is empty. For example:\n\nIf the current size is 1, then after removing the first element, the array becomes empty. So when the if clause is taken and the array has size 1, then q1(2:) would be from index 2 to the end of the array. But since the array has size 1, q1(2:) is out of bounds. But in Fortran, this would result in an array section of length 0, so when you assign q1 = q1(2:), the new array is of size 0.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you have an array of size 1, and take elements from 2: (which is beyond the upper bound), the array section is an empty array. So assigning q1(2:) in that case would result in an array of size 0.\n\nSo the code can be simplified. For the if clause, regardless of the current size, we can assign q1 = q1(2:). If the size is 1, then q1(2:) is an empty array, so q1 becomes empty.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, m, i, ans\n  integer, allocatable :: q1(:), q2(:)\n\n  read(*,*) n, m\n  allocate(q1(n), q2(n))\n  do i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) q1(i)\n    q2(i) = i\n  end do\n  ans = 0\n\n  do while (size(q1) > 0)\n    if (q1(1) <= m) then\n      ans = q2(1)\n      q1 = q1(2:)\n      q2 = q2(2:)\n    else\n      q1(1) = q1(1) - m\n      q1 = [q1(2:), q1(1)]\n      q2 = [q2(2:), q2(1)]\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  print*, ans\nend program main\n\nThis should work.\n\nLet me test when size is 1. Suppose q1 has [5], m is 2. First iteration: 5>2. subtract 2 \u21923. Then q1 becomes [3]. So the array is reassigned to [q1(2:), q1(1)]. But q1(2:) is empty, so [empty array followed by 3] \u2192 [3]. So the array size remains 1. Next iteration: 3>2 \u21921. Then array becomes [1]. Next iteration: 1<=2. ans=1. q1 becomes q1(2:), which is empty. Loop exits. Output is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when the first element is already <=m, and size is 1. Then ans is set to q2(1), and q1 becomes empty.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother possible problem is when the queue is empty. But the loop condition checks size(q1) >0.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
