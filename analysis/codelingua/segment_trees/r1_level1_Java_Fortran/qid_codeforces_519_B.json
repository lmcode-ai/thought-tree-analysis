Then it finds x as a - b and y as b - c, and prints x and y.\n\nSo, the key steps are: read n, then read three sets of numbers, sum each set, compute differences, and output.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, reading input can be done with the READ statement. But handling multiple lines might be a bit tricky. In Java, the scanner reads integers one by one, so each nextInt() gets the next integer from the input, regardless of line breaks. In Fortran, when reading from the console, each READ statement typically reads a line. But here, the input could be all the numbers on a single line or multiple lines. So we need to read all the numbers in sequence, which might require reading lines and splitting into individual integers.\n\nWait, but the original Java code uses three separate loops. The first loop reads n numbers, then the next loop n-1, then n-2. So for the Java code, after the first n numbers are read (sum into a), the next n-1 are read (sum into b), then the next n-2 (sum into c). So the order of input is:\n\nn\nthen the first list (n numbers)\nthen the second list (n-1 numbers)\nthen the third list (n-2 numbers)\n\nWait, no. Looking at the Java code:\n\nThe code reads n as the first input. Then, in three separate loops, each loop reads the required number of integers. The first loop runs n times, adding each integer to a. The second runs n-1 times, adding to b. The third runs n-2 times, adding to c.\n\nSo the input structure is:\n\nn\n[list1: n integers]\n[list2: n-1 integers]\n[list3: n-2 integers]\n\nBut how are these lists provided? They could be all in one line, or each list in a line, etc. The Java code doesn't care, as it just reads integers sequentially. So in Fortran, the approach should be to read all the integers in the same order.\n\nSo, for Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n integers for a.\n\nThen read n-1 integers for b.\n\nThen read n-2 integers for c.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading from the console line by line. So if the user enters all numbers in a single line, the first read would get n, then the next reads would get the numbers for a, but maybe the input is spread across multiple lines. So the code should handle any such case, as the original Java code does.\n\nBut how to handle this in Fortran?\n\nIn Fortran, each READ statement typically reads a new line. So if the input is given as:\n\n3\n1 2 3\n4 5\n6\n\nThen the first read gets n=3. Then the first loop reads 1, 2, 3 (sum a=6). Then next loop reads 4,5 (sum b=9). Then next loop reads 6 (sum c=6). But if the input is all in one line, like:\n\n3 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nThen the first read of n=3. Then the first loop would read 1, 2, 3 (from the same line). Then the next loop would read 4,5 (but the remaining line has 4 5 6). So the next two reads (for n-1=2) would take 4 and 5. Then the third loop (n-2=1) would read 6. Which is correct.\n\nBut how to read the numbers sequentially regardless of line breaks? Because in Fortran, each READ statement by default starts from a new line. So perhaps we need to read all the input into an array first, and then process them in order.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire input as a single line and split into integers. But that's not straightforward in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, use a list-directed read. Let's think.\n\nThe Java code reads all the integers in sequence. So the Fortran code should do the same. But if we use multiple READ statements with * as the format, each READ will take a new line. So perhaps that's not going to work. For example, if the input is provided as:\n\n3\n1 2 3 4 5\n6\n\nThen the first read gets n=3. The first loop reads three integers from the next line (1,2,3). Then the second loop reads n-1=2 integers from the next line (4,5). Then the third loop reads n-2=1 integer from the next line (6). But if the input is all in one line, like:\n\n3 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nThen the first read gets n=3. Then the first loop tries to read 3 integers. The remaining data in the first line is 1 2 3 4 5 6. So the first three would be read, leaving 4 5 6. The next loop reads 2 integers (4 and 5), then the third loop reads 1 (6). That works.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the data is split across lines. For example:\n\nn is 3.\n\nList1 is 1 2\n\nThen next line is 3.\n\nList2 is 4 5\n\nList3 is 6.\n\nIn this case, the first loop would read 1 and 2 from the first line, then need to read one more integer. So the next read would take 3 from the next line. Then list2's 4 and 5 would be read from next lines? Or not.\n\nBut in the original Java code, the scanner reads integers regardless of line breaks, as it's reading tokens. So the Fortran code needs to do the same. Therefore, the approach would be to read all the integers into a single array first, then process them in order.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Read all the integers from input into a list (array), then process them in order.\n\nBut how to do this in Fortran?\n\nAlternatively, read the entire input as a single string, split into tokens, convert to integers. But that's a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, you can read using a format that allows multiple lines, but perhaps using a loop that reads each integer, possibly from any line.\n\nBut in Fortran, each READ statement advances to the next line. So for example, if you have:\n\ndo i=1, n\n    read *, x\n    a = a + x\nend do\n\nEach iteration of the loop would read a line, but if the line has multiple values, perhaps it's possible.\n\nWait, no. Using list-directed input (READ *, x), the first read would read the first value from the current line. The next read would read the next value from the same line, until the line is exhausted. Then, the next read would read from the next line.\n\nSo for example, if the input is:\n\n3\n1 2 3\n4 5\n6\n\nThen:\n\nn=3 is read.\n\nThen, the first loop (sum a) would read 1, 2, 3 from the second line. Then the loop for sum b (n-1=2) would read 4 and 5 from the third line. Then the loop for sum c (n-2=1) would read 6 from the fourth line. That works.\n\nAnother example where all numbers are in the same line after n:\n\n3 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nThen, after reading n=3, the first loop would read 1, 2, 3 from the same line. Then the next loop would read 4,5 (from the remaining part of the line). Then the next loop reads 6 (from the same line). This works.\n\nSo the code can be written with three loops, each reading the required number of integers. Each read in the loop uses list-directed input (read *), which will take the next integer from the current line or the next line if needed.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the code would be something like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, a, b, c, x, y, i, temp\n\n    read *, n\n\n    a = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        read *, temp\n        a = a + temp\n    end do\n\n    b = 0\n    do i = 1, n-1\n        read *, temp\n        b = b + temp\n    end do\n\n    c = 0\n    do i = 1, n-2\n        read *, temp\n        c = c + temp\n    end do\n\n    x = a - b\n    y = b - c\n\n    print *, x\n    print *, y\n\nend program main\n\nYes, this should work. Because each read in the loop reads the next integer in the input, regardless of line breaks, similar to Java's Scanner.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input. Let's take the sample input from codeforces. For example, if the input is:\n\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 3 4 5\n3 4 5\n\nThen n=5. Sum a is 1+2+3+4+5=15. Sum b is 2+3+4+5=14. Sum c is 3+4+5=12. So x=15-14=1, y=14-12=2. The output would be 1 and 2.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the first loop reads 5 numbers (1-5), then the next loop reads 4 (n-1=4) numbers (2-5), then next loop 3 (n-2=3) numbers (3-5). So sums are correct. Then x and y are printed. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: input as all in one line:\n\n3 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nn=3.\n\nsum a is 1+2+3=6.\n\nsum b is 4+5=9.\n\nsum c is 6.\n\nx=6-9=-3, y=9-6=3. Output would be -3 and 3.\n\nIn Fortran code, the first loop reads 3 numbers (1,2,3) from the first line (since after reading n=3, the rest is 1 2 3 4 5 6). Then the next loop reads 2 numbers (4,5). Then next loop reads 1 number (6). So yes.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, some Fortran specifics. All variables are declared. The program starts with 'program main', ends with 'end program main'. Implicit none is important. The variables n, a, b, c, x, y, i, temp are integers. The loops correctly count from 1 to n, etc. Each read in the loop reads a temp, adds to the sum. Then compute x and y, print each on separate lines.\n\nFortran's print statement adds a newline by default when using list-directed output (print *). So each print *, x will output the number followed by a new line. Which matches the Java code's System.out.println.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
