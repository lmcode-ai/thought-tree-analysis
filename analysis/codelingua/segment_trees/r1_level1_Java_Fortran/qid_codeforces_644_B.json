Wait no, because when elements are added to the end, but the queue elements are processed in order. Wait, the code in Java's loop is while the first element is <=t, remove it. That's not correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads two integers, n and b. Then it processes n tasks. For each task, it reads t and d. The queue here is a LinkedList that keeps track of the end times of the tasks. For each task, it first removes all elements from the front of the queue that are <= current t, which means those tasks have finished. Then, if the queue size is less than or equal to b, it calculates the end time of the current task as max(t, last element in queue) + d, and adds it to the queue. If the queue is full (size > b), then the answer is -1. Finally, it prints all the answers.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the data structures. In Java, a LinkedList is used as a queue. In Fortran, we can simulate a queue using an array and keeping track of the front and rear indices. But since the maximum size of the queue is b+1 (since if size <= b, we can add), we can manage with a fixed-size array. \n\nFirst, declare variables. n and b are integers. The answer array in Java is a long array, which in Fortran would be an array of integers (but since Fortran's integer can be 8 bytes, maybe use integer(kind=8)). Or maybe use integer, since the problem might not require very large numbers. Wait, the Java code uses long for the ans array because the end times can be large. So in Fortran, we should use integer(kind=8) for ans and the queue elements.\n\nThe queue operations: in Java, pollFirst() removes the first element. But the code checks if the queue is not empty and the first element is <= t. So in the loop, we remove elements from the front as long as they are <= t. So in Fortran, we need to manage the queue such that the front can be advanced. Alternatively, since the elements are processed in order, maybe the queue is maintained as a list of elements in order, and we can keep track of the start and end indices.\n\nWait, perhaps using a dynamic array in Fortran would be better. But Fortran doesn't have linked lists. So maybe use an array to represent the queue, and manage the front and rear. Hmm. Alternatively, for each iteration, we can check the elements in the queue and remove the ones <=t from the front. But since the queue is a FIFO, the elements are in order. So once we find the first element that is >t, all subsequent elements are after that. Wait no, because when elements are added to the end, but the queue elements are processed in order. Wait, the code in Java's loop is while the first element is <=t, remove it. That's not correct. Wait, no: the code is while the queue is not empty and the first element is <= t, remove the first element. Wait, that would remove all elements in the queue that are <=t. But since the queue is ordered, and each new element added is after the previous ones, the elements are in increasing order. So if the first element is <=t, then all elements after could be <=t as well? No, because each task's end time is the previous end time (or t) plus d, which is positive. So the queue elements are in strictly increasing order. Therefore, once the first element is >t, the rest are also >t. So the loop can be simplified to checking the first element, and removing it if it's <=t. Then, after that, since the queue is empty or the first element is >t, we can exit the loop. Wait, no. Let me see: suppose the queue has elements [5,7,9], and t is 6. The first element is 5 <=6, so we remove it. Now the queue is [7,9], which is >6, so the loop stops. But if the queue had elements [5,6,7], and t is 6, then after removing 5, the next first element is 6, which is <=6, so it's removed. Then queue is [7], which is >6, loop stops. So the loop in Java removes all elements from the front that are <=t. So in Fortran, we need to loop while the queue is not empty and the first element is <=t, removing the first element each time. But how to represent the queue here.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps using an array where we track the front and rear. Let's see. Let's say we have a queue array, and variables front and rear. The front starts at 1, and rear at 0. Each time we add an element, rear increments. To remove from front, front increments. But when front > rear, the queue is empty. However, for the problem, after processing each task, the queue's elements are the end times of the currently queued tasks. So, for each task, we first check the front of the queue (queue(front)) and if it's <=t, remove it (front increments). But we need to loop until the front element is >t or the queue is empty.\n\nWait, but in Java, the code uses a LinkedList and removes the first elements until they are <=t. So in Fortran, perhaps we can model the queue with an array, and track the current front and rear indices. But each time, when checking, we start from the front and check elements in order until we find one that's >t, then stop, and set front to that index. Wait, but in Java, each loop iteration removes the first element. So in Fortran, maybe in each iteration, we check the first element (front), if it's <=t, remove it (front +=1), and continue. So for example, in Fortran, the code would be:\n\ndo while (front <= rear)\n    if (queue(front) <= t) then\n        front = front +1\n    else\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut wait, no. Because in Java, the loop is while the first element is <=t. So in Fortran, the loop would be: while the queue is not empty and the first element (queue(front)) <=t, remove the first element (front +=1). So we can do:\n\ndo while (front <= rear)\n    if (queue(front) <= t) then\n        front = front +1\n    else\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but once the front element is >t, we exit the loop. But suppose the queue has elements [5,6,7], and t=6. The first element is 5 <=6, remove (front becomes 2). Now the front is 6 <=6, remove (front becomes 3). Now the front is 7 >6, exit. So yes, this loop works.\n\nSo in Fortran, the queue can be represented with an array, say, q, with a maximum size of b+1 (since when size is <=b, we can add). But in the code, the queue can have up to b+1 elements? Wait, no: the condition is if (q.size() <= b), then add. Wait, in Java code, the condition is if (q.size() <= b), then proceed. So the queue can have a size of up to b+1? Let's see. Suppose the current queue has size b. Then adding a new element would make size b+1, which is allowed? Wait, the Java code checks if the queue's size is <=b. So if the size is <=b, then process, else return -1. So when the queue's size is <=b, then the task can be added. So the maximum size of the queue is b. Because if the current size is b, adding a new element would make it b+1, which is >b. Wait, no. Let's look at the code:\n\nif (q.size() <= b) {\n    ans[i] = ...;\n    q.add(ans[i]);\n} else {\n    ans[i] = -1;\n}\n\nSo when the queue's current size is <=b, the new element is added, which increases the size by 1. So the maximum possible size is b+1. Wait, but that can't be. For example, if the queue is allowed up to b elements, then when the size is b, adding a new element would make it b+1, which is over. So perhaps the code has a mistake here. But the original Java code uses LinkedList, and in the problem statement, the buffer size is B. The buffer can hold up to B processes. So when adding a new process, if the queue (buffer) size is <= B, then add. Wait, perhaps the code is correct. Because when the buffer size is B, adding a new one would make it B+1. So perhaps the buffer can hold up to B+1 processes, but according to the problem statement, that's allowed? Maybe the problem's description is that the buffer can hold B processes. So the code's condition is wrong? Hmm. But the code is given, and we need to translate it as is.\n\nBut the Java code's condition is \"if (q.size() <= b)\", which allows adding when the size is equal to b. So the queue can have size up to b+1. For example, initial size is b: add makes it b+1. Then next task, the size is b+1, which is larger than b, so -1. So the code's logic is that the buffer can hold up to b+1 elements. That might be a bug in the original code, but since we're translating, we need to replicate that.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the queue must allow up to b+1 elements. So the array for the queue must have a maximum size of, say, b+1. But since the queue elements are processed in order, perhaps the queue can be represented as an array with front and rear indices. However, in Fortran, the array is fixed size, but we can dynamically manage the front and rear.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Read n and b.\n\n2. Initialize the ans array as integer(8) with size n.\n\n3. Initialize the queue. Let's use an array q of size (b+2) maybe, and front and rear pointers. Initially, front=1, rear=0.\n\n4. For each i from 1 to n:\n\n   a. Read t and d.\n\n   b. While front <= rear and q(front) <= t: increment front (remove elements from front).\n\n   c. Check if (rear - front +1) <= b. Because rear - front +1 is the current size of the queue.\n\n   d. If yes:\n\n       i. The end time is either t or q(rear) (if queue not empty) plus d.\n\n       ii. Add this end time to the queue (rear +=1, q(rear) = end_time).\n\n       iii. ans(i) = end_time.\n\n   e. Else:\n\n       i. ans(i) = -1.\n\n5. After processing all, print the ans array.\n\nBut wait, in Java's code, the condition is q.size() <=b. The queue size is the number of elements in it. So in the Fortran code, the size is rear - front +1 +1? Wait, no. Let's see: front and rear are indices. If front is 1 and rear is 5, then the queue has 5 elements. So the size is rear - front +1. So when the code checks if the queue size is <=b, in Fortran it's (rear - front +1) <=b.\n\nWait, suppose front is 1, rear is 3. The queue has 3 elements (1,2,3). rear - front +1 =3. So yes. So the condition is (rear - front +1) <=b.\n\nBut when adding a new element, rear becomes rear+1, so the new size is (rear+1 - front +1) = (rear - front +2). So after adding, the new size is (current size) +1.\n\nWait, initial size is s = rear - front +1.\n\nAfter adding, rear becomes rear+1. New size is (rear+1 - front +1) = (rear - front +2) = s+1.\n\nSo when the current size is s, adding the new element makes it s+1. So the condition for allowing the addition is s <=b. Thus, the new size after adding is s+1, which may be up to b+1.\n\nSo in the code, the condition is if (s <=b) then add, else -1.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each task:\n\nCheck if (rear - front +1) <=b.\n\nIf yes, proceed to add.\n\nNow, the end time is computed as the maximum of t and the last element in the queue (q(rear)), plus d.\n\nWait, in Java code: ans[i] = (q.isEmpty() ? t : q.getLast()) + d;\n\nSo if the queue is empty, use t. Otherwise, use the last element (q.getLast()), which is q(rear) in Fortran. Then add d.\n\nSo the end time is (if queue is empty, then t else last element) + d.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the loop to remove elements from the front, check if (rear >= front). If not, then the queue is empty. So:\n\nif (rear < front) then\n    current_end = t + d\nelse\n    current_end = q(rear) + d\nend if\n\nThen, add this current_end to the queue.\n\nBut then, when adding to the queue, what if the queue's array is full? Wait, the array's size can be set to b+1 elements. Since the maximum possible queue size is b+1 (when s was b before adding). So, the array needs to have enough space. So in Fortran, the queue array can be dimensioned to (b_max +1). But what if b is up to, say, 1e5? Then the array can be dynamically allocated.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be handled with allocatable. So perhaps the code can allocate the queue array with size (b+1), since the maximum possible elements in the queue after adding is b+1. Wait, but when you have a queue that can have up to b+1 elements, the array needs to have at least (b+1) elements. So, in Fortran, when the user inputs b, perhaps the queue array can be allocated as (b+2) to be safe.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code can't allocate the array after reading b, because the code structure may require explicit allocation. Wait, the code reads n and b first. Then, allocate the queue array.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n and b.\n\nAllocate ans(n) as integer(8).\n\nAllocate q(b + 2) as integer(8). Or maybe b+1 is sufficient. Because the maximum size is b+1.\n\nThen, front = 1, rear = 0.\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger(8) :: n, b\ninteger(8), allocatable :: ans(:)\ninteger(8), allocatable :: q(:)\ninteger(8) :: front, rear\n\nread(*,*) n, b\n\nallocate(ans(n))\nallocate(q(b + 2)) ! to be safe\n\nfront = 1\nrear = 0\n\nThen, loop over each task:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) t, d\n\n    ! Remove elements from front <= t\n    do while (front <= rear)\n        if (q(front) <= t) then\n            front = front + 1\n        else\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    current_size = rear - front + 1\n\n    if (current_size <= b) then\n        if (front > rear) then ! queue is empty\n            current_end = t + d\n        else\n            current_end = q(rear) + d\n        end if\n\n        rear = rear + 1\n        q(rear) = current_end\n        ans(i) = current_end\n    else\n        ans(i) = -1\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, print the ans array:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') ans(i), ' '\nend do\nprint *, ''\n\nBut in Fortran, using advance='no' may not work for all compilers. Alternatively, collect the output into a string and print it. Alternatively, print each element followed by a space, but the last element may have a trailing space. The original Java code outputs a space after each element, including the last one. So the Fortran code can do the same.\n\nSo:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    write(*, '(I0, \" \")', advance='no') ans(i)\nend do\nwrite(*, *) ''  ! To move to a new line after.\n\nBut some compilers may require using non-advancing I/O, but this could be tricky. Alternatively, build a format string that prints all elements separated by spaces.\n\nBut for simplicity, loop through each element and print with a space, then after the loop, print a new line.\n\nAlternatively, use an implied loop:\n\nwrite(*, '(*(I0, \" \"))') ans\n\nBut that would print all elements followed by a space, including a trailing space. Which is the same as the Java code.\n\nSo using:\n\nprint '(*(I0, \" \"))', ans\n\nBut the print statement adds a new line at the end. So that's okay.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nNow, considering data types. The variables t and d in Java are int, but in Fortran, since we are adding them to the queue which is long in Java, we should use integer(8) for all variables to handle large numbers.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nprogram codeforces_644_B\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: n, b, i, t, d, current_end, current_size\n    integer(8), allocatable :: ans(:)\n    integer(8), allocatable :: q(:)\n    integer(8) :: front, rear\n\n    read(*,*) n, b\n    allocate(ans(n))\n    allocate(q(b + 2))  ! Allocate enough space for the queue\n\n    front = 1\n    rear = 0\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) t, d\n\n        ! Remove elements from the front that are <= t\n        do while (front <= rear)\n            if (q(front) <= t) then\n                front = front + 1\n            else\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        current_size = rear - front + 1\n\n        if (current_size <= b) then\n            if (front > rear) then\n                current_end = t + d\n            else\n                current_end = q(rear) + d\n            end if\n\n            rear = rear + 1\n            q(rear) = current_end\n            ans(i) = current_end\n        else\n            ans(i) = -1_8\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print '(*(I0, \" \"))', ans\n\n    deallocate(ans)\n    deallocate(q)\nend program codeforces_644_B\n\nBut wait, the queue array is allocated with size (b+2), but what if b is zero? Then the code may have issues. Hmm. Because if b is zero, the condition is (current_size <=0). The queue can have size 0. Then adding a new element would make it size 1, which is allowed. But if the buffer size is zero, the maximum allowed queue size is zero. Wait, in Java code, when b is zero, the queue can have size up to 0. So the condition is if (q.size() <=0) which is only possible when the queue is empty. So adding a new element when queue is empty would make it size 1, which is >0, so the else case would trigger. So the code would not allow any tasks to be queued when b is zero. But according to the original code's logic, when b is zero, the queue can only be empty. So any task would have to be processed immediately, but if another task is in progress, it can't be queued. Hmm.\n\nBut the Fortran code's queue array is allocated with size (b+2). If b is zero, the size is 2, which is okay. So the code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the queue is full. For example, when the buffer size is b, and the current size is b, then adding a new element would make it b+1, which is allowed. Then the next element would check if the size is <=b, which is no. So in Fortran, the code correctly checks (current_size <=b), allowing adding when current_size is b.\n\nWait, no. current_size is the size before adding. So if current_size is b, then after adding, it becomes b+1, which would exceed the buffer. But according to the Java code, if the current size is <=b, then add. So the code allows the queue to reach size b+1.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the buffer size is B. So perhaps the Java code's condition is incorrect, but we have to follow it. So the Fortran code's condition is correct as per the Java code.\n\nAnother point: when allocating the queue array, in Fortran, the code uses allocate(q(b+2)), but perhaps it should be allocate(q(1:b+2))? Or maybe the code as written is correct. Wait, in Fortran, when you allocate an array with allocate(q(b+2)), it creates an array of size b+2, with indices starting from 1 (assuming default). Wait, no: in Fortran, the default lower bound is 1. So allocate(q(b+2)) creates an array of size (1:b+2). So the maximum possible elements in the queue is up to b+1, which is sufficient.\n\nFor example, if b=3, then q is size 5 (b+2=5, indices 1 to5). Then the queue can have up to 4 elements (when front=1, rear=4, which is 4 elements). But according to the code logic, the maximum possible queue size is b+1. So if b=3, then when current_size is 3 (<=3), adding a new element would make it 4 (rear=4). Which is allowed. So the queue array's size (b+2) is correct, allowing rear up to b+2. Wait, no. If b=3, then b+2=5. The queue can have up to rear=5. The maximum current_size would be 5 - front +1. If front is 1, rear=5, current_size is5. But according to the code's logic, the queue's maximum size is b+1. Wait, no. For example, when b=3, the condition is current_size <=3. So adding when current_size is3 (allowed), making it 4. So the queue's size can be up to 4 (b+1). But the array size is 5 (indices 1-5). So rear can go up to5, but the code's logic allows up to current_size=4. Which would require rear - front +1 =4. So front=1, rear=4. Which is allowed. So the array size of5 is sufficient. So the code's allocation is correct.\n\nAnother point: the variables in Fortran should be declared as integer(8). Because in Java, long is 64-bit. So in Fortran, using 8-byte integers is necessary to prevent overflow.\n\nTesting the code with some sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 1\n0 1\n1 2\n1 3\n4 1\n4 1\n\nJava code output:\n\n1 3 6 5 6 \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nProcessing each task:\n\ni=0: t=0, d=1.\n\nqueue is empty. So ans[0] =0+1=1. add to queue. queue becomes [1].\n\ni=1: t=1, d=2.\n\nCheck queue: first element is1 <=1. Remove it. queue is empty.\n\ncurrent_size=0 <=1. So ans[1] =1+2=3. add to queue. queue [3].\n\ni=2: t=1, d=3.\n\nCheck queue: first element is3>1. So loop stops. current_size=1 <=1. So ans[2] =3 +3=6. add to queue. queue [3,6]. size is 2, which is >1. Wait, no. current_size was 1 before adding. So adding increases to 2, but the code allowed it because current_size (before adding) was 1 <=1. So this task's ans is6, and queue becomes size 2. So for the next task, current_size would be2>1, so ans=-1.\n\ni=3: t=4, d=1.\n\nCheck queue: front is1, rear=2. q(1)=3 <=4. Remove front (3). front becomes2. q(2)=6>4. loop stops. current_size=2-2+1=1 <=1. So ans[3] =6 +1=7. Wait, but in Java code, this task's t is4. Then after removing elements, the queue is [6]. So current_end is6+1=7. ans[3] is7. queue becomes [6,7]. size 2.\n\nBut wait, the buffer size is1. So when adding, current_size is1 (after removing 3). So adding is allowed. Then the size becomes2. Which is allowed? According to Java code, yes. Because the condition is if (q.size() <=b) { add to queue }, and in this case, the q.size() is1 (after removing 3). So adding makes it2. Which is allowed when b is1. But according to the problem statement, the buffer is supposed to hold B processes. So this suggests a bug in the original Java code. But we have to replicate it.\n\nBut regardless, the code is to be translated as is.\n\nSo the Fortran code handles this correctly.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nBut perhaps the code's logic is correct, and the buffer is allowed to have B+1 elements. Maybe the problem's B is the number of elements allowed in the buffer, not the capacity. Or perhaps the original problem has a different logic.\n\nBut regardless, the code is to be translated as per the Java code.\n\nSo the Fortran code as written should correctly replicate the Java code's logic.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nIf b is 0.\n\nFor example, n=2, b=0.\n\nTask 1: t=0, d=1. Queue is empty. current_size is 0 <=0. So add. ans[0] =0+1=1. queue size becomes1.\n\nTask 2: t=0, d=1. Remove elements <=0. If queue's first element is1>0. current_size=1. Which is >0. So ans[1] =-1.\n\nSo output is1 -1.\n\nIn Java code, same result.\n\nSo the Fortran code handles this.\n\nAnother case: when the queue is full. For example, b=1, and after adding, queue size becomes2. Then next task's current_size is2>1, so ans=-1.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java code's behavior."
