    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the original code does. \n\nSo, the Java code reads an integer n from input, then reads an array of n long integers. It calculates the sum of the absolute values of the first element and the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Finally, it prints the total sum.\n\nFirst, I need to replicate this logic in Fortran. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nIn Java, they use a Scanner to read input. In Fortran, I'll read from standard input using READ statements. Fortran uses dynamic arrays, but here the size n is known at runtime. So, I can read n first, then allocate an array of that size.\n\nWait, Java uses long for the array elements. In Fortran, the equivalent would probably be integer(kind=8), assuming that the input numbers are integers. But looking at the code, they use Math.abs, which can handle both integers and floating points. Wait, but the Java code's arr is of type long[], which is 64-bit integers. So the problem might involve integer values, but the absolute differences and sum are computed as integers.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, if I use integers, then the absolute value functions would work. However, maybe the original code allows for negative numbers, but the problem expects integer handling. So I should use integer variables in Fortran.\n\nWait, but the Java code uses nextInt() to read the array elements, which are integers. So the array elements are integers. So the Fortran code should read integers as well.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Read integer n from input.\n2. Read n integers into an array.\n3. Compute the sum of absolute values: first element's absolute value, then each subsequent element minus the previous, take absolute value, sum all.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n- Read n: INTEGER :: n; READ(*,*) n\n- Allocate array: INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: arr(:); ALLOCATE(arr(n))\n- Read the array: READ(*,*) arr\n- Compute the sum: Initialize answer as ABS(arr(1)). Then loop from 2 to n, add ABS(arr(i) - arr(i-1)) each time.\n\nWait, in Java, arrays are 0-based. So in Java, the loop starts at i=1 (second element) up to n-1. So in Fortran, which is 1-based by default, the array elements from 1 to n. The loop should run from 2 to n. So for i from 2 to n, compute arr(i) - arr(i-1).\n\nSo the answer is the sum of ABS(arr(1)) plus sum of ABS(arr(i) - arr(i-1)) for i from 2 to n.\n\nNow, let's code this in Fortran.\n\nPossible code structure:\n\nPROGRAM main\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER :: n, i\n    INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: arr(:)\n    INTEGER(KIND=8) :: answer  ! To handle large sums, maybe?\n\n    READ(*,*) n\n    ALLOCATE(arr(n))\n    READ(*,*) arr\n\n    answer = ABS(arr(1))\n    DO i = 2, n\n        answer = answer + ABS(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n    END DO\n\n    PRINT *, answer\n\n    DEALLOCATE(arr)\nEND PROGRAM main\n\nWait, but in Java, the array elements are of type long, which is 64-bit. In Fortran, the default integer might be 32-bit. So if the problem expects large numbers, we need to use 64-bit integers. So in Fortran, declare the array and answer as INTEGER(KIND=8). \n\nBut the input is read using nextInt(), which in Java is 32-bit. Wait, but the original code uses long[] for the array, which suggests that the elements are 64-bit. But the code reads them with nextInt(), which returns an int. Wait, that's a problem. Oh wait, no. Wait, no. The Java code's array is of type long[], which is 64-bit integers. But the code uses scan.nextInt() which returns an int (32-bit). So, when you assign arr[i] = scan.nextInt(), the int is promoted to long. That could cause issues if the input numbers exceed 32-bit integer limits. So perhaps in the original code, the problem expects that the inputs are within 32-bit range, but stored as long. Maybe that's a mistake, but maybe that's intended.\n\nIn any case, for Fortran, perhaps the code should read the array elements as 32-bit integers, but given that Java uses long, maybe Fortran should use 64-bit integers. To replicate exactly, perhaps in Fortran we should use 64-bit integers.\n\nSo, in Fortran, declare the array and answer as INTEGER(KIND=8). Because Java's long is 64-bit.\n\nSo modify the declarations:\n\nINTEGER :: n, i\nINTEGER(KIND=8), ALLOCATABLE :: arr(:)\nINTEGER(KIND=8) :: answer\n\nBut when reading the array, how does Fortran handle the input? If the input numbers are within the 32-bit range, but stored as 64-bit, that's okay. So in the Fortran code, arr is of kind=8.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nPROGRAM main\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER :: n, i\n    INTEGER(KIND=8), ALLOCATABLE :: arr(:)\n    INTEGER(KIND=8) :: answer\n\n    READ(*,*) n\n    ALLOCATE(arr(n))\n    READ(*,*) arr\n\n    answer = ABS(arr(1))\n    DO i = 2, n\n        answer = answer + ABS(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n    END DO\n\n    PRINT *, answer\n\n    DEALLOCATE(arr)\nEND PROGRAM main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the KIND parameter for 64-bit integer can vary. The standard way is to use selected_int_kind. For example, INTEGER(KIND=8) may not be portable. Alternatively, use:\n\nINTEGER, PARAMETER :: INT64 = SELECTED_INT_KIND(18)\nINTEGER(INT64) :: answer\n\nBut perhaps the original code uses 64-bit integers, and in Fortran, using INTEGER(KIND=8) is common, assuming the compiler uses that for 64-bit. So proceed with that.\n\nAnother thing: in Java, the initial answer is the absolute value of the first element. Then, for each subsequent element, add the absolute difference between current and previous.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting the code with sample input. For example, if n=1, the sum is ABS(arr[0]). For n=2, arr[0] and arr[1], sum is ABS(a1) + ABS(a2 - a1).\n\nWait, in Java, the code starts answer with abs(arr[0]). Then for i from 1 to n-1 (since array is 0-based), adds abs(arr[i] - arr[i-1]). So for n=2, it's abs(arr[0]) + abs(arr[1]-arr[0}).\n\nBut in Fortran, the array is 1-based. So the code starts with arr(1), then for i from 2 to n, adds abs(arr(i)-arr(i-1)). Which is the same as the Java code when the Java array is 0-based and the loop runs from 1 to n-1.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nPotential issues: when n=0? But according to the problem statement, perhaps n is at least 1. The Java code reads n and proceeds; if n is zero, arr would be zero-length, and the code would crash. But the problem probably ensures n >=1. So the Fortran code is safe.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when you read the array with READ(*,*) arr, it expects the input to have exactly n numbers on the same line or subsequent lines. The Java code reads each number with nextInt(), so each can be on separate lines or same line. The Fortran code's READ(*,*) arr will read all n numbers, regardless of line breaks, as per Fortran's list-directed input. So that should handle the same inputs.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
