In Java:\n\nfor (i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n   if (i is last element) count++\n\n   else if (A[i] == A[i+1]) { do nothing }\n\n   else if (A[i] < A[i+1]) {\n\n       while (A[i] <= A[i+1]) {\n\n           i++;\n\n           if (i is last) break;\n\n       }\n\n       count++;\n\n   }\n\n   else {\n\n       while (A[i] >= A[i+1]) {\n\n           i++;\n\n           if (i is last) break;\n\n       }\n\n       count++;\n\n   }\n\n} So, for example, when A[i] < A[i+1], it enters the increasing phase. It increments i as long as A[i] <= A[i+1], then counts this as one segment. Similarly for decreasing. So each segment is a maximum length sequence of either non-decreasing or non-increasing.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads an integer N, then reads N integers into an array A. It counts the number of \"segments\" where each segment is either non-decreasing or non-increasing. For example, if the sequence increases, then decreases, that's two segments. The code loops through the array, checks the direction (increasing, decreasing, or equal), and increments the count when a segment ends.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, reading input. In Java, they use Scanner to read from stdin. In Fortran, I'll read from standard input using READ(*,*). So, read N, then read the array A of size N.\n\nThen, the main loop. The Java code uses a for loop with i starting at 0, and within the loop, there are some conditions. The tricky part is that the Java code increments i inside the loop when it's part of an increasing or decreasing sequence, which could skip some indices. Fortran's do loop doesn't allow modifying the loop variable directly, so perhaps a do-while loop with an index variable that's manually incremented would be better.\n\nSo, in Fortran, we can use a variable i initialized to 1 (since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default), and then have a loop that continues until i reaches N. Inside the loop, check the current and next elements.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when i reaches N-1 (since Java is 0-based), it increments count. So in Fortran, when i equals N, increment count.\n\nWait, let's clarify the indices. Java's array is 0-based, Fortran is 1-based. So when Java checks i == N-1, that's the last element, which in Fortran would be i == N. So the code for when i is the last element is to count +=1.\n\nNow, in the Java code:\n\nFor each i from 0 to N-1:\n\nIf i is the last element (i == N-1), then count++.\n\nElse, if A[i] == A[i+1], do nothing. But in the Java code, the next elements are skipped via the inner loops. Wait, no. The Java code's inner loops are when the current segment is increasing or decreasing. Let's see.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nIf i is last element, count++.\n\nElse if A[i] == A[i+1], then do nothing (so the loop proceeds to the next i). Wait no, the Java code has 'else if (A[i] == A[i+1]);' then a semicolon, which is a no-op. So in that case, the code doesn't increment count, but since the outer loop is a for loop with i++, it just moves to the next i. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe outer loop is for (i=0; i<N; i++). So for each i, when processing, if the current and next are equal, it does nothing, and the loop continues. But in the case where the elements are equal, the code would not create a new segment. But perhaps when the elements are equal, they are considered part of the current trend. For example, if the previous trend was increasing, then a flat part is considered part of the same trend. Wait, the logic here is not so straightforward.\n\nWait, the Java code's logic is:\n\nStart at i=0. Check if it's the last element. If yes, count++. Otherwise, compare A[i] and A[i+1]. If they are equal, do nothing (so the loop will proceed to i+1 next). But if A[i] < A[i+1], then enter a loop that increments i until A[i] <= A[i+1], then increment count. Similarly for A[i] > A[i+1].\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n   if (i is last element) count++\n\n   else if (A[i] == A[i+1]) { do nothing }\n\n   else if (A[i] < A[i+1]) {\n\n       while (A[i] <= A[i+1]) {\n\n           i++;\n\n           if (i is last) break;\n\n       }\n\n       count++;\n\n   }\n\n   else {\n\n       while (A[i] >= A[i+1]) {\n\n           i++;\n\n           if (i is last) break;\n\n       }\n\n       count++;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo, for example, when A[i] < A[i+1], it enters the increasing phase. It increments i as long as A[i] <= A[i+1], then counts this as one segment. Similarly for decreasing. So each segment is a maximum length sequence of either non-decreasing or non-increasing.\n\nBut how to translate this into Fortran.\n\nThe main challenge is the loop structure. In Java, the for loop increments i automatically, but inside the loop, when a trend is found, i is incremented further. So in Fortran, we can't use a simple do loop with a fixed step. Instead, we need to use a loop that allows manual control of the index.\n\nSo perhaps, in Fortran, we can have a variable i starting at 1, and a loop that continues until i > N.\n\nWait, let's outline the steps:\n\nInitialize count = 0\n\ni = 1\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   if (i == N) then\n\n       count = count + 1\n\n       exit\n\n   endif\n\n   if (A(i) == A(i+1)) then\n\n       ! Do nothing, but how to proceed? Since in Java, after this, the loop proceeds to i++\n\n       ! So in Fortran, we just increment i by 1 and continue.\n\n       i = i + 1\n\n   else if (A(i) < A(i+1)) then\n\n       ! Enter increasing loop\n\n       do while (A(i) <= A(i+1))\n\n           i = i + 1\n\n           if (i >= N) exit\n\n       end do\n\n       count = count + 1\n\n       i = i + 1\n\n   else\n\n       ! Enter decreasing loop\n\n       do while (A(i) >= A(i+1))\n\n           i = i + 1\n\n           if (i >= N) exit\n\n       end do\n\n       count = count + 1\n\n       i = i + 1\n\n   endif\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java's code, after the inner while loop (for increasing or decreasing), the code increments count and proceeds. But in Java's for loop, after processing the inner loop, the outer loop's i++ would also increment. But in Java, the inner loop has already increased i, so perhaps in the Fortran code, after the inner loop, we need to increment i again?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the Java code is processing an increasing sequence. The outer loop starts at i. The code enters the while loop, which increments i until the sequence stops increasing. Then count is increased by 1. Then, the next iteration of the outer loop starts with i++ (since it's a for loop). So in Fortran, after the inner loop, we need to increment i once more.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Java:\n\nIn the case of A[i] < A[i+1], the code enters the while loop. Let's say i starts at 0.\n\nWhile (A[i] <= A[i+1]) {\n\n   i++\n\n   if (i == N-1) break;\n\n}\n\nAfter this, count is incremented. Then the outer for loop does i++ again.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because after the inner loop, the code exits, increments count, and then the outer loop's i++ would increment i again. So for example, if the inner loop takes i from 0 to 3, then after the inner loop, i is 4 (assuming N is 5, so indexes 0-4). Then the outer loop's i++ would take it to 5, which is beyond N-1, so the loop exits.\n\nBut in the code, after the inner loop, the code has count++, and then the outer loop increments i again.\n\nWait, perhaps in the Java code, the inner loops (the while loops) are moving i to the end of the current segment. Then, count is increased by 1. Then the outer loop's next iteration starts at i+1.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the outer loop is a for loop, which increments i each time. So the code's logic is:\n\nFor each i from 0 to N-1:\n\nProcess i, which may skip ahead several steps via the inner loops, but since the outer loop is a for loop, after processing the current i, the next i is i+1 (after the loop body, the for loop increments i). Wait, no. The for loop's increment is done after each iteration. So when inside the loop body, you modify i, the next iteration's i is the modified value plus one.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify with an example. Suppose the loop is:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n\n   if (i == 2) i = 4;\n\n}\n\nThe first iteration i=0: no condition, loop runs, after body, i becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration i=1: no condition, after body, i=2.\n\nThird iteration i=2: inside body, i is set to 4. After the body, i is incremented to 5. So loop ends.\n\nSo, the for loop increments i after each iteration. So modifying i inside the loop body will affect the current iteration, and the next i is the modified value plus 1.\n\nIn the Java code, in the case where the inner loop increments i several times, when the inner loop exits, the outer loop's i is that value. Then, after the loop body, the for loop increments i again.\n\nSo for example:\n\nSuppose in the outer loop, i is 0. Then, inside the code, in the increasing case, the inner loop increments i to 3. Then, after the inner loop, count is increased by 1. Then, the outer loop's for loop increments i to 4, and the next iteration is with i=4.\n\nBut if during the inner loop, i reaches N-1 (like 4 in a 5-element array), then after the inner loop exits, count is increased, and the outer loop increments i to 5, which is beyond the loop condition (i < N), so the loop exits.\n\nHmm. So in the Java code, each time a segment is processed, the i is advanced to the end of the segment, then the outer loop's i++ takes it to the next element, but perhaps that's beyond the array.\n\nSo, to translate this to Fortran, we need to manage the index correctly.\n\nIn Fortran, since arrays are 1-based, we'll start i at 1.\n\nThe main loop in Fortran will be:\n\ni = 1\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   if (i == N) then\n\n       count = count + 1\n\n       exit\n\n   end if\n\n   if (A(i) == A(i+1)) then\n\n       i = i + 1\n\n   else if (A(i) < A(i+1)) then\n\n       ! increasing segment\n\n       do while (i < N .and. A(i) <= A(i+1))\n\n           i = i + 1\n\n       end do\n\n       count = count + 1\n\n       i = i + 1\n\n   else\n\n       ! decreasing segment\n\n       do while (i < N .and. A(i) >= A(i+1))\n\n           i = i + 1\n\n       end do\n\n       count = count + 1\n\n       i = i + 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after processing a segment, the outer loop's i is incremented again. So after the inner loop, which moves i to the end of the segment, the code increments count, and then the outer loop's i++ (Java) would take it to the next element. So in Fortran, after processing the inner loop, we have to increment i once more.\n\nBut let's test with an example.\n\nSuppose N=5, and the array is [1,2,3,2,1].\n\nJava code:\n\ni starts at 0. Since 1 < 2, enter the increasing loop. The while loop runs as long as A[i] <= A[i+1]. So:\n\ni=0: A[0]=1 <= A[1]=2 \u2192 increment i to 1.\n\ni=1: A[1]=2 <= A[2]=3 \u2192 increment i to 2.\n\ni=2: A[2]=3 > A[3]=2 \u2192 exit loop. Then count becomes 1. Then, the outer loop's i++ increments i to 3.\n\nNext iteration: i=3. Check if it's last (N-1=4? No, since N=5, indexes 0-4. i=3 is not last. Check A[3]=2 vs A[4]=1. 2 >1 \u2192 enter decreasing loop.\n\nWhile A[i] >= A[i+1]. i=3: 2 >=1 \u2192 increment i to4 (which is N-1). Then loop condition: check if i < N-1? No, so break. Exit loop. count becomes 2. Then outer loop's i++ takes i to5, loop ends. So total count is 2.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nThe array is 1-based. So elements 1-5: [1,2,3,2,1].\n\ni starts at 1.\n\nCheck i <=5.\n\ni is not 5. A(1)=1 < A(2)=2 \u2192 enter increasing loop.\n\nLoop while i <5 and A(i) <=A(i+1):\n\ni=1: 1 <=2 \u2192 i becomes 2.\n\ni=2: 2 <=3 \u2192 i becomes3.\n\ni=3: 3 <=2 \u2192 no. Exit loop.\n\ncount +=1 \u2192 count is 1.\n\nThen i is incremented by 1 \u2192 i=4.\n\nNext iteration of do loop: i=4 <=5.\n\nCheck if i is 5? No. A(4)=2, A(5)=1. 2 >1 \u2192 enter decreasing loop.\n\nLoop while i <5 and A(4)>=A(5) \u2192 yes. i becomes5. Now i=5, which is not <5 \u2192 exit loop.\n\ncount +=1 \u2192 count=2.\n\ni is incremented by1 \u2192 i=6. Do loop exits.\n\nTotal count is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: N=1.\n\nJava code: count is 1. Fortran code: i=1 is equal to N=1 \u2192 count increases by 1 and exit.\n\nAnother test case: N=3, array [1,1,1].\n\nJava code:\n\ni=0: not last. A[0] == A[1]. Do nothing. Loop increments i to1.\n\ni=1: not last. A[1]==A[2]. Do nothing. Loop increments i to2.\n\ni=2: which is N-1=2. count becomes 1. So total count 1.\n\nFortran code:\n\ni starts at 1. Since not last (N=3). A(1)=1 == A(2)=1. So i becomes2. Next iteration: i=2. Not last. A(2)=1 == A(3)=1. i becomes3. Next iteration: i=3. Which is equal to N=3. count +=1. So total 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: N=4, [1,2,2,3].\n\nJava code:\n\ni=0. A[0] <A[1]. Enter increasing loop. Check while A[i] <= A[i+1].\n\ni=0: 1<=2 \u2192 i=1.\n\nA[1]=2 <=2 \u2192 i=2.\n\nA[2]=2 <=3 \u2192 i=3. Now i=3, which is N-1=3. Break loop. count +=1. Then outer loop increments i to4, loop ends. So count is 1.\n\nFortran code:\n\ni=1. A(1)=1 < A(2)=2. Enter loop.\n\nLoop: i<4 and A(i) <=A(i+1).\n\ni=1: 1<=2 \u2192 i=2.\n\nA(2)=2 <=2 \u2192 i=3.\n\nA(3)=2 <=3 \u2192 i=4. Now i=4. i<4 is false. Exit loop. count +=1. Then i becomes5. Loop ends. So count 1. Correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code structure seems correct.\n\nNow, translating the code.\n\nFirst, reading N and the array.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, count\n    integer, allocatable :: A(:)\n    \n    read(*,*) N\n    allocate(A(N))\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*,*) A(i)\n    end do\n    \n    count = 0\n    i = 1\n    \n    do while (i <= N)\n        if (i == N) then\n            count = count + 1\n            exit\n        end if\n        \n        if (A(i) == A(i+1)) then\n            i = i + 1\n        else if (A(i) < A(i+1)) then\n            do while (i < N .and. A(i) <= A(i+1))\n                i = i + 1\n            end do\n            count = count + 1\n            i = i + 1\n        else\n            do while (i < N .and. A(i) >= A(i+1))\n                i = i + 1\n            end do\n            count = count + 1\n            i = i + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n    \n    print *, count\n    \n    deallocate(A)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the Fortran code, the first check in the do while loop is if i == N. So when i reaches N, count is increased by 1, and exit. But in the Java code, when i is N-1 (last element), count is increased by 1. So in Fortran, when i is N (last element), count is increased. That's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the inner loops (the do while loops), when i < N is checked first. Because in Fortran, the condition is evaluated left to right, so if i < N is false, the second condition (A(i) ...) is not evaluated, which prevents out-of-bounds array access.\n\nFor example, in the increasing case:\n\ndo while (i < N .and. A(i) <= A(i+1))\n\nIf i reaches N, then i < N is false, and the loop exits. So A(i+1) is not accessed when i is N.\n\nYes, that's safe.\n\nTesting this code with various examples should give the correct result.\n\nNow, code formatting: Fortran is case-insensitive, but the code here uses lowercase for keywords. Variables are in uppercase as per code style. Or perhaps it's up to the user. The given code uses lowercase for keywords (like if, do while, etc.), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the final code is as written above."
