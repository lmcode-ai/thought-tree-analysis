    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The main part is a loop where two players take turns reducing resources x and y based on certain conditions. The canTake function checks if there are enough resources to proceed with a certain action. The main loop alternates between players, with different priority of actions depending on whose turn it is.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to represent the canTake function in Fortran. In Java, it's a boolean function that returns true if the needed amounts are less than or equal to the available. Fortran uses logical functions, so that's straightforward. The function will take four integer arguments and return a logical value.\n\nNext, the main program. In Java, they read input using BufferedReader and StringTokenizer. Fortran uses READ statements. So, I can read the input line as two integers. Then, the variables x, y, turn are initialized. The loop is an infinite loop, which in Fortran can be a DO loop with an exit condition when one of the players can't make a move.\n\nWait, the loop in Java is a while(true), so in Fortran, DO WHILE (.TRUE.) or just a loop with EXIT when certain conditions are met. Each iteration represents a turn. The turn variable alternates between even and odd (0 and increments each turn), determining which player's turn it is.\n\nFor each turn, depending on whether it's even (turn%2 ==0), the code checks conditions in a specific order. For turn%2 ==0 (Hanako's turn), the order is check 2x and 2y, then 1x and 12y, then 0x and 22y. If none can be taken, Hanako loses, so print \"Hanako\" and exit. Else, subtract the resources. Else, for the other player (Ciel), the order is reversed: check 0x and 22y first, then 1x and 12y, then 2x and 2y. If none, Ciel loses.\n\nSo, the challenge is to structure these conditions in Fortran with if-else blocks. Also, Fortran's case is case-insensitive, but I'll use uppercase for keywords for clarity.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Declare variables: x, y, turn as integers. Initialize turn to 0.\n\n2. Read the input line into x and y.\n\n3. Start an infinite loop. In Fortran, this can be done with a DO loop that has no exit condition except when a RETURN or STOP is encountered.\n\n4. For each iteration, check if turn is even or odd.\n\n5. Depending on the turn, check the conditions in order. For even turns (Hanako):\n\n   a. If canTake(2, x, 2, y) is true: subtract 2 from x and y.\n\n   b. Else, check canTake(1, x, 12, y): subtract 1 and 12.\n\n   c. Else, check canTake(0, x, 22, y): subtract 22 from y.\n\n   d. Else, print \"Hanako\" and exit.\n\nFor odd turns (Ciel):\n\n   a. Check canTake(0, x, 22, y): subtract 22 y.\n\n   b. Else, check canTake(1, x, 12, y): subtract 1 and 12.\n\n   c. Else, check canTake(2, x, 2, y): subtract 2 and 2.\n\n   d. Else, print \"Ciel\" and exit.\n\nAfter each successful subtraction, increment turn and continue the loop.\n\nNow, implement the canTake function. In Fortran, functions can be written as:\n\nLOGICAL FUNCTION canTake(xNeeded, xAvailable, yNeeded, yAvailable)\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: xNeeded, xAvailable, yNeeded, yAvailable\n    canTake = (xNeeded <= xAvailable) .AND. (yNeeded <= yAvailable)\nEND FUNCTION canTake\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variable names are case-insensitive. So the parameters can be lowercase. Also, the function can be inside a CONTAINS section if it's in the main program.\n\nWait, the structure of Fortran programs: the main program can have internal procedures via CONTAINS. So the function can be defined after the main code with CONTAINS.\n\nSo the main program will be:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_79_A\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER :: x, y, turn\n    LOGICAL :: canTake\n    ! Read input\n    READ(*,*) x, y\n    turn = 0\n    DO\n        IF (MOD(turn, 2) == 0) THEN\n            ! Hanako's turn\n            IF (canTake(2, x, 2, y)) THEN\n                x = x - 2\n                y = y - 2\n            ELSE IF (canTake(1, x, 12, y)) THEN\n                x = x - 1\n                y = y - 12\n            ELSE IF (canTake(0, x, 22, y)) THEN\n                y = y - 22\n            ELSE\n                PRINT *, 'Hanako'\n                EXIT\n            END IF\n        ELSE\n            ! Ciel's turn\n            IF (canTake(0, x, 22, y)) THEN\n                y = y - 22\n            ELSE IF (canTake(1, x, 12, y)) THEN\n                x = x - 1\n                y = y - 12\n            ELSE IF (canTake(2, x, 2, y)) THEN\n                x = x - 2\n                y = y - 2\n            ELSE\n                PRINT *, 'Ciel'\n                EXIT\n            END IF\n        END IF\n        turn = turn + 1\n    END DO\nCONTAINS\n    LOGICAL FUNCTION canTake(xNeeded, xAvailable, yNeeded, yAvailable)\n        INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: xNeeded, xAvailable, yNeeded, yAvailable\n        canTake = (xNeeded <= xAvailable) .AND. (yNeeded <= yAvailable)\n    END FUNCTION canTake\nEND PROGRAM codeforces_79_A\n\nWait, but in the main program, the variables x and y are modified each iteration. So during each turn, the available amounts are checked and subtracted if possible.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In Fortran, function arguments are passed by default with INTENT(IN) unless specified. Wait, no: in Fortran, the default is INTENT(INOUT). But in the canTake function, the parameters are xNeeded, xAvailable, etc., which are inputs. So to avoid modifying them (which is not possible here, but good practice), declare them with INTENT(IN).\n\nWhich is done in the function definition.\n\nTesting this code:\n\nFor example, when x and y are sufficient for 2,2, then subtract. Else, proceed.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran's logical if conditions. The canTake function returns a logical value, so the conditions in the IF statements are correctly evaluated.\n\nAlso, when subtracting from x and y, make sure that the values don't go negative. But since canTake checks that the needed amounts are available, subtracting them is safe.\n\nWhat about the order of checking the conditions? In Java, the code checks in a specific order, and the first condition that passes is taken. The Fortran code does the same with ELSE IF.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran requires that variables are declared. So in the main program, x, y, turn are declared as integers.\n\nThe READ statement: using READ(*,*) x, y should read the two integers from the input line.\n\nSo, the code should work similarly to the Java code.\n\nLet me check possible edge cases.\n\nFor example, when x is 0 and y is 22: on Hanako's turn, the third condition is met (0x and 22y), so subtract 22 from y. Then turn increments. Next, Ciel's turn: check 0x and 22y. But if y is now 0, then canTake(0, x, 22, 0) would be 22 <=0? No. So it would check next conditions.\n\nBut in the code, after the subtraction, the next turn proceeds.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should be as written above."
