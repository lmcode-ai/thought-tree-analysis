    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nSo, the Java program reads two integers, n and count. Then it calls printIsland. The printIsland function checks if count is greater than the maximum possible 'L's, which is calculated as a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 where a is (n+1)/2 and b is n/2. If count exceeds this max, it prints NO. Otherwise, it prints YES and then a grid of n x n where 'L's are placed in cells where (i+j) is even, until count reaches zero. The rest are 'S's.\n\nHmm. Fortran has some differences from Java. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, in Java, they use Scanner for input. In Fortran, I'll use READ(*,*) to get the inputs. Then, the printIsland function. Since Fortran uses subroutines, I'll create a subroutine for that.\n\nThe variables: n and count are integers. Then a and b are computed as (n+1)/2 and n/2. Wait, in Java, integer division truncates. So in Fortran, I need to use integer division, which also truncates. So a = (n+1)/2. For example, if n is 5, (5+1)/2=3, which is correct. Similarly for b.\n\nThen max is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. Check if count > max. If yes, output NO. Otherwise, output YES and the grid.\n\nThe grid is built by iterating i from 0 to n-1 (since Java uses 0-based), but Fortran typically uses 1-based indices. Wait, but in the loop, in Java it's for (i=0; i < n; i++), so loops n times. So in Fortran, we can loop i from 1 to n. Then for each row, build a string where for each j from 0 to n-1 (Java's j loop), check (i+j) even. Wait, but in Fortran, the indices are 1-based. Wait, original code in Java uses i and j starting at 0. So (i + j) % 2 == 0. So when i and j are 0-based.\n\nIf I loop i from 0 to n-1 in Fortran, but in Fortran array indices usually start at 1. Wait, but maybe for the loops, we can start from 0. Alternatively, adjust the formula. Let's see.\n\nWait, the key is that (i + j) mod 2. So if we have i from 0 to n-1, and j from 0 to n-1, then (i+j) mod 2. But in Fortran, if I loop i from 1 to n, and j from 1 to n, then (i-1 + j-1) mod 2 is equivalent to (i+j-2) mod 2, which is same as (i+j) mod 2. So perhaps it's easier to keep the loops from 1 to n and adjust the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in Fortran, we can start the loops from 0 to n-1. But Fortran doesn't care as long as the indices are properly handled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just use 1-based loops and compute (i-1 + j-1) mod 2. For example, when i=1, j=1, then (0+0) mod 2=0. Which is same as original Java's i=0,j=0. So the condition would be (i-1 + j-1) % 2 ==0.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to keep the same logic as Java. Let's see.\n\nIn the Java code, for each row i (0-based), and each column j (0-based), if (i+j) even, then place 'L' if count>0. So in Fortran, if we loop i from 1 to n, j from 1 to n, then (i-1 + j-1) mod 2 is same as (i+j-2) mod 2. Which is same as (i+j) mod 2 minus 2 mod 2. Since 2 mod 2 is 0, so (i+j-2) mod 2 is same as (i+j) mod 2. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, (i-1 + j-1) = i + j -2. So (i + j -2) mod 2 is equivalent to (i + j) mod 2 minus 2 mod 2, which is same as (i+j) mod 2. Because 2 mod 2 is 0. So (i + j -2) mod 2 = (i + j) mod 2. So in Fortran, if i and j start at 1, then (i + j) mod 2 is the same as (i-1 + j-1) mod 2. So the parity is the same as the original Java code's (i + j) mod 2. So no problem here.\n\nWait, wait. Wait (i-1 + j-1) is equal to (i + j - 2). Then (i + j - 2) mod 2 is equal to (i + j) mod 2. Because subtracting 2 (even) doesn't change the parity. So yes, for example:\n\nIf i=1, j=1: (1-1)+(1-1) =0 \u2192 even. So in Java, i=0, j=0: same. So same result.\n\nIf i=1, j=2: 0 +1=1 \u2192 odd. Java i=0,j=1: same.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the condition can be (i + j) mod 2 == 0, because i and j start at 1. Wait, no. Because when i and j start at 1, their sum can be even or odd. Let's see:\n\nOriginal Java code checks (i + j) % 2 ==0, where i and j are 0-based. So in Fortran, if i and j are 1-based, the sum is (i-1 + j-1) = i +j -2. The mod 2 of that is same as (i + j) mod 2. Because (i +j -2) mod 2 = (i +j) mod 2 - 2 mod 2 = same as (i+j) mod 2. So the parity is same. So in Fortran, the condition (i + j) mod 2 ==0 will be equivalent to the Java code's (i +j) mod 2 ==0, but with i and j starting from 1 instead of 0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's take an example. Suppose i=0 and j=0 in Java. Then sum is 0, mod 2 is 0 \u2192 'L'.\n\nIn Fortran, if i and j start at 1, then (i-1)+(j-1) =0 \u2192 same sum. So when i=1 and j=1 in Fortran, (i + j) mod 2 is (1+1)=2 mod2=0. So same result. So the condition in Fortran would be (i + j) mod 2 ==0, which would give the same pattern as the Java code.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the loops can be i from 1 to n, j from 1 to n. And the condition is (i + j) mod 2 ==0. That's correct.\n\nSo, the grid in Fortran can be constructed by building each line as a character string. For each row, create a string of length n. For each position, if (i + j) is even and count >0, then 'L' and decrement count. Else, 'S'.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are fixed-length, so perhaps we can build each line as a character variable of length n. Then, for each character in the line, decide whether to put 'L' or 'S'.\n\nNow, let's think about the Fortran code structure.\n\nThe main program will read n and count, then call the subroutine. The subroutine will compute a and b, check if count exceeds max. Then output 'YES' or 'NO'. If yes, then output the grid.\n\nIn Fortran, we can't have a subroutine that just returns like the Java method. So we need to structure the code accordingly.\n\nFirst, the main program:\n\nprogram codeforces_544_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, count\n    read(*,*) n, count\n    call printIsland(n, count)\nend program codeforces_544_B\n\nThen the subroutine:\n\nsubroutine printIsland(n, count)\n    implicit none\n    integer, intent(in) :: n, count\n    integer :: a, b, max_val, current_count, i, j\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: line\n    current_count = count\n\n    a = (n + 1) / 2\n    b = n / 2\n    max_val = a**2 + b**2\n\n    if (current_count > max_val) then\n        print *, 'NO'\n        return\n    end if\n\n    print *, 'YES'\n    allocate(character(len=n) :: line)\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        line = ''\n        do j = 1, n\n            if (mod(i + j, 2) == 0 .and. current_count > 0) then\n                line(j:j) = 'L'\n                current_count = current_count - 1\n            else\n                line(j:j) = 'S'\n            end if\n        end do\n        print *, line\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(line)\nend subroutine printIsland\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you allocate a character variable with len=n, then line(j:j) can be assigned. But initializing line to all 'S' first may be needed. Wait, but the code above starts with line = '' which would set it to empty. Hmm, maybe not. Because in Fortran, when you allocate a character(len=n) variable, each time you assign a string, it is padded with spaces or truncated. So perhaps initializing each line as all 'S's first, then replacing with 'L's where needed.\n\nAlternatively, building each line character by character.\n\nWait, in the code above, for each i from 1 to n (rows), loop j from 1 to n (columns). For each j, set line(j:j) to 'L' or 'S' based on the condition.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you create a character variable of length n, and you assign to line(j:j), each position is set. So for each row, we can initialize the line to all 'S's first, then check for positions where (i+j) is even and current_count >0, and replace with 'L's.\n\nWait, but in Java, the code builds the line by appending 'L' or 'S's. But in the Java code, the first condition is (i+j) even and count>0. So for each cell in the grid, in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom), if (i+j) is even and there are remaining counts, then 'L', else 'S'.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should iterate over each cell in the same order, and assign 'L' when possible.\n\nBut in the Java code, the order is left to right, top to bottom. So for each row (i), from j=0 to j =n-1. So in Fortran, for i from 1 to n, j from 1 to n.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor each row i (1 to n):\n\n   For each column j (1 to n):\n\n      if (i + j) mod 2 is 0 and current_count >0 \u2192 'L', decrement current_count.\n\n      else \u2192 'S'.\n\nSo the line is built by checking each j in order, left to right.\n\nIn Fortran, the code can do that. For each row, create a line of length n. Initialize it as all 'S's. Then for each j, check the condition and set to 'L' if possible.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the line is initially empty, and in each j loop, the code sets line(j:j). But initializing the line as 'S's first would be better. Otherwise, the line may have spaces (if not initialized), which is not desired. Because in Fortran, when you allocate a character variable, the initial content is undefined. So perhaps, for each row, we initialize the line to 'S's first, then replace with 'L's where needed.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    line = repeat('S', n)  ! Initialize the line with all 'S's\n    do j = 1, n\n        if (mod(i + j, 2) == 0 .and. current_count > 0) then\n            line(j:j) = 'L'\n            current_count = current_count - 1\n        end if\n    end do\n    print *, line\nend do\n\nThis way, the line is first filled with 'S's, then we check each position. If the condition is met, replace with 'L' and decrease the count. Otherwise, leave as 'S'.\n\nYes, this would work.\n\nBut how to initialize the line with 'S's. The repeat function can be used. For example, line = repeat('S', n).\n\nBut in Fortran, the line is declared as a deferred-length allocatable character variable. So when we allocate it with len = n, then line = repeat('S',n) would set the entire string to 'SSSS...'.\n\nYes. So in the code, after allocating line with len=n, for each row, set line to 'SSS...', then loop through j and replace 'S' with 'L' where needed.\n\nThis approach would be correct.\n\nNow, let's check the variables. current_count is a copy of the input count. Because in Fortran, the subroutine's count is intent(in), so we can't modify it. So the code uses current_count = count, and then modifies that.\n\nSo, in the subroutine, current_count is initialized to the input count, then decremented as 'L's are placed.\n\nWait, but in Java, the count is passed as a parameter, and modified in the method. But in Fortran, the subroutine's count is intent(in), so can't be modified. So the code must create a local variable, current_count, which is initialized to the input count, and decremented.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the calculation of a and b. a = (n+1)/2, which in integer division. For example, if n is 5, (5+1)/2=3. If n is 4, (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 but integer division in Fortran truncates towards zero. So (5+1)/2=3, (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2. So same as Java.\n\nThen max_val is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. So correct.\n\nSo the code checks if current_count > max_val \u2192 output NO.\n\nOtherwise, output YES, and the grid.\n\nNow, the code for printing the grid. Each line is printed as a string. In Fortran, when you print *, line, it may add a leading space. But in the Java code, each line is printed without any leading space. So perhaps using write statements with format to avoid leading space.\n\nFor example, instead of print *, line, use write(*, '(a)') line. Because in Fortran, list-directed output (print *) may add leading spaces. Using a format to output the line as-is would be better.\n\nSo, replacing the print *, line with write(*, '(a)') trim(line) ?\n\nWait, but line has length exactly n, so trimming would remove trailing spaces, but in the code, the line is filled with 'S's and 'L's. So trim is unnecessary, but if the line is initialized with 'S's, then all characters are 'S's or 'L's, so the line is full. So no trailing spaces.\n\nWait, no. The line is allocated as len=n. So when you assign line = repeat('S',n), line is of length n, filled with 'S's. Then, when you set line(j:j) to 'L's, the length remains n. So when printed, the line is exactly n characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you print a character variable with print *, it may add a leading space. To avoid that, using a format that outputs the line without any leading space.\n\nSo using write(*, '(a)') line.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the code, instead of print *, line, use write(*, '(a)') line.\n\nSo modifying the code inside the loop:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)') line\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe subroutine:\n\nsubroutine printIsland(n, count)\n    implicit none\n    integer, intent(in) :: n, count\n    integer :: a, b, max_val, current_count, i, j\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: line\n\n    a = (n + 1) / 2\n    b = n / 2\n    max_val = a**2 + b**2\n    current_count = count\n\n    if (current_count > max_val) then\n        write(*, '(a)') 'NO'\n        return\n    end if\n\n    write(*, '(a)') 'YES'\n\n    allocate(character(len=n) :: line)\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        line = repeat('S', n)  ! Initialize the line with all 'S's\n        do j = 1, n\n            if (mod(i + j, 2) == 0 .and. current_count > 0) then\n                line(j:j) = 'L'\n                current_count = current_count - 1\n            end if\n        end do\n        write(*, '(a)') line\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(line)\nend subroutine printIsland\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, when (i + j) is even and count is positive, 'L' is placed and count is decremented. So even if count reaches zero during the loop, the rest of the cells are 'S's. The Fortran code does the same.\n\nNow, testing for example, n=3, count=2.\n\nmax_val is a= (3+1)/2=2, b=1. max=4 +1=5. count=2 <=5 \u2192 YES.\n\nLoop for i=1 to 3:\n\ni=1:\n\nj runs from 1 to 3.\n\ni + j:\n\n1+1=2 \u2192 even \u2192 if current_count >0 (2>0): yes. line[1]='L', count becomes 1.\n\nj=2: i+j=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 'S'.\n\nj=3: i+j=4 \u2192 even. count=1>0 \u2192 'L', count=0.\n\nSo line is L S L.\n\nThen i=2:\n\ni=2. j=1: 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 'S'.\n\nj=2: 4 \u2192 even. but count is 0. So 'S'.\n\nj=3:5 \u2192 odd.\n\nSo line S S S.\n\ni=3:\n\nj=1: 4 \u2192 even. count=0 \u2192 'S'.\n\nj=2:5 \u2192 odd.\n\nj=3:6 \u2192 even, but count=0.\n\nSo all lines:\n\nLSL\n\nSSS\n\nSSS\n\nWhich matches the Java code's output.\n\nAnother example: n=2, count=2.\n\na= (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 1 (since integer division truncates). b=1.\n\nmax_val=1 +1=2. count=2 \u2192 yes.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=1: 1+1=2 \u2192 even. count=2>0 \u2192 'L' (count=1).\n\nj=2: 1+2=3 \u2192 odd. 'S'.\n\nline is L S.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=1: 2+1=3 \u2192 odd.\n\nj=2: 2+2=4 \u2192 even. count=1>0 \u2192 'L' (count=0).\n\nline is S L.\n\nSo output:\n\nLS\n\nSL\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases correctly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Fortran's integer division: when (n+1) is even, like n=5, (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\n- When initializing line as 'S's, then replacing with 'L's where possible.\n\n- The order of processing j from 1 to n, same as left to right, top to bottom.\n\nSo the code seems correct."
