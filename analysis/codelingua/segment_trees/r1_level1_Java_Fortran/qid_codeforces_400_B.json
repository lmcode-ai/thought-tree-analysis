So for example, if 'G' is not found (dexG=0), 'S' is found (dexS=3), then length would be 3-0=3. But in Java code, it's 3 - (-1) =4. So that's different. This suggests a problem.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads n and m from input. Then it reads n strings, each of length m. For each string, it finds the positions of 'G' and 'S'. If 'G' comes after 'S' (dexG > dexS), it sets returnDex to -1. Otherwise, it calculates the difference between the S and G positions and stores it in the length array. Then, it adds all these differences to a set to count unique values. If returnDex is -1, it outputs -1; else, the size of the set.\n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash set, so I'll need to handle the uniqueness manually. Also, Fortran uses 1-based indexing, unlike Java's 0-based. So when finding positions, I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read n strings.\n3. For each string:\n   a. Find the index of 'G' and 'S'.\n   b. Check if G's index is after S's. If so, set returnDex to -1.\n   c. Compute the difference (S - G) and store in an array.\n4. Collect all unique differences.\n5. Output -1 if returnDex is -1, else the number of unique differences.\n\nFirst, variables. In Fortran, I'll need to declare variables. Let's see:\n\nn and m are integers. The strings can be stored in an array of character strings. The length array will be an integer array. For the unique elements, maybe use an array and check for duplicates as we add them.\n\nNow, reading input. Fortran uses read statements. For reading n and m, that's straightforward.\n\nFor reading the strings: each string is of length m, so when declaring the array, each element should have length m. So, character(len=m) :: arrs(n), but m is read at runtime. Wait, in Fortran, the length of a character variable must be a compile-time constant unless using allocatable or parameterized derived types. So perhaps using allocatable arrays. But maybe better to read each string into a variable with sufficient length. Alternatively, since all strings are length m, perhaps read them as such. Let me think: When m is read from input, we can declare the array with len=m. But in Fortran, when you declare a character array with a variable length, that's not allowed. Wait, no, the length must be a constant. So perhaps, the code will need to read the strings into a character variable of fixed maximum length. But in practice, the input strings are of length m. So perhaps using a temporary variable of len=1000 (assuming m isn't larger than that). Or use a dynamic approach. Alternatively, in Fortran 2003, we can use deferred-length character variables with allocatable. Let me see.\n\nSo, in Fortran, we can do:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: arrs(:)\n\nBut then, for each string, we read it into a variable and then allocate the array elements. Hmm. Alternatively, read all the strings into an array of fixed length, but with a length that's sufficient. Let's say m is up to, say, 1000. So declare the array as:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: arrs(n)\n\nBut then, when reading, each input line is m characters. So when reading, we can read into arrs(i)(1:m). Wait, but in Fortran, if the input line is shorter than the declared length, it's padded with spaces. But the problem's input probably gives each string as exactly m characters. So using:\n\nread *, arrs(i)(1:m)\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to read the entire string and then process the first m characters. Alternatively, read into a variable and then assign. Maybe not. Let's proceed.\n\nFor each string in arrs:\n\nLoop from i=1 to n.\n\nFor each string, find the positions of 'G' and 'S'.\n\nIn Fortran, the index function can be used. index(string, 'G') gives the position of 'G' in the string. But since Fortran is 1-based, the positions will start at 1. So in Java, if the index is 0-based, the Fortran index is 1-based. So for the Java code's dexG and dexS, in Fortran, they are the same as index returns.\n\nBut in the Java code, if 'G' is not found, indexOf returns -1. Similarly for 'S'. So we need to handle that. Wait, in the problem's context, each string has exactly one 'G' and one 'S'? Because the original code uses indexOf, which returns the first occurrence. But the problem's constraints probably ensure that each row has exactly one G and one S. Otherwise, if one is missing, the Java code's dexG or dexS would be -1, leading to dexG > dexS (if either is -1). But according to the problem's logic, the code checks if G's position is after S's. So in that case, returnDex is set to -1.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each string, find the position of 'G' and 'S'. The index function returns 0 if the substring is not found. So we need to check if either is 0.\n\nWait, no. The index function in Fortran returns the starting position of the substring. For a single character, index(string, 'G') gives the position of 'G' in the string, or 0 if not found.\n\nSo for each string tmp in arrs:\n\ndexG = index(tmp, 'G')\n\ndexS = index(tmp, 'S')\n\nIf dexG == 0 or dexS == 0, then in Java code, the indexOf would return -1. So if in Java, dexG is -1 or dexS is -1, then dexG > dexS could be possible. For example, if a string has no 'G', then dexG is -1, which is less than dexS (if dexS is valid). But in the Java code, if dexG > dexS is true, returnDex is set to -1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, if either 'G' or 'S' is not present, then dexG or dexS would be -1. So for example, if dexG is -1 (no G), and dexS is 3 (S is present), then dexG (=-1) is less than dexS (3), so no problem. But if S is not present (dexS is -1), then dexG could be 3, which is > -1. Then returnDex becomes -1.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to check if either dexG or dexS is zero (since index returns 0 if not found). If either is zero, then we need to check if dexG > dexS. But since in Fortran, dexG and dexS are 0 if not found. So for example, if dexG is 0 and dexS is 5: 0 >5 is false. So that's okay. If dexG is 5 and dexS is 0: 5>0 is true, so returnDex becomes -1.\n\nSo the logic is: if (dexG > dexS) then returnDex = -1. But if either is zero, then this condition could be true. For example, if dexS is zero (S not found), and dexG is 3, then 3>0 is true, so returnDex is set to -1.\n\nSo in Fortran, the condition if (dexG > dexS) then set returnDex to -1. But we need to handle the case where either is 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ninteger :: dexG, dexS\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   dexG = index(arrs(i), 'G')\n\n   dexS = index(arrs(i), 'S')\n\n   if (dexG == 0 .or. dexS == 0) then\n\n       ! Handle cases where one is missing\n\n       ! But according to problem's input constraints, maybe this doesn't happen?\n\n       ! But the code must account for it.\n\n       if (dexG > dexS) then\n\n           returnDex = -1\n\n       endif\n\n   else\n\n       if (dexG > dexS) then\n\n           returnDex = -1\n\n       endif\n\n   endif\n\n   ! Then compute length as dexS - dexG, but only if both are present.\n\n   if (dexG /= 0 .and. dexS /=0) then\n\n       length(i) = dexS - dexG\n\n   else\n\n       ! What to do? Because in Java, if either is not present, then length is (dexS - dexG) where one is -1.\n\n       ! For example, if dexG is 3 and dexS is 0 (not found), then in Java, dexS is -1, so dexS - dexG is -4.\n\n       ! But in the Java code, the length array is filled regardless. Then added to the set. So negative values would be possible.\n\n       ! Wait, but in the Java code, if dexG > dexS (which would be, for example, 3 > -1), then returnDex is set to -1. And in that case, the code prints -1.\n\n       ! So in Fortran, if either is missing (dexG or dexS is 0), then:\n\n       ! Calculate length as (dexS - dexG). But dexS is 0 if not found, dexG is 0 if not found. So in that case:\n\n       ! For example, if dexG is 0 (not found), then in Java, dexG is -1. So in Java code, length is dexS (which is position, e.g., 3) - (-1) if dexS is found.\n\n       Wait, no. Java code's dexS is the index of 'S', which is 0-based. If 'S' is not present, dexS is -1.\n\n       So in Java, the code for length is dexS - dexG. So if, for example, 'G' is not found (dexG is -1), and 'S' is found (dexS is 3), then length is 3 - (-1) =4. But in that case, since dexG is -1 and dexS is 3, the condition (dexG > dexS) is -1 >3 \u2192 false. So returnDex remains 0.\n\n       So in Fortran, when either dexG or dexS is zero (not found), then the code's calculation of length would be (dexS - dexG), but dexS and dexG are 0 in that case. So for example, if 'G' is not found (dexG=0), 'S' is found (dexS=3), then length would be 3-0=3. But in Java code, it's 3 - (-1) =4. So that's different.\n\n       This suggests a problem. Because the Fortran code would compute a different value for length than the Java code when one of the characters is not present.\n\n       Wait, but according to the problem's logic, is it possible for the input strings to have missing 'G' or 'S'? The original code's logic is that if 'G' comes after 'S', then output is -1. So perhaps the problem's input ensures that each string has exactly one 'G' and one 'S'. Otherwise, the code's logic is undefined.\n\n       Let's check the problem's original context. The Java code is part of codeforces problem 400_B. Looking up that problem: problem 400B - Inna and New Matrix of Candies.\n\n       In that problem, each row has exactly one 'G' and one 'S'. So the code's logic is safe.\n\n       Therefore, in the Fortran code, we can assume that each string contains exactly one 'G' and one 'S'. So dexG and dexS are both non-zero. So in Fortran, we can proceed without checking for zero.\n\n       Therefore, the code can safely compute dexG and dexS as the positions (1-based) of 'G' and 'S', and compute length as dexS - dexG.\n\n       However, the Java code's length is dexS - dexG (which is the same as in Fortran, but since Java uses 0-based indexes, the difference is the same. For example, in Java, if 'G' is at index 2 (third position) and 'S' is at index 5 (sixth position), the difference is 3. In Fortran, 'G' is at 3, 'S' at 6, difference 3. So the same.\n\n       So for the problem, the code's logic holds.\n\n       So in Fortran:\n\n       For each string, find dexG and dexS. If dexG > dexS \u2192 returnDex = -1. Compute length as dexS - dexG.\n\n       Then collect all unique lengths. If returnDex is -1, output -1, else output the number of unique lengths.\n\n       Now, how to collect unique lengths. Since Fortran has no built-in hash set, we can create an array, then iterate through each length, adding it to the array only if it's not already present.\n\n       For example:\n\n       Initialize a list (array) of unique elements. Start with empty. For each length in the length array, check if it's already in the list. If not, add it. Then the size of the list is the number of unique elements.\n\n       So steps:\n\n       Initialize a max_unique variable (say, up to n elements, which is 1000 as per the problem constraints). So declare an array unique_lengths of size n, and a counter variable cnt.\n\n       For each element in the length array:\n\n           if it's not present in unique_lengths(1:cnt), then increment cnt and add it.\n\n       So code:\n\n       integer :: unique_lengths(n), cnt\n\n       cnt = 0\n\n       do i = 1, n\n\n           current_length = length(i)\n\n           found = .false.\n\n           do j = 1, cnt\n\n               if (unique_lengths(j) == current_length) then\n\n                   found = .true.\n\n                   exit\n\n               endif\n\n           enddo\n\n           if (.not. found) then\n\n               cnt = cnt + 1\n\n               unique_lengths(cnt) = current_length\n\n           endif\n\n       enddo\n\n       Then the answer is cnt.\n\n       Now, putting it all together.\n\n       Now, the Fortran code structure:\n\n       program main\n\n           implicit none\n\n           integer :: n, m, i, dexG, dexS, returnDex, cnt, j, current_length\n\n           integer, allocatable :: length(:), unique_lengths(:)\n\n           character(len=:), allocatable :: arrs(:)\n\n           logical :: found\n\n           read(*,*) n, m\n\n           allocate(character(len=m) :: arrs(n))\n\n           do i = 1, n\n\n               read(*,*) arrs(i)\n\n           enddo\n\n           allocate(length(n))\n\n           returnDex = 0\n\n           do i = 1, n\n\n               dexG = index(arrs(i), 'G')\n\n               dexS = index(arrs(i), 'S')\n\n               if (dexG > dexS) then\n\n                   returnDex = -1\n\n               endif\n\n               length(i) = dexS - dexG\n\n           enddo\n\n           if (returnDex == -1) then\n\n               write(*,*) '-1'\n\n           else\n\n               ! count unique elements in length array\n\n               allocate(unique_lengths(n))\n\n               cnt = 0\n\n               do i = 1, n\n\n                   current_length = length(i)\n\n                   found = .false.\n\n                   do j = 1, cnt\n\n                       if (unique_lengths(j) == current_length) then\n\n                           found = .true.\n\n                           exit\n\n                       endif\n\n                   enddo\n\n                   if (.not. found) then\n\n                       cnt = cnt + 1\n\n                       unique_lengths(cnt) = current_length\n\n                   endif\n\n               enddo\n\n               write(*,*) cnt\n\n           endif\n\n       end program main\n\n       But wait, in Fortran, when you use index, the position is 1-based. So for a string like 'GS', in Java, dexG is 0, dexS is 1. So in Java code, dexG is 0, dexS is 1 \u2192 dexG < dexS \u2192 no problem. Length is 1 - 0 =1.\n\n       In Fortran, dexG is 1, dexS is 2 \u2192 length 2-1=1. So same result.\n\n       So the code should be correct.\n\n       Also, need to make sure that the array arrs is read correctly. Each element is m characters long. By declaring as character(len=m) and reading into arrs(i), the input strings should be exactly m characters. So when the user inputs the strings, they must be of length m. Otherwise, the code may read incorrectly. But the problem's input ensures that.\n\n       Also, the initial allocation of arrs with length m.\n\n       So the code should work.\n\n       Testing edge cases:\n\n       For example, if all lengths are the same. Then the set size is 1.\n\n       If any string has G after S, output is -1.\n\n       Now, possible issues:\n\n       - When reading the strings in Fortran, if the input lines have trailing spaces, it might affect the index function. But the problem's input gives each row as exactly m characters, so the code should read them correctly.\n\n       Another possible issue: the index function returns the first occurrence. So if a string has multiple G's, it returns the first one, same as Java's indexOf.\n\n       So the code should handle that correctly.\n\n       So the Fortran code should be as written."
