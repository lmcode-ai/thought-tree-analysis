    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first to understand what it's doing.\n\nThe Java code reads an integer n from input, then reads n pairs of integers, storing the first elements in a list ai and the second in bi. Then it sorts both lists. If n is odd, it calculates the median of bi minus the median of ai plus 1. If even, it averages the two middle elements for both ai and bi, then computes 2*(c - b) +1, where c is the average of bi's medians and b is for ai's.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n lines, each with two integers, add to ai and bi.\n3. Sort both lists.\n4. Depending on even or odd n, compute the result.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, reading input. In Java, they use BufferedReader and read line by line. In Fortran, we'll need to read from standard input. Fortran has the read statement, maybe using a loop to read n lines.\n\nBut in the Java code, each line has two integers. So for each line, read a and b, append to ai and bi arrays.\n\nIn Fortran, dynamic arrays can be handled with allocatable arrays. So perhaps we can:\n\n- Read n.\n- Allocate ai and bi arrays of size n.\n- Loop from 1 to n, read each line's a and b, store in ai(i) and bi(i).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, they are using ArrayLists and adding elements. But the code seems to read exactly n lines, so n elements in each list. So in Fortran, fixed size arrays would suffice.\n\nNext, sorting. Fortran has intrinsic sorting functions, but they sort the array in place. So after filling ai and bi, we sort them.\n\nThen, compute the medians.\n\nFor odd n, the median is the middle element. For even n, the average of the two middle elements.\n\nIn Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default. So when n is odd, the middle index is (n+1)/2. For example, n=5, (5+1)/2=3. For even n=4, the two middle indices are 2 and 3.\n\nWait, in Java, when you sort the array list, the indexes start at 0. So for n elements, when n is odd, the middle is size/2 (integer division). For example, size 5: 5/2=2 (0-based index 2, which is third element). In Fortran, 1-based index, so for n=5, the middle is (5+1)/2=3.\n\nSo when translating the Java code's indexes:\n\nIn Java, ai.size() is n, so for n odd, the median is at index (n/2). For example, n=5, indexes 0-4, n/2 is 2 (third element). In Fortran, the same median would be at (n+1)/2. For n=5, (5+1)/2=3. So for Java's ai.get(ai.size()/2) translates to ai(n/2 +1) in Fortran? Wait, perhaps not. Let's think:\n\nJava code for even n: when n is even, the code uses ai.get(ai.size() / 2 -1) and ai.get(ai.size() / 2). So for n even, size is even. For example, n=4, size=4, size/2 is 2, so indexes 1 and 2 (0-based). So the elements at positions 1 and 2 (second and third elements in 0-based). In Fortran, for n=4, the elements are at 2 and 3 (1-based). So the Java code's ai.size()/2 -1 for even n would be (4/2) -1 = 1 (Java index), which is the second element. In Fortran, for n even, the two middle elements are at n/2 and n/2 +1. Wait, no. For n even, the two middle elements in 1-based index are n/2 and n/2 +1. For example, n=4: positions 2 and 3.\n\nSo Java's code for even n is taking the elements at indices (n/2 -1) and (n/2) (0-based). So in 1-based, that would be (n/2) and (n/2 +1). For example, n=4: Java indices 1 and 2 (0-based) are elements 2 and 3 in 1-based. So in Fortran, when n is even, the two elements are ai(n/2) and ai(n/2 +1). So the average would be (ai(n/2) + ai(n/2 +1)) / 2.\n\nSo for the Java code's:\n\nIn the even case:\n\nb is (ai.get(ai.size()/2 -1) + ai.get(ai.size()/2)) / 2.0\n\nWhich translates to (ai(n/2) + ai(n/2 +1)) / 2.0 in 1-based.\n\nSimilarly for bi.\n\nSo the Fortran code would have to handle the indices correctly.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n pairs of integers into ai and bi arrays.\n\nSort ai and bi.\n\nCheck if n is odd or even.\n\nIf odd:\n\nmedian_ai = ai( (n+1)/2 )\n\nmedian_bi = bi( (n+1)/2 )\n\nresult = (median_bi - median_ai + 1)\n\nElse:\n\nmedian_ai_low = ai(n/2)\n\nmedian_ai_high = ai(n/2 +1)\n\nb = (median_ai_low + median_ai_high) / 2.0\n\nSimilarly for bi, median_bi_low = bi(n/2), median_bi_high = bi(n/2 +1)\n\nc = (median_bi_low + median_bi_high) / 2.0\n\nresult = 2*(c - b) +1\n\nBut wait, in Java, the code uses 0.0 added to the sum to make it a double. In Fortran, since we are using real division, that's handled automatically.\n\nBut need to make sure that the division is floating point. So in Fortran, when adding two integers and dividing by 2, we can use 2.0 to force real division.\n\nNow, the output.\n\nIn Java, when n is even, the code computes (int)(2*(c - b) + 1). But in Fortran, when converting to integer, it truncates towards zero. So if (2*(c -b) +1) is something like 5.999999999, it would become 5. But Java's cast to int truncates towards zero as well. So that's probably okay.\n\nBut how to handle the integer conversion in Fortran?\n\nIn Fortran, we can use the int function. But perhaps we should use nint (nearest integer) if necessary. Wait, in Java's code, when they do (int) (2*(c -b) +1), it truncates the decimal part. For example, if the value is 5.9, it becomes 5. So in Fortran, using int() would have the same effect.\n\nBut let's check. Let's suppose that the calculation is exact. For example, if (c -b) is 2.5, then 2*(2.5) =5, plus 1 is 6. So output is 6.\n\nBut when the code is even, the formula is (2*(c -b) +1). But in Java, the code uses (int) cast. So if the calculation is 5.9999, it becomes 5. However, perhaps due to the way the medians are calculated, the result is always an integer.\n\nBut perhaps in the Java code, when n is even, the calculation (c -b) is a multiple of 0.5, so 2*(c -b) is integer. Then adding 1 gives an integer. So the cast to int is safe. But in Fortran, when we compute 2*(c -b) +1, and if that's an integer, then converting to integer is okay.\n\nBut to make sure, perhaps in Fortran, we can use the nint function (nearest integer) instead of int, but that depends on the actual value.\n\nBut given that the Java code uses integer division, perhaps the Fortran code should replicate that.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the input.\n\nIn Fortran, reading from standard input. The first line is n. Then n lines, each with two integers.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nprogram abc169e\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, stat\ninteger, allocatable :: ai(:), bi(:)\ndouble precision :: b, c, result\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(ai(n), bi(n))\n\ndo i=1, n\n    read(*,*) ai(i), bi(i)\nend do\n\ncall sort(ai)\ncall sort(bi)\n\nif (mod(n,2) == 1) then\n    result = bi( (n+1)/2 ) - ai( (n+1)/2 ) + 1\nelse\n    b = ( ai(n/2) + ai(n/2 + 1) ) / 2.0d0\n    c = ( bi(n/2) + bi(n/2 + 1) ) / 2.0d0\n    result = 2.0d0 * (c - b) + 1\nend if\n\nprint '(i0)', int(result)\n\ndeallocate(ai, bi)\n\ncontains\n\nsubroutine sort(arr)\ninteger, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\ninteger :: i, j, temp\ndo i=1, size(arr)\n    do j=i+1, size(arr)\n        if (arr(j) < arr(i)) then\n            temp = arr(i)\n            arr(i) = arr(j)\n            arr(j) = temp\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\nend subroutine sort\n\nend program abc169e\n\nWait, but the sort subroutine here is a simple bubble sort. Is that efficient enough? Well, for the purposes of code translation, perhaps the original Java code uses a sort which is O(n log n), but in Fortran, the code uses a O(n^2) bubble sort. However, for small n, this is acceptable. But the original code uses Java's Collections.sort, which is a tuned sort. So perhaps in Fortran, using the intrinsic sort would be better.\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have an intrinsic sort for arrays. Wait, actually, some Fortran compilers have extensions, but standard Fortran does not. So the code would need to implement a sort. Alternatively, use an existing implementation.\n\nBut in the Java code, the lists are sorted in ascending order. So in Fortran, the ai and bi arrays need to be sorted in ascending order.\n\nThe bubble sort in the code above is a simple but inefficient method. But perhaps for code translation, it's acceptable. Alternatively, implement a quicksort or use the Fortran's intrinsic function if available.\n\nBut since the original Java code uses a proper sort, perhaps the Fortran code should use a more efficient sort. However, for the sake of code brevity, perhaps the bubble sort is acceptable here. Alternatively, use a better sorting algorithm.\n\nBut given that the code is to be translated, perhaps the sort implementation is not part of the original code's logic, so using any correct sorting method is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps I should note that the bubble sort may not be efficient for large n, but the original code's problem constraints (if any) are unknown.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran's built-in sort functions. Wait, in some Fortran versions, like Fortran 2015, there is the intrinsic 'sort' function. But I'm not sure about the availability. Alternatively, use the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV and other modules.\n\nBut perhaps the code should use an efficient sort. Alternatively, use a quicksort implementation.\n\nBut for the sake of code translation, perhaps the user expects a code that works, regardless of the sorting algorithm.\n\nBut in the code provided, the user wrote:\n\nCollections.sort(ai);\nCollections.sort(bi);\n\nSo the arrays are sorted in ascending order. So as long as the Fortran code sorts the arrays correctly, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the bubble sort in the code above is correct, but for the sake of code correctness, perhaps it's better to use a more efficient algorithm, but given that the code is for translation, perhaps the user just wants a code that works.\n\nSo the code as written would sort the arrays in ascending order.\n\nAnother thing: in the Fortran code, the variables ai and bi are arrays of integers. So the code reads the pairs of integers into them, sorts them, then proceeds.\n\nNow, when n is even, the code uses (ai(n/2) + ai(n/2 +1)) / 2.0d0.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when n is even, for example n=4, n/2 is 2 (since integer division), so n/2 +1 is 3. So for ai(2) and ai(3), which are the two middle elements, correct.\n\nNow, the result when n is even is 2*(c -b) +1. Since c and b are the averages of the two middle elements, their difference is ( (bi_med1 + bi_med2)/2 - (ai_med1 + ai_med2)/2 ) = ( (bi_med1 + bi_med2 - ai_med1 - ai_med2) ) /2. Then multiplied by 2: (bi_med1 + bi_med2 - ai_med1 - ai_med2)/2 *2 = (bi_med1 + bi_med2 - ai_med1 - ai_med2). So the result is that plus 1. So the code can be written as (bi_med1 + bi_med2 - ai_med1 - ai_med2) +1. But in Java, they compute it via the averages, but the code as written in Java is equivalent to that. So perhaps the Fortran code can do the same.\n\nBut in Java's code, when n is even, they compute:\n\ndouble b = (ai.get(ai.size() / 2 -1) + ai.get(ai.size() / 2) + 0.0) / 2;\ndouble c = (bi.get(bi.size() / 2 -1) + bi.get(bi.size() / 2) + 0.0) / 2;\nresult is (int)(2*(c -b) +1).\n\nIn Fortran, when n is even, ai(n/2) is ai_med1 (Java's ai.size()/2 -1 in 0-based), and ai(n/2 +1) is ai_med2 (Java's ai.size()/2 in 0-based). So the code correctly adds those two and divides by 2.\n\nNow, testing for some cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3.\n\nai after sort: [1,2,3], bi after sort: [4,5,6].\n\nmedian_ai = 2, median_bi=5. Result is 5-2 +1=4.\n\nFortran code would compute bi( (3+1)/2 )=bi(2) which is 5, ai( (3+1)/2 )=ai(2)=2. 5-2+1=4.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=2.\n\nai sorted [1,3], bi sorted [2,4].\n\nb = (1+3)/2 =2, c=(2+4)/2=3. 2*(3-2) +1=3. So output is 3.\n\nJava code would do (3-2)*2 +1=3. Correct.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, the Fortran code as written uses double precision for b, c, and result. Then, when printing, it converts to integer with int(result). This should be okay.\n\nBut let's think: when the result is computed as 3.0, int(3.0) is 3. If due to floating point precision, the result is 3.0000000001, then int would give 3. If it's 2.9999999999, then int would give 2. But in Java, casting to int truncates towards zero, so 3.999 becomes 3, and -3.1 becomes -3.\n\nBut in the code's case, when n is even, the result should be an integer. Because the original Java code's formula for even n is:\n\n2*(c - b) +1, where c and b are averages of two integers, leading to possible 0.5 steps. So 2*(c -b) would be an integer. For example, if c-b is 1.5, 2*1.5=3, plus 1 is 4. So the result is integer.\n\nBut if there's any floating point error due to division, perhaps we need to round to the nearest integer. But perhaps the problem ensures that this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, use the nint function to round to the nearest integer. For example:\n\nresult = 2.0d0 * (c - b) + 1.0d0\n\nthen, print nint(result).\n\nBut the Java code uses (int) cast, which truncates, not rounds. So if the calculation is precise, then int(result) and nint(result) would be the same. But if there's a floating point error, perhaps due to division, then using nint is better.\n\nBut let's see: for example, if (ai_med1 + ai_med2) is even, then the average is an integer. If it's odd, then the average is a .5.\n\nFor example, ai_med1=1, ai_med2=3: average 2.0.\n\nai_med1=1, ai_med2=2: average 1.5.\n\nSimilarly for bi.\n\nSo c - b would be ( (bi_med1 + bi_med2)/2 - (ai_med1 + ai_med2)/2 ) = ( (bi_med1 + bi_med2 - ai_med1 - ai_med2) ) / 2.\n\nWhen multiplied by 2, this becomes (bi_med1 + bi_med2 - ai_med1 - ai_med2), which is integer.\n\nAdding 1, the result is integer. So the calculation should be precise. So in Fortran, 2.0d0*(c -b) +1.0d0 should be an integer. Thus, converting to int is safe.\n\nTherefore, using int(result) in Fortran should give the correct result.\n\nSo the code should work as intended.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nBut how to handle the sorting in Fortran. The bubble sort as written will sort the array in ascending order. Let's test:\n\nFor ai = [3,1,2], the bubble sort will sort it to [1,2,3].\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother possible issue: in Fortran, when reading the input, the read statements may have issues if the input lines are not formatted properly. For example, each line has two integers separated by space. The read(*,*) ai(i), bi(i) should handle that.\n\nIn Java's code, they read each line with a StringTokenizer, splitting on whitespace, so the Fortran code's reading is compatible.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should correctly read the input.\n\nNow, translating the code, the main steps are:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Allocate arrays.\n\n- Read pairs into arrays.\n\n- Sort arrays.\n\n- Compute medians based on n's parity.\n\n- Output result.\n\nThus, the code provided earlier should be correct."
