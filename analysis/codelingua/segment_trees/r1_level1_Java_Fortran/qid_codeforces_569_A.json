Then it initializes previous to S and answer to 0. In a loop, while previous is less than T, it increments answer and multiplies previous by q. Finally, it prints the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to handle input in Fortran. In Java, they use Scanner, but Fortran uses READ statements. So I'll read the three integers from standard input. Wait, in Fortran, the variables need to be declared with their types. The Java code uses int for T, S, q, and long for previous. But in Fortran, integers are default integer kind, which might be 32-bit. However, if the multiplication could overflow, maybe we should use a larger type. But since Java's long is 64-bit, perhaps in Fortran, we should use integer(kind=8) for previous. Or maybe the problem constraints are such that integer(kind=4) is enough. The original code uses long for previous to prevent overflow. So in Fortran, we'll use integer(kind=8) for previous. Let's see.\n\nDeclare variables: T, S, q as integers. Previous as integer(kind=8). Answer as integer. Then read T, S, q. Initialize previous to S, answer to 0. Then loop while previous < T. Inside the loop, increment answer, multiply previous by q. Then after loop, print answer.\n\nWait, Fortran's loop constructs are different. Java's while loop is a pre-test loop. So in Fortran, we can use a DO WHILE loop.\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_569_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: T, S, q, answer\n    integer(kind=8) :: previous\n    read(*,*) T, S, q\n    answer = 0\n    previous = S\n    do while (previous < T)\n        answer = answer + 1\n        previous = previous * q\n    end do\n    print *, answer\nend program codeforces_569_A\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the multiplication of previous (integer(8)) by q (integer) would be promoted correctly? Yes, because when you multiply an integer(8) by a default integer, the result is integer(8) as long as the other operand is of higher kind.\n\nSo this should work. Let's test with sample input.\n\nFor example, if input is 5 2 2:\n\nLoop starts with previous=2 <5. Answer becomes 1, previous becomes 4. Then loop again: 4 <5, answer 2, previous 8. Now 8 >=5, loop exits. Output is 2. Wait but the Java code would have:\n\nInitially previous=2 (S=2). answer=0. Check 2 <5 (T=5): yes. answer becomes 1, previous 4. 4<5: yes, answer 2, previous 8. Now 8 >=5, loop ends. Output 2. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: T=10, S=1, q=10. Then loop runs once (1*10=10, answer 1. 10 is not less than 10, loop ends. Output 1. Java code does the same.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be correct. The only thing is to make sure that previous is of a kind that can hold large values. Using integer(8) for previous should suffice."
