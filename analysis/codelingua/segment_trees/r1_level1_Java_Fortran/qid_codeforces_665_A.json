    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads some input values: a, tA, b, tB, and a time string. It calculates the number of buses that overlap with the simulation's time. The simulation departs at a certain time (simDeparture) and arrives after tA minutes. Each bus departs every b minutes starting at 300 minutes (which is 5 AM) until 1440 minutes (24 hours). For each bus, if their departure and arrival times overlap with the simulation's, we count it.\n\nFirst, I'll need to handle input reading in Fortran. Java uses BufferedReader and StringTokenizer, but Fortran reads from standard input with READ statements. The input lines are split into tokens, so I'll have to read them appropriately.\n\nThe time string is in \"HH:MM\" format. In Java, they split it into hours and minutes using substring. In Fortran, I can read the string and parse the first two characters as hours, then characters 4 and 5 as minutes. Wait, the substring(3) in Java starts at index 3, but Java's substring is from startIndex to endIndex-1. Wait, in Java, timing.substring(0,2) gives the first two characters (0 and 1), and timing.substring(3) gives from index 3 to end. So for \"12:34\", that's \"12\" and \"34\". In Fortran, if the string is stored as a variable, we can access parts using string slicing. For example, if the string is time_str, then hours would be time_str(1:2), minutes would be time_str(4:5), assuming the format is correct.\n\nNext, convert the hours and minutes into total minutes. That's straightforward.\n\nThe loop in Java starts at 300 (5 AM in minutes) and increments by b until 1440. For each bus departure time (busDeparture), check if there's an overlap with the simulation's departure and arrival. If the bus departs after the simulation arrives, or the simulation departs after the bus arrives, there's no overlap. Otherwise, increment the counter.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be from i = 300 to 1439 (since 1440 is the end of the day), stepping by b. But in Java, the for loop is i starting at 300, and i < 1440. So in Fortran, the loop should be do i = 300, 1439, b. Wait, but if b is larger than 1440 - 300, then the loop might not run. Also, in Fortran, the loop variable will take the initial value, then increment by step until it exceeds the upper bound. For example, if i starts at 300, steps by b, and stops when i > 1439. But Java's condition is i < 1440. So in Fortran, the upper limit should be 1439. That should be okay.\n\nNow, for each i (busDeparture), compute busArrival as i + tB. Then check if busDeparture >= simArrival (simArrival is simDeparture + tA) or simDeparture >= busArrival. If either is true, skip, else increment counter.\n\nSo the condition for overlap is when there's an intersection between the two intervals [simDeparture, simArrival) and [busDeparture, busArrival). So the Java code checks if the intervals do not overlap by checking if one starts after the other ends. If not, then they overlap.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ncounter = 0\ndo i = 300, 1439, b\n    busDeparture = i\n    busArrival = i + tB\n    if (busDeparture >= simArrival .or. simDeparture >= busArrival) then\n        cycle\n    else\n        counter = counter + 1\n    endif\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is i < 1440. So for example, if i starts at 300 and steps by b, and the next i would be 300 + b, etc., but must be less than 1440. So in Fortran, the loop do i = 300, 1439, b would include all i's such that i <= 1439. So if i steps by b and the next step would exceed 1439, it's not included. That's correct.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nThe Java code reads two lines. The first line has a and tA, the second has b and tB. Then the third line is the timing string.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read each line as a whole. But in Fortran, reading from standard input can be done with read(*,*) to get the tokens. So for the first line, read a and tA. Then the second line read b and tB. The third line is the timing string.\n\nBut in Java, the code uses StringTokenizer to split each line. So in Fortran, the read statements can directly read the integers from the lines. Let's see:\n\nFirst line: two integers. So read(*,*) a, tA.\n\nSecond line: two integers. read(*,*) b, tB.\n\nThird line: the time string. So read as a character variable. Then parse the hours and minutes.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=5) :: time_str\nread(*,*) time_str\n\nThen, hours_str = time_str(1:2)\nminutes_str = time_str(4:5)\n\nBut need to convert these strings to integers. So in Fortran, read them as internal files.\n\nread(time_str(1:2), '(I2)') hrs\nread(time_str(4:5), '(I2)') mins\n\nThen simDeparture = hrs*60 + mins\n\nsimArrival = simDeparture + tA\n\nNow, the loop.\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop variable must be an integer. The variables a, b, tA, tB are read as integers. So when stepping in the loop, the step is 'b', which is the variable read from input.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop is from i=300; i <1440; i +=b. So in Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo i = 300, 1439, b\n    ... \nend do\n\nBut what if b is zero? Well, in Java code, the input is from the user, so 'b' is a positive integer. So in Fortran, assuming the input is correct, the loop is okay.\n\nNow, counting the overlaps. For each bus, check if the intervals overlap.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo the Fortran code would be structured as:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: a, tA, b, tB, hrs, mins, simDeparture, simArrival, counter, i, busDeparture, busArrival\n    character(len=5) :: time_str\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) a, tA\n    read(*,*) b, tB\n    read(*,*) time_str\n\n    ! Parse time_str into hrs and mins\n    read(time_str(1:2), '(I2)') hrs\n    read(time_str(4:5), '(I2)') mins\n\n    simDeparture = hrs * 60 + mins\n    simArrival = simDeparture + tA\n\n    counter = 0\n\n    do i = 300, 1439, b\n        busDeparture = i\n        busArrival = i + tB\n\n        if (busDeparture >= simArrival .or. simDeparture >= busArrival) then\n            cycle\n        else\n            counter = counter + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, counter\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop starts at 300 and increments by b each time. So in Fortran, the step is 'b', which is the variable read from input. But in the Java code, 'b' is the interval for buses, but the variables are named in the Java code as 'b' and 'tB'. Wait, in the Java code, the first line after the first token is 'a' and 'tA', then the next line is 'b' and 'tB'. So the step in the loop is the 'b' variable. So in Fortran, the loop step is 'b'.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 300; i < 1440; i += b) {\n\nSo yes, step is 'b' as read from input.\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop variable 'i' is being assigned to busDeparture. Then busArrival is i + tB.\n\nBut what about if the bus's arrival time is after midnight (i.e., >=1440)? The Java code doesn't check that. Because even if the bus departs at 1439 (23:59), and takes tB minutes, which could make the arrival time into the next day, but the condition is only about overlapping with the simulation's interval, which is also within the same day (since the simulation's departure is based on the input time, which is up to 23:59).\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle that correctly.\n\nNow, possible edge cases. For example, when the simulation starts at 23:59, which is 23*60 +59 = 1439 minutes. Adding tA would take it to 1439 + tA. But since the buses run until 1439 (i <1440), their arrival could be beyond 1440.\n\nBut the logic in Java's code is okay. For example, if a bus departs at 1439, arrives at 1439 + tB. The simulation's interval is [simDeparture, simArrival). If that overlaps with the bus's interval, it's counted.\n\nSo the Fortran code is correct.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the buses start at 300 (5 AM), and run every b minutes. So in Fortran, the loop starts at 300, steps by b. So that's correct.\n\nTesting: Let's say input is:\n\na and tA: let's say 0 60 (but a is not used in the code, so perhaps the Java code's variables are a and b but the code uses 'b' for the bus interval. Wait, looking at the Java code:\n\nYes, the variables a and tA are read but not used in the code. Because in the Java code:\n\nint a = ... but then in the loop, the step is 'b', which comes from the next line. So perhaps the variables a and tA are unused. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nYes, the code reads a and tA, but the loop uses 'b' as the step. The variables a and tA are part of the input but not used. That's a problem. Wait, no: the code reads a and tA, but in the problem statement, perhaps the code is part of a problem where those variables are used, but in the given code, they are not used. For example, looking at the code:\n\nThe code calculates simDeparture and simArrival as the time interval for the simulation. The loop is for buses departing every 'b' minutes starting at 5 AM, with each taking tB minutes. The code counts how many buses' intervals overlap with the simulation's interval.\n\nBut the code uses 'a' and 'tA' variables but does not use them. Wait, looking again:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nint a = ...; int tA = ...;\n\nsimDeparture is based on the input time, then simArrival = simDeparture + tA.\n\nAh! So tA is the time taken for the simulation's journey. So that is used. But 'a' is not used in the code. So that's a mistake? Or perhaps in the original problem, 'a' and 'b' are other parameters. But in the code provided, 'a' is read but not used. But for the code translation, we have to follow exactly, even if it's a mistake.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, variables a and b are read, but 'a' is not used. So the code should read them but not use.\n\nSo the Fortran code will read a and tA, then b and tB.\n\nIn the code, the variables a and tA are read, but a is not used. So in Fortran, the code will have variables a, tA, b, tB, etc., but a is not used. That's okay.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, variables a and tA are read, but a is not used. So the code will have:\n\nread(*,*) a, tA\n\nBut a is not used elsewhere.\n\nSo the code is as written before.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, the loop starts at 300. So 5 AM. So in Fortran, same.\n\nTesting sample input. Let's take the sample input from codeforces problem 665A, but perhaps the code's approach may differ.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be correct.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when reading from input using list-directed input (read(*,*)), leading blanks are ignored, and commas can separate values. But in the Java code, the input is read via StringTokenizer, which splits on whitespace. So if the input lines have multiple spaces, it's the same.\n\nSo the code should read the variables correctly.\n\nParsing the time string: For example, \"09:45\" would be split into 09 and 45. But in Fortran, reading the first two characters as '09' is okay. The read statement with '(I2)' will parse it as 9 or 09 as 9? No, in Fortran, leading zeros in integer reads are allowed. So '09' will be read as 9. Wait, no: for example, if you read '09' with I2 format, the integer value is 9. So that's correct.\n\nSo the parsing of the time string should work.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In the loop step, if 'b' is 0, but in the problem, probably b is a positive integer. But the code doesn't check for that. But the original Java code also doesn't check.\n\nSo assuming the input is correct, the code will work.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, the loop variable can't be modified inside the loop, but in this code, it's not being modified, so that's okay.\n\nSo the Fortran code should correctly mirror the Java code."
