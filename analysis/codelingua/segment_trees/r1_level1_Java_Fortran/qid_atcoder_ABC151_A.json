    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let's start by looking at the main part of the Java code. The main class is atcoder_ABC151_A, which reads a character from the input and prints the next character. The RemRing class seems to handle modular arithmetic operations, but since the main program doesn't use it, maybe I don't need to translate that part. Wait, the user probably wants the main program translated. Let me check the main method again.\n\nThe Java code uses BufferedReader to read a line from standard input. Then it takes the first character of the string, adds 1 to it, and prints the resulting character. For example, if input is 'a', output is 'b'.\n\nIn Fortran, reading input can be done with READ statements. Characters in Fortran are handled using strings. So the steps would be: read a string, get the first character, increment its ASCII value by 1, convert back to a character, and print it.\n\nWait, in Java, s.charAt(0) gives the first character of the string. Adding 1 to a char in Java promotes it to an int, so 'a' becomes 97, adding 1 gives 98, which is 'b' when cast back to char.\n\nIn Fortran, characters can be manipulated using their ASCII values via the IACHAR and ACHAR functions. So, for the input string, take the first character, get its ASCII code, add 1, then convert back to a character.\n\nSo the Fortran code would look something like this:\n\nRead the input line into a variable. Then, extract the first character. Compute the next character. Then write it out.\n\nNow, in Fortran, when reading with READ(*, '(A)'), the variable needs to be a character variable of sufficient length. Let's say we read into a variable of length 1, but maybe the input could have more characters. Wait, but the Java code reads the entire line but takes only the first character. So in Fortran, reading a single character would suffice, but perhaps the input might have more. So maybe read the entire line, then take the first character.\n\nWait, in Java, s = r.readLine() reads the entire line. Then s.charAt(0) takes the first character. So in Fortran, we can read the entire line into a string variable, then take the first character.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Read the input line into a string variable.\n- Take the first character.\n- Compute the next character (current ASCII +1).\n- Output it.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100) :: input_line\n    character :: c\n    integer :: i\n\n    read(*, '(a)') input_line\n    c = input_line(1:1)\n    i = iachar(c)\n    i = i + 1\n    c = achar(i)\n    print *, c\nend program main\n\nBut in Fortran, when you use print *, it adds a space before the output. The Java code uses printf(\"%c\", ...) which prints the character without any space. So to avoid leading space, perhaps use write(*, '(a)') instead of print *.\n\nSo the output line should be:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)') c\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100) :: s\n    character :: c\n\n    read(*, '(a)') s\n    c = s(1:1)\n    c = achar(iachar(c) + 1)\n    write(*, '(a)') c\nend program main\n\nI think that should work. The Java code also includes the RemRing class, but since the main program doesn't use it, perhaps it's not necessary to translate that part. The user's instruction was to translate the given Java code, but perhaps the RemRing is part of the code but unused here. However, the user's example input only includes the main method's code. The answer should focus on the main part. The assistant should probably mention that the RemRing class is not translated since it's unused, or perhaps include it if needed.\n\nBut given that the user provided the Java code including RemRing but the main method doesn't use it, perhaps the user wants the entire code translated. Wait, the Java code has two classes: atcoder_ABC151_A and RemRing. The main method is in the first class. The RemRing is a helper class, but not used in the main program. So the user probably only needs the main part translated. The assistant can note that the RemRing class is not included as it's unused. But perhaps the user included it by mistake. So the translated Fortran code should focus on the main method.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the Fortran code that reads a character, increments it, and prints it. The RemRing class can be omitted unless the user specifies otherwise. Since the original problem only asks to translate the Java code provided, and the main part uses the first character, the rest is not needed."
