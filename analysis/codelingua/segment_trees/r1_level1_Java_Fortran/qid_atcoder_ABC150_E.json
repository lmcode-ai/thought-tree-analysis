    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first. The main steps are:\n\n1. Read input values.\n2. Sort the array c.\n3. Compute some powers using a custom power function.\n4. Calculate the answer through a loop.\n\nFirst, handling input. In Java, they read two lines. The first line is n, and the second line has n integers for array c. In Fortran, I'll need to read from standard input. So I'll read the first line as the integer n, then read the next line's n integers into an array.\n\nWait, Fortran uses fixed-size arrays, but here n is variable. So I'll first read n, then allocate the array c with size n. But in Fortran, I need to declare the array as allocatable and then allocate it once I know n. So the steps would be:\n\n- Read n from input.\n- Allocate c(n).\n- Read the next line's n integers into c.\n\nNext, the Java code sorts the array c in ascending order using Arrays.parallelSort. In Fortran, I can use the intrinsic sort function. But wait, Fortran's sort might not be directly available. Oh, right, in Fortran, you can sort an array using the sort function, but the exact method depends on the compiler. Alternatively, I can sort using the sort intrinsic, assuming that the compiler supports it. For example, call sort(c) would sort the array in ascending order. Wait, but in Java, they sort in ascending order, and in the loop, they access c[n+1 -i]. Let me check: the original Java code sorts c in ascending order. Then, in the loop, for i from 2 to n+1, the code uses c[n+1 -i]. Let's see: when i=2, n+1 -i =n-1. Wait, in Java, arrays are 0-based. So after sorting, c is in ascending order. Then, for i in 2..n+1 (which is n terms?), wait the loop in Java is written as for (int i = 2; i <= n + 1; i++). Wait, that loop runs from i=2 up to i =n+1. So the number of iterations is (n+1 -2) +1 = n. But the array has length n. Hmm, for i starting at 2, and up to n+1. Let's see: n+1 -i is n+1 -2 =n-1 (for first iteration). Then for i =n+1, n+1 -i =0. So the indices used are from 0 to n-1. Wait, the array is sorted in ascending order, and then the loop is accessing elements from the end. For example, if n=3, i runs from 2 to 4. Then for i=2: index 3+1 -2=2 (since n=3, 3+1-2=2? Wait, Java code has c[n+1 -i]. Wait, original code's n is the length of the array. So for i from 2 to n+1, inclusive. Let's take n=3. Then i runs 2,3,4. Then for each i: c[n+1 -i] = c[3+1 -i] = c[4 -i]. When i=2: 4-2=2 \u2192 index 2 (third element in Java's 0-based array). When i=3: 4-3=1 \u2192 index 1. i=4:4-4=0 \u2192 index 0. So for n=3, the elements accessed are c[2], c[1], c[0]. So the array is sorted in ascending order, and then accessed in reverse order. So in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based by default, after sorting in ascending order, we need to reverse the array so that the first element is the largest. Wait, no. Wait, Java's code after sorting c in ascending order (smallest first), then accessing from the largest to the smallest. Because in the loop, the index is n+1 -i. For example, if the array is [a, b, c] sorted ascending (a <= b <= c), then the code accesses c[2], c[1], c[0], which are the elements in reverse order. So in Fortran, if we sort the array in ascending order and then reverse it, then accessing from 1 to n would get the same elements. So in Fortran, after sorting, I need to reverse the array. Or, perhaps, sort in descending order. Alternatively, during the loop, access the array from the end. Let me think.\n\nIn Fortran, after sorting, the array is in ascending order. So to get the elements in reverse order (descending), perhaps I can reverse the array. So in Fortran code:\n\ncall sort(c)  ! sorts in ascending order\nc = c(n:1:-1)  ! reverses the array\n\nWait, but Fortran's sort function may not be standard. Oh right, the standard does not have a built-in sort function, but many compilers provide it as an extension. Alternatively, I can use the quicksort algorithm. But for the sake of code translation, perhaps assume that the array is sorted in ascending order and then reversed. So that the first element is the largest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran, we can sort the array in descending order. Let me check. The sort function may take a compare function. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, after sorting in ascending order, reverse the array.\n\nSo in the Java code, after sorting, the elements are accessed in reverse order (from largest to smallest). So for Fortran, after sorting in ascending order, reverse the array so that c(1) is the largest element, c(2) next largest, etc. Then, during the loop, when i runs from 2 to n+1 (wait, no: in Java, the loop runs for i from 2 to n+1, which is a total of (n+1 -2 +1) =n steps. So the number of elements is n. So in Fortran, perhaps the loop runs from i=1 to n. Wait, in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n+1; i++) {\n    val = a * i % mod;\n    val *= c[n+1 -i];\n    ...\n}\n\nSo when i ranges from 2 to n+1, n+1 -i ranges from (n+1 -2) =n-1 to 0. So for n elements. So in Fortran, after reversing the array, the elements are in descending order. Then, for each index j from 1 to n, the code would multiply by c(j). So in Fortran, perhaps the loop runs from j=1 to n, and in each iteration, the current i in Java's code is (j+1), because:\n\nJava's i ranges from 2 to n+1. So j can be from 1 to n, where j = i-1. Then, in Java:\n\nc[n+1 -i] = c[n+1 - (j+1)] = c[n - j]\n\nWait, let's see: i = j + 1. So when j ranges from 1 to n, i ranges from 2 to n+1. Then, in Java, the index is n+1 -i = n+1 - (j+1) = n -j. But since in Fortran, the array was sorted ascending and then reversed, the elements are in descending order. So in Fortran, the array is sorted in ascending, then reversed. So the original array in Java after sorting is [c0, c1, ..., cn-1] (0-based), ascending. Then reversed gives [cn-1, cn-2, ..., c0]. Then in Fortran, the array is c(1) = cn-1, c(2)=cn-2, etc. So when Java accesses c[n+1 -i], which is c[n -j], where j is from 1 to n. For j=1, n-j =n-1 (Java index, which is c[n-1], which is the last element of the Java array. But in Fortran's reversed array, that's c(1). Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should sort the array in ascending order, then reverse it, so that in Fortran, the array is in descending order. Then, in the loop, for each j from 1 to n, the element is c(j). Because in Java, after sorting, the array is [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}] in ascending order. Then, the code uses a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, ..., a_0. So in Fortran, after reversing, the array is [a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, ..., a_0]. So each element in the Java code's c[n+1 -i] is a_{n+1 -i -1} (because Java's array is 0-based). So for i from 2 to n+1, n+1 -i ranges from n-1 to 0, so a_{n+1 -i -1} = a_{n -i}. So perhaps in Fortran, after sorting and reversing, the j-th element (j starts at 1) is a_{n- j} ?\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to process the array in Fortran as follows:\n\nSort the array in ascending order (same as Java), then reverse it to get descending order.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ncall sort(c)  ! ascending\nc = c(n:1:-1)  ! reverse to get descending\n\nThen, in the loop, for each j in 1..n, c(j) is the j-th largest element, which corresponds to Java's c[n+1 -i], where i is from 2 to n+1, but j would be from 1 to n.\n\nWait, perhaps in the Java loop, the code accesses the array in reverse order. So for each iteration, the index is (n+1 -i), which in Java's 0-based array gives elements from the end. So for example, n elements, sorted ascendingly. Then, the code uses the elements in reverse order. So for i=2: index is n+1 -2 =n-1. Which is the last element. For i=3: n+1-3 =n-2, etc. So in Fortran, if the array is sorted ascending and then reversed, then the first element is the largest, which is the same as the last element in Java's array. So when j runs from 1 to n in Fortran, c(j) is the same as Java's c[n - j], but since Java's array is 0-based, and Fortran's is 1-based. Wait, perhaps not. Let's take an example. Suppose n=3. Java's array after sorting is [1,2,3] (ascending). Then reversed would be [3,2,1]. In Java's loop, for i=2,3,4 (since n+1 is 4 when n=3). So for i=2: index 3+1-2=2 \u2192 element 3 (array[2] is third element in Java 0-based). For i=3: 3+1-3=1 \u2192 element 2. For i=4: 0 \u2192 element 1. So Java uses elements 3,2,1. In Fortran, after sorting and reversing, the array is [3,2,1]. So j=1 \u21923, j=2\u21922, j=3\u21921. So the same elements. So in the Fortran loop, for each j from 1 to n, multiply by c(j). So the loop in Fortran would be from j=1 to n, and the term would be a * (j+1) * c(j). Wait, because in Java, the loop uses i which starts from 2. So when j is 1 in Fortran, i is j+1=2. Then, the code uses i as (j+1). So the term a * i mod mod, where i is (j+1). So the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo j = 1, n\n    i = j + 1\n    val = a * i mod mod_val\n    val = val * c(j) mod mod_val\n    ans = mod(ans + val, mod_val)\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct. Because for each j in 1..n, i is j+1, which in Java's loop runs from 2 to n+1.\n\nSo that's the loop part.\n\nNow, the power function. The Java code uses a custom power function that computes x^n mod mod_val using exponentiation by squaring. In Fortran, I'll need to write a recursive or iterative function for this. Let's see. Since the Java code is recursive, but Fortran may not handle recursion well for very large exponents (stack overflow?), but given that in the problem, n can be up to whatever (but the original code uses n up to 1e5?), but in any case, the code seems to call power(2, n) and power(2, n-2). So for exponents up to 1e5, which can be handled iteratively.\n\nSo writing an iterative power function would be better. Let's reimplement the Java power function in Fortran. The Java function is:\n\nstatic long power(long x, long n) {\n    if (n ==0) return 1;\n    mod = 1e9+7;\n    val = power(x, n/2);\n    val = val * val % mod;\n    if (n%2 ==1) val = val * x % mod;\n    return val;\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, we can implement this as a recursive function, but recursion in Fortran can be a bit tricky. Alternatively, an iterative approach.\n\nBut for Fortran, let's write a function that computes x**n mod mod_val using exponentiation by squaring. Let's write it as a module function or an internal function.\n\nIn Fortran, functions can be written inside the main program using contains. So here's a possible structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, mod_val\n    integer, allocatable :: c(:)\n    integer(8) :: a, b, ans, val\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(c(n))\n    read(*,*) c\n    mod_val = 1000000007\n    !

Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort. So how to sort the array?\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because in the Java code, the array is sorted, which is crucial for the algorithm. So in Fortran, I need to implement a sort. But writing a quick sort or using a library function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use a simple sort. Let's implement a quick sort in Fortran.\n\nSo adding a quicksort subroutine.\n\nBut for the sake of time, perhaps use a simple bubble sort. But that's not efficient. However, since the code is a translation, perhaps the user expects a correct translation, and the efficiency of the sort is not the main concern here.\n\nAlternatively, the code can use the Fortran intrinsic function sort, but that's not standard. Wait, some compilers support the sort function, but it's not standard. For example, the GNU Fortran compiler has a sort function in the 'fsort' module or similar. But to write a portable code, it's better to implement the sorting.\n\nSo I need to implement a sorting routine for the array.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic 'sort' function if available. But since that's not standard, perhaps the code will have to implement a quick sort.\n\nSo let's proceed to implement a quick sort in Fortran for the array.\n\nBut how? Let's think. The array is integer. So here's a possible quick sort implementation.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function from the 'iso_fortran_env' module. Wait, no, that's not part of the standard. So perhaps the code should include a quick sort subroutine.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of a quick sort for an integer array.\n\nsubroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n    integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n    if (low < high) then\n        pivot = arr((low + high)/2)\n        i = low -1\n        j = high +1\n        do\n            do\n                i = i +1\n                if (arr(i) >= pivot) exit\n            end do\n            do\n                j = j -1\n                if (arr(j) <= pivot) exit\n            end do\n            if (i >= j) exit\n            ! swap\n            temp = arr(i)\n            arr(i) = arr(j)\n            arr(j) = temp\n        end do\n        call quicksort(arr, low, j)\n        call quicksort(arr, j+1, high)\n    end if\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nBut this is a recursive implementation, which may have stack issues for large arrays. Alternatively, use an iterative approach.\n\nBut perhaps for the sake of this code translation, using a simple quick sort as a recursive subroutine.\n\nSo in the Fortran code:\n\nAfter reading the array c, call quicksort(c, 1, n), which sorts the array in ascending order. Then reverse the array to get descending order.\n\nWait, no. The quicksort subroutine written above sorts the array in ascending order. Because the first loop increments i until arr[i] >= pivot (so elements to the left are less than pivot). The second loop decrements j until arr[j] <= pivot. Then swap. So the pivot is placed such that elements to the left are <= pivot and elements to the right are >= pivot. Then recursively sort the two parts.\n\nWait, this implementation may sort in ascending order. Let me test with a simple example. Suppose the array is [3,1,2]. The pivot is arr(2) =1. Then i starts at 0, increments to 0 (arr[0] is 3 >=1?), no. Wait, the code is written in Fortran, where array indices start at 1. Wait, the low and high are passed as 1 and n. So for the array [3,1,2], low=1, high=3. pivot is arr(2) =1. Then i starts at low-1=0. Then enter the first loop: i increments to 1. arr[1] is 3 >=1 \u2192 exit. Then j starts at high+1=4. Decrement j to 3: arr[3] is 2 <=1? No. Then j=2: arr[2]=1 <=1 \u2192 exit. Now i=1, j=2. Since i <j, swap. The array becomes [1,3,2]. Then call quicksort on low=1, j=2. Then call quicksort on j+1=3, high=3. So the first call is to sort [1,3], low=1, high=2. Pivot is arr(1.5) \u2192 arr(1) =1? Then i starts at 0, j starts at3. i increments to 1: arr[1] >=1 \u2192 yes. j decrements to 2: arr[2] =3 <=1? No. Then j=1. Now i=1 >=j=1 \u2192 exit. So the partition is j=1. Then call quicksort(1,1) and (2,2). So the array becomes [1,3,2]. Then the second call is to sort from 3 to3. So the array is [1,3,2]. Then after that, the original array was [3,1,2], sorted into [1,3,2]. Then reversed to [2,3,1]. Hmm, perhaps this quicksort implementation is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is not the right approach, and the code should use a different sorting method. Maybe a bubble sort for simplicity, but that's inefficient. However, for the code translation, perhaps the code can use the quicksort as written, but adjusted for Fortran's 1-based indexing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Fortran intrinsic function, but that's not standard. So the code would have to include a sorting subroutine.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, after sorting, the array is in ascending order. Then reversed.\n\nBut perhaps the code can use the quicksort subroutine as written. But how to handle the array indices.\n\nAlternatively, use the sort from the Fortran standard library. But since that's not available, I think the code should include a sorting implementation.\n\nBut this complicates the translation. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the code is for programming competition, perhaps the user expects that the array is sorted in ascending order and then reversed, so the code uses the built-in sort if available. Otherwise, the code may not work. But how to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran code, use the quicksort as follows:\n\nAfter allocating and reading the array, call the quicksort subroutine to sort the array in ascending order, then reverse it.\n\nSo the code would have:\n\ncall quicksort(c, 1, n)\nc = c(n:1:-1)\n\nBut wait, the quicksort subroutine as written may not work. Let me test the code.\n\nAlternatively, use the code from Rosetta Stone's quicksort implementation for Fortran.\n\nLooking it up, here's a possible implementation from Rosetta Stone:\n\nrecursive subroutine quicksort(a, first, last)\n  implicit none\n  integer*4  a(*), x, t\n  integer first, last\n  integer i, j\n\n  x = a( (first+last) / 2 )\n  i = first\n  j = last\n  do\n     do while (a(i) < x)\n        i=i+1\n     end do\n     do while (x < a(j))\n        j=j-1\n     end do\n     if (i >= j) exit\n     t = a(i);  a(i) = a(j);  a(j) = t\n     i=i+1\n     j=j-1\n  end do\n  if (first < i-1) call quicksort(a, first, i-1)\n  if (j+1 < last)  call quicksort(a, j+1, last)\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nThis implementation sorts the array in ascending order.\n\nSo using this code, after calling quicksort(c, 1, n), the array is sorted in ascending order. Then reverse it with c = c(n:1:-1).\n\nSo in the Fortran code:\n\ncall quicksort(c, 1, n)\nc = c(n:1:-1)\n\nYes.\n\nSo integrating this into the code.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, mod_val, i, j\n    integer, allocatable :: c(:)\n    integer(8) :: a, b, ans, val\n    !

Does that work? Because when passing an allocatable array to a subroutine that expects a(*), the actual argument must be contiguous. But in Fortran, allocatable arrays are contiguous. So this should be okay.\n\nAlso, in the power function, the parameters x and n are 8-byte integers. When passing 2_8 and n (which is integer, so converted to 8-byte via int(n,8)), this is okay.\n\nIn the main program, the variables a and b are computed as power(2_8, n, mod_val). For example, when n is read as an integer, and passed as int(n,8), which converts it to 8-byte integer.\n\nAlso, note that in the initial case when n is 1, the code prints mod(c(1)*2, mod_val). Because in Fortran, after sorting and reversing, the array is [c(1)] (since n=1), so c(1) is the same as the original element. But wait, when n=1, after sorting and reversing, the code reads the original array. Because when you read a single element, then call quicksort (which does nothing) and reverse, which leaves the array as is. So it's correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with sample inputs.\n\nFor example, in the Java code, if n=1, the output is (c[0] * 2) mod 1e9+7. Which is handled in the Fortran code.\n\nAnother test case: let's say n=2, c = [1,2]. After sorting in Java, it becomes [1,2]. Then reversed in Fortran becomes [2,1]. Then the loop runs for j=1 to 2. i = j+1.\n\nFor j=1: i=2. val = a * 2 mod mod_val. a is power(2, n-2) = power(2,0) =1. So val =1 *2 =2. multiplied by c(1)=2. \u2192 4. ans=4.\n\nj=2: i=3. val=1*3=3 multiplied by c(2)=1 \u21923. ans=4+3=7.\n\nThen multiply by b=power(2,2)=4. 7 *4=28 mod 1e9+7 \u219228.\n\nSo the output would be 28.\n\nBut what's the expected output for this case? Let's see.\n\nIn the Java code, the loop runs for i=2 to n+1=3.\n\nFor i=2: c[n+1 -i] = c[3-2] = c[1] (Java's array is 0-based) which is 2. a is 1. val=1*2 *2=4.\n\nFor i=3: c[3+1-3=1] \u2192c[1] =2. val=1*3 *1=3. Wait, wait. Wait, original c after sorting in Java is [1,2]. Then reversed in Fortran is [2,1]. So in Java code:\n\nn=2. Then for i=2, c[n+1 -i] = c[3-2=1] \u2192 which is c[1] in Java's array (0-based) \u2192 value 2.\n\nBut in the loop, for i=2 and 3:\n\ni=2: c[3-2=1] \u21922 \u2192 val = a *2 *2 \u21921*2*2=4.\n\ni=3: c[3-3=0] \u2192c[0] =1 \u2192 val=1*3 *1=3. Sum is 4+3=7.\n\nMultiply by b=2^2=4 \u219228.\n\nWhich matches the Fortran code's result. So yes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, a is power(2, n-2) = power(2, 0) =1. So yes.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran uses integer division. So when computing exponents, the power function correctly uses exponentiation by squaring. The power function is implemented iteratively, which should handle large exponents.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nThe final code includes the quicksort and power functions, handles the input, reverses the array after sorting, and computes the result as per the Java code."
