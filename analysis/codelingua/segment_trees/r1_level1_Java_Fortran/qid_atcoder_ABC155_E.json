    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does.\n\nThe Java program reads a number as a string, processes each digit from right to left (reverse order), and calculates the minimum number of bills needed based on certain conditions. The digits array is one-based longer than the input string. Then, for each digit, it checks if it's 10 (which might be due to a carryover from the previous digit), handles cases where the digit is less than 5, equal to 5, or greater than 5. It accumulates the number of bills accordingly and handles carryovers to the next digit.\n\nFirst, let's think about the input. The Java code uses a scanner to read the input string. In Fortran, we'll read the input as a character string.\n\nNext, the digits array in Java has a length of number.length() + 1. The digits are stored in reverse order. So for the input string, each character is converted to an integer and stored in reverse. For example, if the input is \"123\", the digits array would be [3,2,1,0] (with an extra position at the end, maybe for the carryover?).\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So maybe we can adjust the indices accordingly. Let's see. The Java code's digits array is 0-based. The loop runs from i=0 to i=number.length(). So in Fortran, maybe we can have the digits array start at 1, and loop from i=1 to i = len(number) +1? Or adjust the indices properly.\n\nWait, the Java code's digits array has length number.length()+1. For example, if the input is 3 digits, digits has 4 elements. The loop in Java runs for i from 0 to number.length() (inclusive?), but the for loop is \"for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++)\". Wait, no, the initial loop is for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) which fills digits[i] from 0 to len-1. Then the processing loop is for i from 0 to len (inclusive?), since the digits array has len+1 elements. Wait, the first loop initializes digits[i] for i < number.length(), and then the processing loop runs for i from 0 to len (since digits has len+1 elements, indices 0 to len).\n\nWait, the digits array is of length number.length() + 1. So indexes 0 to len (since len is the original length). So when processing, for each i in 0 to len (inclusive?), but the loop in Java is written as:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) { ... }\n\nWait, no. The original code's loop is written as:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) { ... }\n\nWait, number.length() is the length of the input string. The digits array is of length number.length() +1, so indexes 0 to number.length(). So when i is equal to number.length(), digits[i] is valid. So the loop runs from i=0 to i = number.length(), which is the same as the length of the digits array minus 1. So in Fortran, perhaps the digits array will have indices from 1 to len+1, and the loop runs from 1 to len+1.\n\nBut first, let's think about how to reverse the digits. In Java, digits[i] is filled as number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0'. So the first digit (i=0) is the last character of the string, i=1 is the second last, etc. So in Fortran, for a string of length N, the digits array (after reversal) will have digits(1) = the last character of the input string, digits(2) the second last, etc. Then the digits array in Fortran will be of size len+1, with digits(1:len) being the reversed digits, and digits(len+1) being 0 initially (since the Java code initializes all elements, but in Java the array is initialized to zeroes. Wait, in Java, the digits array is new int[number.length() +1], so all elements are initialized to 0. Then, the first loop fills from 0 to len-1 (assuming len is the original string length). Then the processing loop runs from i=0 to len (so len+1 elements in total, but indices 0 to len). Hmm.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the input is \"123\", which has length 3. The digits array is of length 4 (indices 0,1,2,3). The first loop runs i from 0 to 2 (since i <3). So digits[0] is '3' (the last character), digits[1] is '2', digits[2] is '1', and digits[3] remains 0. Then the processing loop runs i from 0 to 3 (inclusive?), since i <=3. So i can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo in Fortran, the input string's length is N. Then the digits array needs to be size N+1, with the first N elements being the reversed digits, and the last element (N+1) being 0. Wait, no. Because in Java, digits is length N+1. So indices 0 to N. For N=3, digits[3] exists and is 0. Then during processing, the loop runs from i=0 to N (i=3 in this case). So in Fortran, the digits array can be dimension (0:N) perhaps. But Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but you can define them with arbitrary lower bounds.\n\nAlternatively, make the Fortran digits array start at index 1. So for the input string of length N, the digits array is of size N+1. The first N elements (1 to N) are the reversed digits, and the N+1-th element is 0.\n\nWait, in Java, digits[0] is the first digit (the last character of the input). digits[1] is the next, etc. Then in the processing loop, when i=0, we process digits[0], which is the first reversed digit, and when i reaches N, digits[N] is the last element (originally 0, possibly modified during processing).\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps the digits array is of size (0:max_digits), but handling that might be tricky. Alternatively, shift the indices by 1.\n\nAlternatively, let's adjust the indices. In Fortran, make the digits array start at 0. But Fortran allows that if we declare it as digits(0:len), where len is the original string length. But in Fortran, when you declare an array as (0:len), it has len+1 elements (0 to len). So for example, for an input length of 3, the digits array would have 4 elements (0,1,2,3). That's possible.\n\nBut Fortran's default array indexing starts at 1, but you can change it. Let me think: perhaps the easiest way is to adjust the indices. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input string. In Fortran, we can read a character variable.\n\nThen, reverse the string's digits. For example, input '123' becomes digits (in Java) [3,2,1,0]. So in Fortran, the digits array should have elements (0:3) (for input length 3). So digits(0) =3, digits(1)=2, digits(2)=1, digits(3)=0.\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps we can loop over the input string in reverse order and assign the digits. So for i from 1 to len, digits(i-1) = the ith character from the end. Wait, for input '123', len is 3. The first character (index 1 in Fortran) is '1', index 2 is '2', index 3 is '3'. So reversed, the digits would be 3,2,1. So in Java, digits[0] is 3, digits[1] is 2, digits[2] is 1. Then digits[3] is 0 (the extra element).\n\nSo in Fortran, the digits array can be of size (0:len), where len is the length of the input string. Then digits(0:len-1) are the reversed digits, and digits(len) is 0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Java, the digits array has length len+1, where len is the input length. So for len=3, the array has 4 elements (0-3). The first loop fills digits[0], digits[1], digits[2], and digits[3] is 0. Then during processing, i ranges up to 3.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps declare the digits array as (0:len), where len is the input length. So for input length N, digits(0:N). Then the first N elements (0 to N-1) are the reversed digits, digits(N) is 0.\n\nBut Fortran's array syntax can handle this. So the code steps would be:\n\n1. Read the input string.\n\n2. Determine its length.\n\n3. Allocate the digits array from 0 to len (so len+1 elements).\n\n4. Initialize digits(0:len-1) to the reversed digits of the input, digits(len) to 0.\n\nThen process each digit from 0 to len.\n\nIn Fortran, to loop from 0 to len, inclusive. But in Fortran, do loops can have start and end values.\n\nNow, the processing:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n        digits[i + 1]++;\n        digits[i] = 0;\n    }\n    if (digits[i] <5) {\n        bills += digits[i];\n    } else if (digits[i] ==5) {\n        if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n            digits[i+1]++;\n        }\n        bills +=5;\n    } else {\n        digits[i+1]++;\n        bills +=10 - digits[i];\n    }\n}\n\nBut in this loop, when i is number.length(), i+1 would be number.length()+1, which is beyond the digits array's original length. Wait, but in Java, digits has length number.length() +1. So for i = number.length(), digits[i] is the last element (index number.length()), and digits[i+1] is index number.length() +1, which is out of bounds. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn Java, the digits array is new int[number.length() +1], so the maximum index is number.length(). So when i is number.length(), then i+1 is number.length() +1, which is out of bounds. But in the Java code, when i loops up to number.length(), which is the digits array's length -1 (since the array is of size number.length() +1, indices 0 to number.length()). So for i in 0 to number.length().\n\nWait, for example, if the original input is length 3. The digits array is of size 4 (indices 0,1,2,3). The loop runs i from 0 to 3. Then when i=3, i+1 is 4, which is out of the array's bounds (max index 3). So this would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. But in the original code, does that happen?\n\nWait, looking at the code again. The original code:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC155_E {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        final long INF = (long) 1e15;\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        String number = sc.next();\n        int[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n        for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n            digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n        }\n        int bills = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                digits[i + 1]++;\n                digits[i] = 0;\n            }\n            if (digits[i] <5) {\n                bills += digits[i];\n            } else if (digits[i] ==5) {\n                if (digits[i +1] >=5) {\n                    digits[i +1]++;\n                }\n                bills +=5;\n            } else {\n                digits[i +1]++;\n                bills +=10 - digits[i];\n            }\n        }\n        System.out.println(bills);\n    }\n}\n\nAh, in the loop where i runs from 0 to number.length(), inclusive. The digits array is of size number.length() +1. So when i is number.length(), digits[i] is the last element. But in the code, when processing i, there are operations that access digits[i+1], which for i = number.length() would be digits[number.length()+1], which is out of the array's bounds (since the array's max index is number.length()). This is a bug in the Java code. But how come this code is from a programming contest and works? Or perhaps the input is such that digits[i] never reaches 10 when i is number.length(), so the digits[i+1] is not accessed in that case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing of digits[i], when i is the last index (number.length()), the code may have already handled any carryover, so digits[i] is not 10. Let's think.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code is correct. Because when processing digits[i], the first check is if digits[i] ==10. For example, if during processing a previous digit, a carryover caused digits[i] to become 10. Then, when processing i, we increment digits[i+1] and set digits[i] to 0. However, when i is the maximum index (number.length()), then digits[i+1] would be beyond the array. So this would cause an error. Therefore, the code must have a bug.\n\nBut how come this code is from a programming contest (AtCoder) and works? Maybe the problem constraints ensure that the digits don't reach 10 in the last position. Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect, but passes the test cases due to specific inputs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial digits array is such that the last digit (digits[number.length()]) is 0, and during processing, digits[i] for i=number.length() is processed. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the input is \"999\". Then digits array initially is [9,9,9,0]. Then during processing:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 9.\n\n9 >=5, so digits[i+1] is 9, increment it (now digits[1] becomes 10), bills += 1 (10-9=1).\n\ni=0 loop ends. Then next i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 10. So first, digits[1+1] +=1 (digits[2] becomes 10), set digits[1] to 0.\n\nThen check digits[i] (now 0) <5: add 0 to bills.\n\ni=1 loop ends. Then i=2:\n\ndigits[2] is 10. So digits[3] +=1 (digits[3] becomes 1), set digits[2] to 0.\n\ndigits[i] is 0: add 0 to bills.\n\ni=3:\n\ndigits[3] is 1. Less than 5: add 1. bills is 1 + 0 + 0 +1 = 2.\n\nWait, but the correct answer for 999 is 1000-999=1, but perhaps the code is not correct. Not sure. Anyway, the Java code may have a potential out-of-bounds error when i is number.length() and digits[i] is 10, leading to accessing digits[i+1] which is out of bounds.\n\nBut the problem says that this code is from atcoder_ABC155_E, so perhaps the code is correct for the problem's constraints, and the test cases don't have such cases. So when translating to Fortran, we need to handle this correctly.\n\nSo in Fortran, to avoid the out-of-bounds error, perhaps the digits array should have an extra element. Wait, no. Because in the Java code, the digits array is of size number.length() +1. So when i is number.length(), digits[i] is the last element, and digits[i+1] would be beyond the array. So the code has an error here.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, the code works because the first check for digits[i] ==10 is handled. For example, if during the processing of i=number.length(), digits[i] is 10. Then digits[i+1] is accessed, which is out of bounds. So the code will crash. Therefore, the code is incorrect.\n\nBut how to handle this in Fortran?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial setup ensures that digits[i] cannot be 10 when i is the last index. How?\n\nLooking at the code: during processing, digits[i] can be modified by the previous steps. Let's see:\n\nIn the loop for each i:\n\nFirst, check if digits[i] is 10. If yes, increment digits[i+1] by 1, set digits[i] to 0. So, for example, if during processing i=number.length() (the last index), and digits[i] is 10, then digits[i+1] is beyond the array. So this is a problem.\n\nSo the code is incorrect. However, maybe in the problem, the leading digit (digits[number.length()] after processing is not possible to be 10. How?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when processing digits[i], the digits[i] is initially 0 (since the digits array is initialized with 0 in the last position). But during processing, it could be incremented due to carryover from the previous digit.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, the code works because when i reaches number.length(), digits[i] is 0, and thus the code doesn't do anything. But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nThis seems like a bug. But since the user provided the code and wants a translation, I need to replicate the Java code's logic, including potential bugs.\n\nSo for the Fortran code, to avoid the out-of-bounds error, perhaps the digits array should have an extra element. Wait, but in Java, the array is of size number.length() +1. So in Fortran, the digits array should be of size 0 to len, where len is the input length. So when processing i = len (the last index), accessing i+1 would be len+1, which is beyond the array's size. Therefore, the code will have an out-of-bounds error.\n\nBut in Java, this would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, but the code is part of a problem that passed test cases. So perhaps the code is correct in practice.\n\nHmm. To proceed, perhaps in the Fortran code, we need to extend the digits array by one more element to handle the possible carryover in the last step.\n\nBut how? Let's think. For example, in Java, the digits array has len+1 elements, which allows up to i= len. So in Fortran, if we have digits(0:len+1), then when i is len, i+1 is len+1, which is within the array.\n\nBut then the initial digits array would have len+2 elements (0 to len+1). The initial digits array is set with len elements (reversed), and the remaining elements (len and len+1) are zero? Or perhaps the digits array in Fortran is declared with 0 to len+1, but initialized as 0. Then during processing, even if i is len, digits[i+1] is len+1, which is within the array.\n\nYes, that could work. So the Fortran code would:\n\n- Read the input string, get its length N.\n\n- Declare digits array as (0:N+1) initialized to 0.\n\n- Then, for i in 0 to N-1, set digits(i) to the reversed input digits.\n\nThen, during processing, when i loops from 0 to N, and when i is N, digits[i+1] is N+1, which is allowed.\n\nThis way, even if the last digit (i=N) is 10, we can increment digits[N+1], which is part of the array.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read the input string, say 'S'.\n\n2. Determine its length, N = LEN_TRIM(S). But in Fortran, when reading a string with leading zeros, perhaps the input is read correctly, but need to make sure that the string is processed properly. For example, if S is '000123', then it's processed as '000123', reversed to '321000'.\n\nBut the problem's code treats each character as a digit. So in Fortran, when reading S, leading zeros are allowed.\n\nThen:\n\n3. Allocate digits array as (0:N+1), initializing all to zero.\n\n4. For each character in S, reversed, assign to digits(0:N-1).\n\nFor example, for S of length N:\n\ndigits(0) = S(N:N) - '0'\n\ndigits(1) = S(N-1:N-1) - '0'\n\netc.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 0, N-1\n    digits(i) = ICHAR(S(N - i : N - i)) - ICHAR('0')\nend do\n\nWait, S is a character string of length N. The characters are from 1 to N. So for i=0, we want S's last character (position N). For i=1, position N-1, etc. So for each i in 0..N-1:\n\ndigits(i) = ICHAR(S(N - i : N -i)) - ICHAR('0')\n\nWait, let's see. For i=0: N-i = N-0 = N. But S has positions 1 to N. So in Fortran, the first character is S(1:1), the last is S(N:N). So for reversed order, for the original input '123' (N=3), digits(0) is 3 (S(3:3)), digits(1) is S(2:2) which is 2, digits(2) is 1.\n\nYes. So the loop would be:\n\ndo i = 0, N-1\n    pos = N - i\n    digits(i) = ICHAR(S(pos:pos)) - ICHAR('0')\nend do\n\nBut Fortran's ICHAR returns the ASCII code of the character. Subtracting ICHAR('0') converts the character to its digit value.\n\nOnce the digits array is initialized, the processing loop runs from i=0 to i=N (inclusive). For each i:\n\nCheck if digits(i) is 10. If so, increment digits(i+1) by 1 and set digits(i) to 0.\n\nThen, process the current digit:\n\nIf digits(i) <5: add to bills.\n\nIf ==5: check if digits(i+1) >=5. If yes, increment digits(i+1) by 1. Add 5 to bills.\n\nElse (digits(i) >5): increment digits(i+1) by 1, add (10 - digits(i)) to bills.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nSo:\n\nbills = 0\n\ndo i = 0, N\n    if (digits(i) == 10) then\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n        digits(i) = 0\n    endif\n\n    if (digits(i) <5) then\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n    else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n        if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n        endif\n        bills = bills +5\n    else\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n    endif\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop variable i must be an integer. Also, the digits array is 0-based to N+1. So in the loop, when i is N, i+1 is N+1, which is within the array.\n\nNow, the Fortran code needs to read the input string. Let's see.\n\nIn Fortran, the code could be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(1000000) :: S  ! Assuming maximum input size\n    integer :: N, i, pos, bills\n    integer, allocatable :: digits(:)\n\n    read(*,*) S\n    N = len_trim(S)\n    allocate(digits(0:N+1))\n    digits = 0\n\n    do i = 0, N-1\n        pos = N - i\n        digits(i) = ichar(S(pos:pos)) - ichar('0')\n    end do\n\n    bills = 0\n\n    do i = 0, N\n        if (digits(i) == 10) then\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n            digits(i) = 0\n        end if\n\n        if (digits(i) <5) then\n            bills = bills + digits(i)\n        else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n            if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n            end if\n            bills = bills +5\n        else\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n            bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, bills\n\nend program main\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the character variable S may need to be adjusted. When reading with read(*,*) S, it will read the input as a string, but leading and trailing spaces are ignored. Wait, no: the format * reads the input as a list of tokens. So if the input is \"123\", then S will be '123' with len_trim(S) =3. But if the input has leading spaces, they are skipped. But according to the problem, the input is a single integer as a string, possibly with leading zeros. So perhaps using read(*,'(a)') S would be better to read the entire line, including leading spaces.\n\nBut in Java, the code uses sc.next(), which reads the next token (without leading/trailing whitespace). So the Fortran code should read the input as a single token.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nread(*, '(a)') S\n\nBut then, the variable S may have trailing spaces. So trim it to get the length.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nread(*,*) S\n\nBut this would read the first token, trimming leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nBut the problem's input is a single non-negative integer. So in code submission, the input is a single line with the number, possibly with leading zeros.\n\nSo in Fortran, using read(*,'(a)') S will read the entire line, including leading and trailing spaces, which is not desired. So using read(*,*) S reads the input as a string token, which is correct.\n\nThen, N is the length of S after trimming.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read a character variable with read(*,*) S, it will read the next token (without leading/trailing spaces) and assign it to S, padded with spaces on the right if the variable's length is longer than the input. So if S is declared as character(1000000), and the input is \"123\", then S is '123' followed by 999997 spaces. But len_trim(S) would give 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code:\n\nread(*,*) S\n\nN = len_trim(S)\n\nBut for empty string? The problem's input is a non-negative integer, which can be zero. So S can be '0'.\n\nNow, the digits array is allocated as (0:N+1), which for N=0 (input '0') would be 0:1, which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, integer division and arithmetic is different. But in this code, it's all integer operations.\n\nNow, testing the code with input '36' (as an example from the problem statement? Not sure, but let's see).\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, the digits array is initialized with len+1 elements, and during processing, i runs up to len. But in the Fortran code, i runs up to N, where N is the original input's length. For example, input length 3 (digits array 0:3+1=4), i loops from 0 to 3 (N=3).\n\nYes. So the code should be correct.\n\nSo the final Fortran code is as written above.\n\nI need to make sure that all variables are declared properly.\n\nVariables:\n\n- S: character(1000000) is okay for the input size. Alternatively, read into a dynamically allocated string, but in Fortran 95 and earlier, this is not possible. So using a large enough length is better.\n\n- N: integer\n\n- i: loop variable\n\n- pos: integer\n\n- bills: integer, initialized to 0.\n\n- digits: allocated array of integers, size 0:N+1.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the code, the allocation is done with allocate(digits(0:N+1)). Wait, Fortran uses colon for array ranges. So to declare the array from 0 to N+1, the code is:\n\nallocate(digits(0:N+1))\n\nYes.\n\nThen, the digits array is initialized to 0. So after allocation, digits = 0 sets all elements to zero.\n\nThen, the loop to fill the digits(0:N-1) with reversed digits.\n\nThen, the processing loop.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nFor example, if the input is '36', the reversed digits are 6,3,0 (digits(0)=6, digits(1)=3, digits(2)=0). Wait, but according to the code:\n\nN = len_trim(S) which is 2.\n\ndigits array is 0:3 (N+1 is 2+1=3?), wait, no. Wait, the digits array is declared as 0:N+1. For N=2 (input length 2), digits is 0:3. So indices 0,1,2,3.\n\nThe code:\n\ndo i=0 to N-1 (which is 1). So i=0 and 1.\n\nFor i=0: pos = N - i = 2-0=2. So S(2:2) is '6'. digits(0) = 6.\n\ni=1: pos = 2-1=1. S(1:1) is '3'. digits(1) =3.\n\ndigits(2) and digits(3) are 0 initially.\n\nThen processing loop runs i=0 to 2 (N=2).\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits(0)=6. Not 10.\n\n6 >=5: else clause.\n\nIncrement digits(1) by 1 (3 becomes 4). bills += 10-6=4. Now bills=4.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1)=4 (was 3, but after increment by 1 becomes 4). So in processing i=1:\n\ndigits(1) is 4, less than 5. bills +=4. bills is 8.\n\ni=2:\n\ndigits(2) is 0. less than 5. add 0. bills remains 8.\n\nSo total bills is 4+4=8. Which matches the Java code's output.\n\nWait, but the Java code's sample input may vary. For example, what's the correct output for input '36'? According to the problem's logic, it's the minimal number of bills, which may be 8. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut the code is correct in replicating the Java code's logic.\n\nAnother example: input '99'.\n\nJava code:\n\ndigits array is [9,9,0]. Then processing:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0]=9>5: increment digits[1] to 10. bills +=1 (10-9=1).\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1]=10. So set digits[1] to 0, increment digits[2] to 1. Then, process digits[1]=0: add 0. Then check the 5 case. So bills +=0.\n\ni=2: digits[2] is 1. Add 1 to bills. Total bills is 1+0+1=2.\n\nBut the actual minimal bills would be 2 (since 100-99=1, but the code's logic gives 1+1=2). But perhaps the code's logic is correct according to the problem's specific rules.\n\nBut the Fortran code replicates the Java code's logic.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
