    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing.\n\nThe Java program reads N words and checks two conditions: \n1. All words are unique.\n2. Each subsequent word starts with the last character of the previous word.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n- Read N from input.\n- Read N words into a map (probably to keep track of them, but since we're checking for duplicates, maybe a list would suffice in Fortran since order matters here).\n- For each word, check if it's already been used (using the past HashMap in Java). If any duplicates, set ans to false.\n- Also check that the first character of the current word (except the first) matches the last character of the previous word. If not, set ans to false.\n- Finally, output \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on ans.\n\nIn Fortran, we don't have HashMaps, so for checking duplicates, perhaps we can use an array of strings and check each element against the current one. Since Fortran is case-insensitive, variables need to be uppercase or lowercase, but the code can be written in lowercase with appropriate declarations.\n\nFirst, let's outline the variables needed. In Java, they have a HashMap for 'map' which stores the words by index. But in the code, they're using past.containsValue(map.get(i)), which checks if the current word has been in the 'past' map. Wait, the 'past' map is being filled as the loop progresses. Wait, in the Java code, they're putting each word into 'past' as they go, and checking if the current word is already in 'past'. But since 'past' is filled in order, perhaps 'past' is just storing all previous words. Wait, no: in the loop, for each i from 0 to N-1, they add map.get(i) to past. Then, they check if past contains the current word. Wait, but the map 'past' is being filled with the current word, but for i=0, past is empty before checking. Wait, let's see:\n\nIn the loop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\n- Check if past contains the value map.get(i). If yes, ans=false.\n\nThen add map.get(i) to past.\n\nWait, but past is built as we go. So, for each i, we check if the current word (map.get(i)) has already been present in past (which contains all previous entries from i=0 to i-1). But initially, past is empty. So for i=0, past is empty, so the check would be false. Then, we add map.get(0) to past. For i=1, check if past (which now contains the 0th word) has map.get(1). If yes, duplicate. Then add it to past. So, this is checking for duplicates in the list. So, in Fortran, since we don't have a hashmap, we can use an array of strings and for each new word, check if it's already present in the previous entries.\n\nSo, first, read N, then read N words into an array. Then, iterate through each word, and for each position i (starting from 1?), check if the previous words (0 to i-1) have the same word. Also, check that the first character of the current word (for i >=1) matches the last character of the previous word.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the check for the first character is done by comparing the next variable. Let's look at that part.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nIf i is not 0, then check if next equals the first character of the current word. Next is set to the last character of the previous word.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter processing each word, next is set to the last character of that word. Then, in the next iteration, when i increases, the next is the last character of the previous word. For i=0, since it's the first word, there's no previous, so next is set to the last character of the first word. Then, for i=1, the code checks if next (last character of i=0) equals the first character of i=1. Then, next is set to the last character of i=1. For i=2, check next (last of i=1) equals first of i=2, etc.\n\nSo the logic is:\n\nFor each word (starting from i=0), after the first word (i>0), check that the first character matches the last character of the previous word.\n\nSo, in Fortran, after storing all words in an array, we can loop from 1 to N-1 (assuming 1-based index), and check two things:\n\n1. For each word at position i, check if it's already present in the array from 0 to i-1 (duplicate check).\n\n2. Check that the first character of word i matches the last character of word i-1.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first check is done by the past map. The past map is filled as we process each word. For i=0, we check if past contains the current word. Since past is empty, it's not. Then add to past. For i=1, check if the current word is in past (which now has i=0's word). So, the past map is being used to check all previous words. So in Fortran, for each word in position i (0-based?), we need to check if any of the previous words (from 0 to i-1) are the same as current word.\n\nSo, the steps for Fortran:\n\n1. Read N.\n\n2. Read N words into an array.\n\n3. Initialize ans = .true.\n\n4. For each i from 1 to N (assuming 1-based array in Fortran?), but maybe 0-based or 1-based depends on how we read.\n\nWait, in Fortran, array indices can start from 1, which is common. So let's assume 1-based.\n\nLoop for i = 2 to N:\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each word starting from the second one, check if any previous word (1 to i-1) is equal to current word.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 2, N\n\n   do j = 1, i-1\n\n      if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n\n          ans = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      endif\n\n   enddo\n\nenddo\n\nBut this is O(N^2), which could be acceptable for small N.\n\nBut in the Java code, they check for the presence of the current word in the past words. So for each i, check if the current word is present in the words from 0 to i-1.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i starting from 1 (assuming 1-based array), loop from 1 to i-1 and check if any previous entry matches.\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is for i from 0 to N-1. For each i, check if past contains the current word. Then add it to past. So, past contains all words processed so far (including the current i? No. Wait, in the loop, for i=0: check if past contains map.get(0). Since past is empty, no. Then add map.get(0) to past. So after processing i=0, past has the 0th word.\n\nFor i=1: check if past (has 0th) contains map.get(1). Then add to past.\n\nSo, the check is for the current word being present in any of the previous words (0 to i-1). So for each i (starting from 0?), check if the current word is present in the words 0 to i-1.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is for i from 0 to N-1. So for the first iteration (i=0), past is empty. So the check is for map.get(0) being in past, which is empty. So that check is false. Then, past.put(i, ...). So after i=0, past contains the 0th word.\n\nFor i=1, check if past (contains 0th word) contains map.get(1). So the check is if the current word is in the previous words (0 to i-1). So for each i, the current word is checked against all previous entries (0 to i-1) in the past map. Therefore, in Fortran, for each i from 1 to N (assuming 1-based), check if any previous entries (1 to i-1) have the same word.\n\nSo, the code needs to check for duplicates in the array up to the current index.\n\nSo, for Fortran:\n\nRead N.\n\nAllocate an array of size N.\n\nRead each word into the array.\n\nSet ans = .true.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to N:\n\n   Check if the word at i is present in the array from 1 to i-1.\n\n   Also, for i>1, check that the first character of word i matches the last character of word i-1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   ! Check for duplicate\n\n   do j = 1, i-1\n\n      if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n\n          ans = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      endif\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Check the chain\n\n   if (i > 1) then\n\n      prev_word = words(i-1)\n\n      current_word = words(i)\n\n      if (current_word(1:1) /= prev_word(len_trim(prev_word):len_trim(prev_word))) then\n\n          ans = .false.\n\n      endif\n\n   endif\n\n   ! Exit loop if ans is false\n\n   if (.not. ans) exit\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is for each word, and after checking the current word against the past entries (duplicates) and checking the first character against the previous word's last character (for i>0), it breaks early if any condition is false.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to loop through each word, and for each, check the two conditions. If either fails, set ans to .false. and exit.\n\nBut the way the Java code is structured is that for each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n- Check if past contains the current word (i.e., check if any previous word (0 to i-1) is equal to current word). If yes, ans is false.\n\n- Then, if i !=0, check that the current word's first character matches next (which is the last character of previous word). Then, set next to current word's last character.\n\nWait, the Java code's 'next' variable is set to the last character of the current word. So:\n\nInitially, next is empty.\n\nFor i=0:\n\n- check if past contains word (no, since past is empty).\n\n- add to past.\n\n- since i==0, skip the chain check.\n\n- set next to last character of word[0].\n\nFor i=1:\n\n- check if past contains word[1] (past has word[0], so if word[1] is same as word[0], ans is false).\n\n- if not, check chain: next (last char of word[0]) must equal first char of word[1].\n\n- set next to last char of word[1].\n\nSo, in Fortran, perhaps the way to model this is to track the last character of the previous word.\n\nInitialize last_char as empty.\n\nLoop through each word from 1 to N (assuming 1-based):\n\nFor the first word (i=1):\n\n- check duplicates: any previous words (none, so no check needed?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the Java code, for i=0 (the first word), it checks if past contains it (which is no), adds to past, and then sets next to its last character.\n\nThen, for i=1, check if past (contains word[0]) contains word[1]. So in Fortran, for i=2 (if 1-based?), no. Wait, perhaps it's better to use 0-based indices in Fortran if possible. But Fortran arrays can start at 0.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based.\n\nLet me structure the code as follows:\n\nRead N.\n\nAllocate a character array, words(N).\n\nRead N words into words.\n\nInitialize ans = .true.\n\nInitialize a character variable last_char as empty.\n\nThen, loop over i from 1 to N:\n\n   current_word = words(i)\n\n   ! Check if current_word has appeared before (in 1 to i-1)\n\n   do j = 1, i-1\n\n      if (current_word == words(j)) then\n\n          ans = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      endif\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. ans) exit\n\n   ! Check chain condition (if not first word)\n\n   if (i > 1) then\n\n      previous_word = words(i-1)\n\n      if (current_word(1:1) /= last_char) then\n\n          ans = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      endif\n\n   endif\n\n   ! Update last_char to current_word's last character\n\n   last_char = current_word(len_trim(current_word):len_trim(current_word))\n\nend do\n\nWait, but for i=1, the previous word is i-1=0, but in 1-based array, that would be out of bounds. Wait, this is a confusion.\n\nWait, if the array is 1-based, the first element is 1, second 2, etc. So for i=1, there's no previous word (since it's the first one). So the chain condition (checking previous) starts from i=2.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for i=0 (first word), after processing, next is set to its last character. Then, when i=1 (second word), the code checks if next (last char of first word) equals first char of current word.\n\nSo, in Fortran, for the first iteration (i=1), we don't check the chain, but after processing, we set last_char to the last character of the first word. Then, for i=2 (second iteration), we check that the first character of word 2 equals last_char (from word 1), then update last_char to word 2's last character.\n\nSo the loop would be:\n\nInitialize last_char as empty.\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   ! Check duplicates in previous words (words 1 to i-1)\n\n   do j = 1, i-1\n\n      if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n\n          ans = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      endif\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. ans) exit\n\n   ! Check chain condition, except for the first word\n\n   if (i > 1) then\n\n      if (words(i)(1:1) /= last_char) then\n\n          ans = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      endif\n\n   endif\n\n   ! Update last_char to current word's last character\n\n   last_char = words(i)(len_trim(words(i)): len_trim(words(i)))\n\nend do\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nNow, the code structure in Fortran would look like:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: N, i, j, length\n\n    character(len=20), allocatable :: words(:)\n\n    logical :: ans\n\n    character :: last_char\n\n    ! Read N\n\n    read(*,*) N\n\n    allocate(words(N))\n\n    ! Read N words\n\n    do i = 1, N\n\n        read(*,*) words(i)\n\n    end do\n\n    ans = .true.\n\n    last_char = ''\n\n    do i = 1, N\n\n        ! Check for duplicates in previous words\n\n        do j = 1, i-1\n\n            if (words(i) == words(j)) then\n\n                ans = .false.\n\n                exit\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        if (.not. ans) exit\n\n        ! Check chain condition if not first word\n\n        if (i > 1) then\n\n            if (words(i)(1:1) /= last_char) then\n\n                ans = .false.\n\n                exit\n\n            end if\n\n        end if\n\n        ! Update last_char\n\n        length = len_trim(words(i))\n\n        last_char = words(i)(length:length)\n\n    end do\n\n    if (ans) then\n\n        print *, \"Yes\"\n\n    else\n\n        print *, \"No\"\n\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(words)\n\nend program main\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the 'past' map is being filled with all previous words. So in the Fortran code, the check for duplicates is correctly done by comparing each current word with all previous ones.\n\nHowever, there's a possible issue with the length of the words. In the Java code, each word is read as a String. In Fortran, when reading with list-directed input (read(*,*)), the length is determined by the input, but the variable is declared with a fixed length (here, 20). So if a word is longer than 20 characters, it will be truncated. But the Java code doesn't have this limitation. So perhaps the Fortran code should use a longer length, or adjust as needed. But since the problem may not have such cases, this is acceptable.\n\nAnother thing: the initial last_char is set to empty. In Fortran, a character variable can't be empty unless declared with length 0, but here, last_char is a single character. So initializing it to a space or some default. But when i=1 (first word), after processing, last_char is set to the last character of the first word. For i=2, the check uses last_char from i=1.\n\nWait, for i=1:\n\n- No chain check (since i>1 is false)\n\n- Update last_char to the last character of the first word.\n\nFor i=2:\n\n- Check if words(2) starts with last_char (from i=1).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nTesting sample input:\n\nFor example, input:\n\n3\n\napple\n\neach\n\nhigh\n\nThe Java code would check:\n\napple is first, no duplicates. Then each starts with 'e' (last char of apple is 'e'), then high starts with 'h' (last char of each is 'h'). All ok. Output Yes.\n\nIn Fortran, the code should output Yes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\n2\n\nabc\n\ncba\n\nabc is first. No duplicates. Then cba: starts with 'c' (last char of abc is 'c')? Wait, abc's last character is 'c'. So next word should start with 'c'. cba starts with 'c'. So ans is yes.\n\nAnother test case where a duplicate exists:\n\n3\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nThen, the second 'a' is duplicate. So ans is no.\n\nIn Fortran code, when i=2, j runs from 1 to 1 (i-1=1). words(2) is 'a' same as words(1) 'a', so ans becomes false.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case where chain is broken:\n\n3\n\napple\n\negg\n\ngorilla\n\napple's last is 'e', egg starts with 'e' (ok). egg's last is 'g', gorilla starts with 'g' (ok). So output yes.\n\nAnother case where chain is broken:\n\n2\n\nabc\n\ndef\n\nabc's last character is 'c'. def starts with 'd' \u2192 not same. So ans becomes false.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle all these cases.\n\nThus, the code should correctly translate the Java code."
