    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nSo, the problem is from atcoder ABC104_C. The code reads D and G, then reads D pairs of p and c. It seems to be solving a problem where you need to find the minimum number of problems to solve to get a score of at least G. The approach uses bitmasking to try all combinations of which problems to solve completely, and then fills in with partial problems if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to map the Java constructs to Fortran. Let's go step by step.\n\nThe Java code uses a Scanner to read input. In Fortran, we'll use READ statements. The variables D is an integer, G is a long in Java, so in Fortran, maybe integer(kind=8) for G? But wait, G is a score, maybe it's just a large integer, but since in Fortran, integers can be 4 or 8 bytes. Let me check the problem constraints. Since G can be up to 1e12, according to some ABC problems, so yes, G should be a 64-bit integer. So in Fortran, declare G as integer(kind=8).\n\nThen, there are arrays p and c, each of size D. In Fortran, these will be dimension(D) arrays.\n\nThe main part is the bitmask loop. Java uses a loop from bit=0 to (1<<D)-1. In Fortran, bit can be an integer that's looped from 0 to 2**D - 1. But since D can be up to 10 (since in the problem, D is up to 10), 2^10 is 1024, which is manageable.\n\nFor each bitmask, they check which bits are set. For each set bit, they accumulate the score and the number of solved problems. Then, if the score is still less than G, they look for the highest problem not in the bitmask and solve as many as possible (without getting the c bonus) to reach G.\n\nIn Fortran, we can represent the bitmask similarly. For each bit in the mask, check if the i-th bit is set. In Java, (bit & (1 << i)) != 0. In Fortran, we can use BTEST(bit, i). Wait, but Fortran's bits are 0-based? Let me confirm. The BTEST(i, pos) function returns .true. if the pos-th bit (starting from 0 for the least significant bit) is set in the integer i. So for bit=bitmask, to check if the i-th position (from 0 to D-1) is set, we can use BTEST(bit, i). Wait, but in the Java code, the loop runs for i from 0 to D-1. So the code is checking each bit in the mask for each i. So in Fortran, for each i in 0 to D-1, check if the bit is set. That should work.\n\nNow, in the Java code, for each bit set, they add 100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i] to the score. Wait, why i+1? Because the problem numbers start from 1. For problem i (0-based in the array), the score per problem is 100*(i+1). So in Fortran, when we loop over i from 0 to D-1, if the bit is set, we add 100*(i+1)*p(i+1) + c(i+1). Wait, wait. Wait, the arrays in Java are zero-based. So p[i] in Java corresponds to p(i+1) in Fortran if the array is declared from 1 to D. But maybe in the Fortran code, the arrays are zero-based. Let's see.\n\nIn Fortran, it's common to use 1-based indexing, but you can use any. Let me think: in the code, the original code has i from 0 to D-1. So in Fortran, if I have the arrays p and c starting from 1 to D, then for i from 0 to D-1 in the loop, the corresponding array indices are i+1. But that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe declare the arrays from 0 to D-1. Let's do that. Because in Fortran, you can declare arrays with lower bounds. So:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:D-1) :: p, c\n\nBut when D is read from input, we need to allocate them. Wait, in Fortran, you can't have variable-length arrays in the main program unless you use allocatable. Wait, no, if you use a subprogram, but in the main program, you can use:\n\ninteger :: D\ninteger, allocatable :: p(:), c(:)\nread *, D\nallocate(p(0:D-1), c(0:D-1))\n\nThen, in the loops, for i from 0 to D-1, you can read p(i) and c(i). That way, the code structure is similar to Java.\n\nSo the arrays will be 0-based, which aligns with the Java code's indices. That makes translation easier.\n\nNext, the bitmask loop. The loop in Java is for (bit = 0; bit < (1 << D); bit++). So in Fortran, we can loop bit from 0 to 2**D - 1. But 2**D can be calculated as ishft(1, D), which is 1 shifted left by D bits. But in Fortran, the exponentiation operator is **. So 2**D is the same as 1 << D in Java. So in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ndo bit = 0, (2**D)-1\n   ...\nend do\n\nBut D can be up to 10, 2^10=1024, so 1024 iterations, which is okay.\n\nThen, for each bit, we check each i (0 to D-1) to see if the bit is set. So in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 0, D-1\n   if (btest(bit, i)) then\n      score = score + 100*(i+1)*p(i) + c(i)\n      solve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n   end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, it's (i+1)*100 per problem. Because i is 0-based. So problem 0 is worth 100 points, problem 1 is 200, etc. So yes, multiply by (i+1).\n\nThen, if the score is still less than G, we need to loop from the highest problem (D-1) down to 0, and find the first problem not included in the bitmask. For each such problem, add as many as possible (up to p[i] -1, since solving all would trigger the c[i] bonus, which is already considered if the bit is set). Then, add those scores until score >= G.\n\nIn the Java code, this is done with a labeled loop (loop:), breaking when the score is sufficient. In Fortran, since there's no labeled loop, we can use a named loop and exit when needed.\n\nSo in Fortran, inside the if (score < G) block, we can have:\n\nouter: do i = D-1, 0, -1\n   if (.not. btest(bit, i)) then\n      do j = 0, p(i) - 1\n         score = score + 100 * (i+1)\n         solve_num = solve_num + 1\n         if (score >= G) then\n            exit outer\n         end if\n      end do\n   end if\nend do outer\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i = D - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    if ((bit & (1 << i)) == 0) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < p[i] -1; j++) {\n            score += 100*(i+1);\n            solve_num++;\n            if (score >= G) break loop;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, the outer loop is over i from D-1 downto 0, then check if the bit is not set. Then, loop j from 1 to p[i]-1 (since adding up to p[i]-1 problems). Wait, in the Java code, j starts from 0 and runs p[i]-1 times. So j in 0..p[i]-2? Wait, no: j runs from 0 to p[i]-1 -1. Because the loop is for (j=0; j < p[i]-1; j++), which is p[i]-1 iterations. So in Fortran, the inner loop is do j = 1, p(i)-1.\n\nWait, no: in Java, j runs from 0 to (p[i]-1 -1) because the condition is j < p[i]-1. So for p[i]-1 times. So in Fortran, the loop would be do j = 1, p(i)-1. Because j starts at 1 and ends at p(i)-1, which gives p(i)-1 iterations. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the code, when adding j times, each adds 100*(i+1) points, and solve_num increments by 1 each time. So for each j in 1..p[i]-1, add once. So the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo j = 1, p(i) -1\n   score = score + 100 * (i + 1)\n   solve_num = solve_num + 1\n   if (score >= G) exit outer\nend do\n\nBut we have to exit the entire outer loop once any j loop causes the score to reach G. So in Fortran, we can use a named loop (outer) and exit it when the condition is met.\n\nBut in the code, after adding each j, check if score >= G. If yes, break out of the outer loop (which is labeled loop: in Java). So in Fortran, the outer loop is named, and the exit statement exits the named loop.\n\nThen, after this part, check if score >= G. If yes, update the min.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the outer loop, check if score >= G. If yes, then min = min(min, solve_num).\n\nSo in Fortran, min is initialized to INF, which is 100000. Then, whenever the current solve_num is less than min, update min.\n\nNow, variables declaration.\n\nIn Java, min is an int initialized to INF. In Fortran, it's an integer. The variables score and solve_num in Java are int. So in Fortran, they can be integer(kind=8) to handle large numbers. Or perhaps regular integers. Since G can be up to 1e12, adding 100*(i+1) per problem, but the solve_num is up to sum(p) plus some. Since D is up to 10 and each p is up to 100, the maximum solve_num would be 10*100 + ... maybe 1000. So integer(kind=4) is sufficient.\n\nBut score can be up to 1e12. Let's see. Each problem contributes 100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i]. For D=10, i+1=10, p=100, that's 100*10*100=1e5 per problem. Multiply by 10, 1e6. Plus c[i], which could be 1e5 each. So 1e6 + 1e5*10 = 2e6. Then adding the partial problems. For example, adding up to 99 problems (since p[i]-1=99) for a problem worth 1000 points (i=9) would add 99*1000 = 99,000. So total score can be up to around 2e6 + 1e5 = 2.1e6. But wait, in the problem statement, G can be up to 1e12. So if the initial sum from the bitmask is insufficient, and you have to add a lot of problems. Wait, no. Because you can't solve more than p[i]-1 problems for any unselected problem. So if the bitmask's score is still insufficient, you look for the highest problem not selected and add as many as possible (up to p[i]-1). So the maximum possible added score is (p[i]-1)*100*(i+1). For example, if you have a problem with i=9 (10th problem), p[i]=100, then adding 99 problems gives 99 * 100 * 10 = 99,000. But if G is up to 1e12, this would be impossible. Wait, perhaps in the problem, the initial selection of the bitmask must have all possible problems, but if the code is allowed to select a subset where even after adding all possible partials, the score is still not enough, then that bitmask is skipped. So the code only considers the bitmask where the score plus possible partials can reach G. But in that case, if G is very high, the code may not find a solution. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that there is a solution.\n\nBut in any case, the variables in the code can hold up to 1e12. So in Fortran, score and G must be 64-bit integers. So G is read as a 64-bit integer, and score should be a 64-bit integer. Similarly, the variables p and c are arrays of integers. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: G, score\ninteger :: D, min, solve_num, bit, i, j\ninteger, allocatable :: p(:), c(:)\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read into G, you need to use the correct format. So when reading G, since it's a large integer, use read *, G. But Fortran's default integer is 4 bytes, but if we declare G as integer(kind=8), then using read with the correct kind.\n\nWait, but the input is given as numbers. For example, the input could be:\n\n2 700\n3 500\n5 800\n\nWhich would mean D=2, G=700, then p[0] =3, c[0] =500, p[1]=5, c[1]=800.\n\nSo in Fortran, when reading G as a 64-bit integer, the code would be:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: G\nread *, D, G\nallocate(p(0:D-1), c(0:D-1))\ndo i = 0, D-1\n   read *, p(i), c(i)\nend do\n\nNow, the main variables: min is initialized to INF, which is 100000. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger, parameter :: INF = 100000\nmin = INF\n\nThen, loop over all possible bitmasks:\n\ndo bit = 0, 2**D -1\n\nBut wait, 2**D can be a large number. For D=10, 2^10=1024. But in Fortran, 2**D is computed as an integer. But if D is up to 30, 2**D can exceed the 32-bit integer limit. However, in this problem, D is up to 10, so 2^10=1024 is okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the exponentiation 2**D is done as integers. For D up to 30, 2**30 is about 1e9, which is within 32-bit integer's limit (2^31-1 is 2147483647). But for D=31, 2^31 is 2147483648, which exceeds 32-bit signed integer. So if D could be larger, but according to the problem statement, D is up to 10, so no problem.\n\nThen, for each bitmask, reset score and solve_num to 0.\n\nscore = 0\nsolve_num = 0\n\nThen, loop over each i in 0 to D-1, check if bit is set. If so, accumulate score and solve_num.\n\nThen, after processing all bits, check if score is less than G. If so, loop through the problems in reverse order, find the first not selected, add as many problems as possible.\n\nIn Fortran, the code for this part would be:\n\nif (score < G) then\n   outer: do i = D-1, 0, -1\n      if (.not. btest(bit, i)) then\n         do j = 1, p(i) -1\n            score = score + 100 * (i + 1)\n            solve_num = solve_num + 1\n            if (score >= G) then\n               exit outer\n            end if\n         end do\n      end if\n   end do outer\nend if\n\nThen, check if score >= G. If so, update min.\n\nif (score >= G) then\n   if (solve_num < min) then\n      min = solve_num\n   end if\nend if\n\nAt the end, after all bitmasks, print min.\n\nprint *, min\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The BTEST function in Fortran takes an integer and a position. Since bit can be up to 2^10-1, which is 1023, so in 32-bit integers, that's okay.\n\n- The variables must be properly initialized for each bitmask.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the loop for j in (p[i]-1) runs from 0 to p[i]-2. So adding (p[i]-1) problems. So in Fortran, the loop j runs from 1 to p(i)-1 (inclusive), which is correct.\n\nTesting this code with sample inputs.\n\nFor example, the sample input 1:\n\n2 700\n3 500\n5 800\n\nThe expected output is 3.\n\nLet's see how the code handles this.\n\nD=2, G=700.\n\np = [3,5], c = [500,800].\n\nThe bitmask loops from 0 to 3 (since 2^2-1=3).\n\nFor bit=0b00 (0), score is 0. Then, check if score < 700. Enter the outer loop. i=1 (the second problem, index 1). Not selected. So j runs from 1 to 4 (since p[1]-1=5-1=4). Each j adds 200 points (i+1=2). So adding 200 per problem. 700 / 200 is 3.5. So need 4 problems. But j runs up to 4. So after j=4, score is 0 + 4*200 = 800. solve_num=4. Then, since score >=700, min becomes 4. Then, check other bitmasks.\n\nFor bit=0b01 (1). Selected i=0. score is 100*1*3 +500 = 300+500=800. solve_num=3. Since 800 >=700, min is min(100000,3) \u21923.\n\nSo the correct answer is 3. Which is the minimum.\n\nSo the code should output 3. Which the Fortran code should handle correctly.\n\nAnother possible test case.\n\nPotential issues in Fortran code:\n\n- All variables are properly initialized for each bitmask.\n\n- Handling of 64-bit integers. For example, G being read as a 64-bit integer. So in the read statement, read *, D, G. But when reading from standard input, the default integer for G may be 4 bytes. Wait, no: if G is declared as integer(kind=8), then read with format or as free-form should read it as 8-byte integer. But depends on the compiler. For example, using GNU Fortran, when you read a large number into an integer(kind=8), it should work as long as the input is within the range.\n\nBut in practice, for numbers larger than 2^31-1, you need to read them as 8-byte integers. So in the code, we need to read G as integer(kind=8). So:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: G\n\nYes.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, when you compute 2**D, if D is 10, then 2**10 is 1024, which is okay. But the loop is from 0 to 2**D -1, which for D=10 is 1023.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo the Fortran code would look like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC104_C\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: INF = 100000\n    integer :: D, min_val, solve_num, bit, i, j\n    integer(kind=8) :: G, score\n    integer, allocatable :: p(:), c(:)\n\n    read *, D, G\n    allocate(p(0:D-1), c(0:D-1))\n    do i = 0, D-1\n        read *, p(i), c(i)\n    end do\n\n    min_val = INF\n\n    do bit = 0, 2**D - 1\n        score = 0\n        solve_num = 0\n\n        ! Process all selected problems\n        do i = 0, D-1\n            if (btest(bit, i)) then\n                score = score + 100 * (i + 1) * p(i) + c(i)\n                solve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        if (score < G) then\n            outer: do i = D-1, 0, -1\n                if (.not. btest(bit, i)) then\n                    do j = 1, p(i) - 1\n                        score = score + 100 * (i + 1)\n                        solve_num = solve_num + 1\n                        if (score >= G) then\n                            exit outer\n                        end if\n                    end do\n                end if\n            end do outer\n        end if\n\n        if (score >= G .and. solve_num < min_val) then\n            min_val = solve_num\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, min_val\n\n    deallocate(p, c)\nend program atcoder_ABC104_C\n\nWait, but in the code, when processing the partial problems (the j loop), in the Java code, it's j < p[i]-1. So j runs p[i]-1 times. In Fortran, the loop is j=1 to p(i)-1, which is correct.\n\nWait, no. For example, if p(i) is 3, then j runs from 1 to 2 (since p(i)-1=2), so two iterations. Which is correct. Because in Java, j runs from 0 to 1 (inclusive), which is 2 iterations. So yes, Fortran's loop j=1 to p(i)-1 is correct.\n\nBut what if p(i) is 1? Then p(i)-1 is 0, the loop j=1 to 0, which doesn't run. Which is correct, because you can't add any more problems.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the loop over bit, when D is zero? But D is given as input. According to the problem statement, D is at least 1.\n\nSo the code should handle D=1 to 10.\n\nAnother check: when the bitmask has all bits set. Then, all problems are solved completely, so there's no need to add partial problems.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n2 700\n3 500\n5 800\n\nThe code should output 3.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor bit=0b01 (bit=1):\n\ni=0 is set. So score is 3*100*1 +500= 300 +500=800. solve_num=3. Which is >=700. So min becomes 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: sample input 2.\n\nBut without knowing other test cases, perhaps proceed.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
