In Java:\n\nwhile (sk > 0) {\n    int idx = n-1; // Java's last index\n    while (sk >0 && idx >= n -k) {\n        ans[idx--]++; \n        sk--;\n    }\n}\n\nSo each iteration of the outer loop starts idx at the end again. Wait, no. Wait, the outer loop is a while (sk>0), and inside, the inner loop starts idx at n-1 and processes elements until idx >=n-k, which is the k elements. So in Java, each time through the outer loop, the inner loop starts from the end again. So for example, if sk is 5 and k=3, the first iteration of the inner loop processes elements 2,1,0 (if n=3?), wait maybe n is 3, k=3. So in Java, idx starts at 2, then 1, then 0. So each element is increased once, sk becomes 2. Then outer loop runs again, inner loop starts from 2 again, increases to 3, then sk becomes 1. Then again, etc. Wait, no.",

Inner loop starts idx=2 again, adds 1 each to 2,1,0. sk becomes 2-3= -1, but wait, that's not possible. Wait, no, sk is 5. Let's see: Wait, in the first iteration, sk=5. idx starts at 2 (n-1).

So after initializing ans to l, we compute:\n\nsAll = sAll - sk - (n - k) * l\nsk = sk - k * l\n\nNow, need to handle possible negative values? Probably not, since the problem's constraints probably ensure that sk >=k*l and sAll >= sk + (n -k)*l. But in code, the Java code doesn't check, so the Fortran code shouldn't either. So in Fortran:\n\nAfter initializing ans to l:\n\nsAll = sAll - sk - (n - k) * l\nsk = sk - k * l\n\nThen, the loops to distribute sk and sAll. Now, handling the loops:\n\nFor sk distribution:\n\nLoop while sk >0:\n\n   idx starts at n (Fortran's last element)\n   loop while sk>0 and idx >= (n -k +1)\n      increment ans(idx), decrement sk and idx. But in Fortran, the loop structure is:\n\nDO WHILE (sk > 0)\n    idx = n\n    DO WHILE (sk > 0 .AND. idx >= (n -k +1))\n        ans(idx) = ans(idx) + 1\n        sk = sk - 1\n        idx = idx -1\n    END DO\nEND DO\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the DO WHILE loop checks the condition at the top. So in the inner loop, we have to check if idx >= (n -k +1) and sk>0.",

Let's check. But in Fortran, the do while loops need to have proper syntax. For example, in the sk distribution loop:\n\ndo while (sk > 0)\n    i = n\n    do while (sk > 0 .and. i > = (n -k +1))\n        ans(i) = ans(i) +1\n        sk = sk -1\n        i = i -1\n    end do\nend do\n\nYes. But what if n -k +1 is larger than n? For example, if k=0. But according to the problem statement, probably k is at least 1. So the code assumes that. Similarly, in the sAll loop:\n\ndo while (sAll > 0) i =1\n    do while (sAll >0 .and. i <= (n -k))\n        ans(i) = ans(i) +1\n        sAll = sAll -1 i = i +1\n    end do\nend do\n\nYes.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe code reads inputs: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk. Then it generates an array of integers based on these parameters. The main method calls getPoints, which fills the array. \n\nFirst, the array is filled with l. Then, sAll and sk are adjusted by subtracting some values. Then, there are two loops: one distributes the remaining sk points to the last k elements (since idx starts from n-1 and goes to n-k), and the other distributes the remaining sAll to the first n-k elements. \n\nSo, in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let me think about the steps.\n\nFortran uses arrays differently. I need to declare the array, fill it with l initially. Then handle the sk and sAll distribution. \n\nFirst, the input: Fortran reads from standard input with READ(*,*). So I'll read the variables n, k, l, r, sAll, sk. Then call a function or subroutine that returns the array.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions return values, but subroutines can modify arguments. Since the Java method returns an array, I'll probably use a subroutine that takes an array as an out parameter.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the getPoints method creates a new array, fills it, and returns it. So in Fortran, the subroutine should allocate or have the array passed in.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays need to have their dimensions specified. The main program will have to declare the array after getting n as input. Wait, in Java, n is read from input, so in Fortran, I need to read n first, then allocate the array.\n\nWait, the Java code's main method first reads n, then the other variables. So the Fortran code should read n first, then k, l, etc. Then, the array ans is of size n.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I'll need to read the inputs in order. Then, create the array with size n. Then pass it to a subroutine that fills it according to the logic.\n\nSo the main steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n, k, l, r, sAll, sk from input.\n2. Initialize the ans array with n elements, all set to l.\n3. Adjust sAll and sk as per the Java code.\n4. Distribute the remaining sk over the last k elements.\n5. Distribute the remaining sAll over the first n - k elements.\n6. Print the array.\n\nNow, handling the loops. In Java, the first while loop adds 1 to the last k elements until sk is zero. For example, if sk is 5 and k=3, each element gets 1 until sk is 2, then two elements get an extra 1.\n\nBut in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default. Wait, Java uses 0-based, Fortran uses 1-based. So in Java, ans has indexes from 0 to n-1. In Fortran, from 1 to n. So the last k elements in Java are indexes n-k to n-1. In Fortran, that translates to indexes (n - k + 1) to n. \n\nWait, Java's array is 0-based. For example, if n is 5 and k is 2, the last k elements are indexes 3 and 4 (0-based). In Fortran, indexes 4 and 5 (if the array is size 5). So when converting, the loop in Fortran for the sk distribution should start from n and go down to n - k +1.\n\nWait, let's say Java's code uses idx starting from n-1 (the last element) and works backwards until idx >= n -k. For example, n=5, k=3: n-k=2, so indices 2,3,4 in Java (0-based). Which are elements 3,4,5 in Fortran (1-based). So in Fortran, the indexes for the sk loop would be from n down to (n -k + 1). Let me check: n -k +1 = 5 -3 +1 =3. So indexes 5,4,3. Which are the last three elements. Correct.\n\nSo the sk loop in Fortran would start at idx =n and decrement to (n -k +1). \n\nSimilarly, the sAll loop in Java distributes to the first (n -k) elements. In Java, indexes 0 to (n -k -1). In Fortran, indexes 1 to (n -k). So the loop in Fortran would go from idx=1 to (n -k).\n\nNow, the steps for the sk distribution. The Java code uses a while loop where sk>0. Inside, there's a loop that goes from idx =n-1 down to n-k. For each iteration, they increment ans[idx], decrement sk and idx. So in Fortran, the same approach: while sk >0, iterate over the k elements (starting from n down to (n-k+1)), adding 1 each time until sk is zero.\n\nBut how to handle the distribution? For example, if sk is 7 and k=3, each element gets 2 (total 6) and one element gets an extra 1. So the code in Java loops through the elements in reverse order, adding 1 each time until sk is 0.\n\nIn Fortran, the same approach: a loop that cycles through the last k elements, adding 1 each time. So perhaps:\n\nDO WHILE (sk > 0)\n   idx = n\n   DO WHILE (sk >0 .AND. idx >= (n -k +1))\n      ans(idx) = ans(idx) + 1\n      sk = sk -1\n      idx = idx -1\n   END DO\nEND DO\n\nWait, but the outer loop in Java is while(sk>0), and inside, idx starts from n-1 (Java's last index). So in Fortran, the inner loop would start from n and go down to (n -k +1), each time adding 1 and decrementing sk. But how to structure this? Let's see.\n\nIn Java:\n\nwhile (sk > 0) {\n    int idx = n-1; // Java's last index\n    while (sk >0 && idx >= n -k) {\n        ans[idx--]++; \n        sk--;\n    }\n}\n\nSo each iteration of the outer loop starts idx at the end again. Wait, no. Wait, the outer loop is a while (sk>0), and inside, the inner loop starts idx at n-1 and processes elements until idx >=n-k, which is the k elements. So in Java, each time through the outer loop, the inner loop starts from the end again. So for example, if sk is 5 and k=3, the first iteration of the inner loop processes elements 2,1,0 (if n=3?), wait maybe n is 3, k=3. So in Java, idx starts at 2, then 1, then 0. So each element is increased once, sk becomes 2. Then outer loop runs again, inner loop starts from 2 again, increases to 3, then sk becomes 1. Then again, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, the idx is initialized to n-1 inside the outer loop. So each time the outer loop runs (the while sk>0), the inner loop starts idx at n-1 and processes elements until sk>0 and idx >=n-k.\n\nSo for example, sk=5, k=3. First iteration of the outer loop: inner loop runs idx=2, 1, 0 (if n=3), adding 3 to sk. Then sk is 5-3=2. Then outer loop runs again. Inner loop starts idx=2 again, adds 1 each to 2,1,0. sk becomes 2-3= -1, but wait, that's not possible. Wait, no, sk is 5. Let's see:\n\nWait, in the first iteration, sk=5. idx starts at 2 (n-1). Process elements 2, 1, 0. sk decremented each time. So after processing these 3 elements, sk is 5-3=2. Then, inner loop exits. But since sk is still >0, the outer loop repeats. Again, idx is initialized to 2. Process elements 2,1,0 again. sk becomes 2-3= -1. Wait, that can't be. So maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, the code in Java is:\n\nwhile (sk >0) {\n    int idx = n-1;\n    while (sk>0 && idx >=n -k) {\n        ans[idx--]++; \n        sk--;\n    }\n}\n\nSo for sk=5 and k=3, the first time through the inner loop, idx starts at n-1 (e.g., 2 if n=3). Then, sk is decremented 3 times (idx 2,1,0). sk becomes 5-3=2. Then, outer loop continues because sk>0. Then inner loop starts idx at 2 again. sk is 2. The loop runs while sk>0 and idx >=0 (since n-k =0). So idx=2: add 1, sk becomes 1. idx becomes 1. sk>0 and idx >=0: add 1, sk becomes 0. Loop exits. So total added 5. So elements 2 and 1 get an extra 1. So the elements would be 2+2, 1+2, 0+1? Wait, no. Wait, in this example, initial elements are l. Then in the code, after the first loop, ans[2], ans[1], ans[0] each get 1. Then, sk is 5-3=2. Then again, ans[2] and ans[1] get 1 each. So total ans[2] has 2 added, ans[1] has 2 added, ans[0] has 1 added. So in this case, sk is 5: 3+2 =5. So the code distributes as much as possible in rounds.\n\nSo in Fortran, the same approach: each time, start from the highest index (n) and loop through the last k elements, adding 1 until sk is zero.\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop structure is a bit different. Let's think:\n\nWe have to loop while sk >0. For each iteration of the outer loop, start from idx =n (Fortran's last element), and loop down to (n -k +1). For each step, add 1 to ans(idx), decrement sk and idx. Repeat until sk is zero.\n\nBut in the Java code, the inner loop is inside the outer loop. Wait, no, in the Java code, the outer loop is a while (sk>0) loop. Inside that loop, the inner loop is a while (sk>0 && idx >=n-k). So for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop processes the elements once. But in Java, the outer loop is redundant because once the inner loop processes all elements, sk may still be positive. Wait, no. Let me see.\n\nFor example, if sk=4 and k=3. Then, first inner loop: process 3 elements (idx 2,1,0), sk becomes 1. Then the inner loop exits (sk>0 still). Then, outer loop starts again. Inner loop starts idx=2 again. Process idx=2: sk becomes 0. Exit.\n\nSo in Java, the outer loop is necessary to restart the inner loop.\n\nSo in Fortran, how to replicate this? The equivalent would be:\n\nDO WHILE (sk > 0)\n    idx = n\n    DO WHILE (sk > 0 .AND. idx >= (n -k +1))\n        ans(idx) = ans(idx) + 1\n        sk = sk - 1\n        idx = idx - 1\n    END DO\nEND DO\n\nWait, but in Fortran, once the inner loop exits, if sk is still >0, the outer loop will run again. Then the inner loop starts idx from n again. So this should distribute the remaining sk as per the Java code.\n\nYes. So that's the correct approach.\n\nSimilarly for the sAll loop. The Java code's loop is:\n\nwhile (sAll >0) {\n    int idx =0;\n    while (sAll>0 && idx < n -k) {\n        ans[idx++]++;\n        sAll--;\n    }\n}\n\nSo here, idx starts at 0 and increases up to n-k-1 (since idx < n -k). So the first n-k elements. In Fortran, the indexes are 1 to (n -k). So the inner loop in Fortran would be:\n\nDO WHILE (sAll > 0)\n    idx = 1\n    DO WHILE (sAll >0 .AND. idx <= (n -k))\n        ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n        sAll = sAll -1\n        idx = idx +1\n    END DO\nEND DO\n\nWait, but in Java, idx starts at 0 each time. So in Fortran, the inner loop starts at 1 each time. So yes, the same logic.\n\nNow, the adjustments to sAll and sk:\n\nIn Java:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k) * l;\nsk -= k * l;\n\nWait, wait. Wait, initial ans array is filled with l. Then sk is the sum of the first k elements. So in Java, initial sk is k*l. Then the code subtracts k*l from sk, so sk becomes sk - k*l. Similarly, sAll is the sum of all elements: k*l + (n -k)*l = n*l. Then sAll is adjusted by subtracting sk (original sk, which is the sum of the first k elements after initial fill) and (n -k)*l. So the new sAll is sAll_original - (sk + (n -k)*l). \n\nBut I need to check the code.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nans is filled with l. So sum of all elements is n*l. Then:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)*l;\n\nBut sAll is the input parameter, which is supposed to be the total sum of all elements. So after the initial fill, sAll is adjusted to sAll_initial - (sk + (n -k)*l). But sk is the input parameter sk, which is the sum of the first k elements. So after filling ans with l, the sum of the first k elements is k*l. But the input sk is the desired sum of the first k elements. So the code subtracts the initial sum (k*l) from sk, to get the remaining sk that needs to be distributed. Then similarly for sAll.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nInitially, ans is filled with l. So the sum of the first k elements is k*l, and the sum of the remaining (n-k) elements is (n-k)*l. So the total sum is k*l + (n-k)*l = n*l.\n\nBut sAll is the input sum of all elements. So after filling with l, the actual sum is n*l. But the input sAll is supposed to be the desired sum. So the code calculates sAll as sAll_input - (n*l) (since sAll = sAll - (sk + (n-k)*l). Because sk here is the desired sum of the first k elements. Wait, no. Wait, in the code:\n\nAfter filling ans with l, the sum of the first k elements is k*l. But sk is the input parameter sk, which is the desired sum of the first k elements. So the code subtracts k*l from sk, which gives the remaining points that need to be added to the first k elements. Similarly, sAll is the desired total sum. The code subtracts sk (the desired sum of first k) and (n-k)*l (the initial sum of the remaining elements) to get the remaining points to distribute to the other elements.\n\nWait, let's re-express the code steps:\n\nans is filled with l.\n\nThe sum of the first k elements is k*l. So the code wants to adjust these elements to sum to sk. So the remaining points for the first k elements is sk - k*l. Then, the code's first step is sk -= k*l.\n\nSimilarly, the total sum is sk + (n-k)*l. So the remaining points for the entire array is sAll - (sk + (n-k)*l). So the code subtracts that from sAll.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe code's steps after filling ans with l:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n - k) * l;\n\nsk -= k * l;\n\nSo sAll is adjusted by subtracting sk (the original sk, which is the desired sum of the first k elements) and (n -k)*l (the sum of the remaining elements). So the new sAll is the remaining sum to be distributed to the first (n -k) elements. Wait, no. Because the initial sum after filling ans with l is n*l. Then, the code's sAll is being set to sAll_input - (sk + (n -k)*l). That would represent sAll_input - (sum of first k elements (sk) + sum of remaining elements ( (n-k)*l )). Wait, but the initial sum after filling is n*l. But the code's logic is that after setting the ans array to l, the sum of the first k elements is k*l, but the desired sum for those elements is sk. So the code's sAll is adjusted by subtracting sk (the desired sum of the first k) and the sum of the remaining elements ( (n-k)*l ), but that's not correct. Because the desired sum of the first k is sk, the desired sum of the remaining is sAll_input - sk. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is written as follows:\n\nThe total sum of the array must be sAll. The first k elements must sum to sk, and the remaining (n-k) elements sum to sAll - sk. \n\nBut initially, all elements are l, so first k sum to k*l, remaining sum to (n-k)*l. So the code subtracts from sk the initial sum of the first k elements (k*l) to get the remaining points to add to the first k elements. Similarly, the remaining sum for the total array is sAll - (sk + (n-k)*l). Because the sum of all elements after filling is n*l. But the desired sum is sAll. So the code computes the remaining points for the entire array as sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l). Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nOriginal sum after filling with l is n*l. \n\nBut the desired sum is sAll. So the code's sAll variable is adjusted to sAll - n*l. But the code subtracts sk + (n-k)*l. Which is sk (desired sum of first k) plus (n-k)*l (sum of the remaining elements after filling). So the code's sAll variable becomes sAll_input - sk - (n -k)*l. Which would be the total sum that the remaining (n -k) elements need to have beyond their initial l.\n\nBut that's not correct. Because the initial sum of the remaining (n -k) elements is (n -k)*l. The desired sum of those elements is (sAll_input - sk). So the remaining points to add to those elements is (sAll_input - sk) - (n -k)*l. Which is sAll_input - sk - (n -k)*l. So the code's sAll variable after adjustment is exactly that. So sAll becomes the amount to distribute to the (n -k) elements.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nAfter filling the array with l:\n\n- The first k elements need to have a total of sk. So subtract their initial sum (k*l) from sk. The remaining sk is the points to add to them.\n\n- The entire array's sum must be sAll_input. The sum of the first k elements is sk, so the sum of the remaining is sAll_input - sk. Subtract their initial sum ( (n -k)*l ) to get the points to add to the remaining elements. So sAll is set to (sAll_input - sk) - (n -k)*l = sAll_input - sk - (n -k)*l.\n\nThus, the code's steps make sense.\n\nIn Fortran, after filling the array with l, the same adjustments are made:\n\nsAll = sAll - sk - (n - k) * l\nsk = sk - k * l\n\nBut wait, no. The code first adjusts sAll, then adjusts sk. Let me check the Java code:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k) * l;\nsk -= k * l;\n\nSo first, sAll = sAll - sk - (n-k)*l. Then, sk = sk -k*l. \n\nSo in Fortran, the order is the same. So after initializing ans to l, we compute:\n\nsAll = sAll - sk - (n - k) * l\nsk = sk - k * l\n\nNow, need to handle possible negative values? Probably not, since the problem's constraints probably ensure that sk >=k*l and sAll >= sk + (n -k)*l. But in code, the Java code doesn't check, so the Fortran code shouldn't either.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter initializing ans to l:\n\nsAll = sAll - sk - (n - k) * l\nsk = sk - k * l\n\nThen, the loops to distribute sk and sAll.\n\nNow, handling the loops:\n\nFor sk distribution:\n\nLoop while sk >0:\n\n   idx starts at n (Fortran's last element)\n   loop while sk>0 and idx >= (n -k +1)\n      increment ans(idx), decrement sk and idx.\n\nBut in Fortran, the loop structure is:\n\nDO WHILE (sk > 0)\n    idx = n\n    DO WHILE (sk > 0 .AND. idx >= (n -k +1))\n        ans(idx) = ans(idx) + 1\n        sk = sk - 1\n        idx = idx -1\n    END DO\nEND DO\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the DO WHILE loop checks the condition at the top. So in the inner loop, we have to check if idx >= (n -k +1) and sk>0.\n\nFor example, if k is zero, but that's probably not possible since in the problem constraints, k is a positive integer. But code should handle possible edge cases. But given the problem's context, maybe k is between 1 and n.\n\nSimilarly for sAll loop.\n\nThen, the sAll loop:\n\nDO WHILE (sAll > 0)\n    idx =1\n    DO WHILE (sAll >0 .AND. idx <= (n -k))\n        ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n        sAll = sAll -1\n        idx = idx +1\n    END DO\nEND DO\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the Fortran code structure:\n\nProgram:\n\nRead inputs: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk.\n\nAllocate ans array of size n.\n\nSet ans to l.\n\nCompute sAll and sk adjustments.\n\nDistribute sk and sAll.\n\nPrint the ans array.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nprogram codeforces_369_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk, i\n    integer, allocatable :: ans(:)\n    \n    !

To add a new line after the output\nend program codeforces_369_B\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loops need to be properly structured. Also, the code uses 'i' as the loop variable. Also, in the sk distribution loop, the inner loop variable is i. Let's check.\n\nBut in Fortran, the do while loops need to have proper syntax. For example, in the sk distribution loop:\n\ndo while (sk > 0)\n    i = n\n    do while (sk > 0 .and. i >= (n -k +1))\n        ans(i) = ans(i) +1\n        sk = sk -1\n        i = i -1\n    end do\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if n -k +1 is larger than n? For example, if k=0. But according to the problem statement, probably k is at least 1. So the code assumes that.\n\nSimilarly, in the sAll loop:\n\ndo while (sAll > 0)\n    i =1\n    do while (sAll >0 .and. i <= (n -k))\n        ans(i) = ans(i) +1\n        sAll = sAll -1\n        i = i +1\n    end do\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nBut Fortran uses .and. instead of &&. So in the code, the conditions are correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial read, the variables are read in order: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk.\n\nBut in the Java code, the variables are read as n, k, l, r, sAll, sk. So Fortran reads them in the same order.\n\nThen, the code for printing the array. In Java, the elements are printed separated by space, with a trailing space. The Fortran code uses a loop with 'advance='no'' to print each element followed by a space. Then, after the loop, a write(*,*) to add a new line.\n\nBut in Fortran, when using advance='no', subsequent writes continue on the same line. So for example:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') ans(i), ' '\nend do\nwrite(*,*) \n\nThis would print all elements with a space after each, and then a new line. However, the last element will also have a space after it, which may differ from the Java code's output. For example, Java's code outputs \"num + \" \" for each element, leading to a trailing space. So the Fortran code replicates that.\n\nBut in some cases, the problem may require no trailing space. However, in the original Java code, the output includes a trailing space, so the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, check for possible off-by-one errors in the indices.\n\nFor example, when k is 3 and n is 5:\n\nn -k +1 =5-3 +1=3. So the loop runs from i=5 down to 3. Which are the last 3 elements. Correct.\n\nFor the sAll loop, when n-k is 2, i runs from 1 to 2. Which are the first 2 elements. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, k=3. Then n -k +1 =1. So the loop runs from i=3 down to 1. Correct.\n\nYes, the indices are correct.\n\nNow, test with sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nLet's take a case where n=3, k=2, l=1, r=5, sAll=9, sk=5.\n\nInitially, ans is [1,1,1].\n\nAdjustments:\n\nsAll = 9 -5 - (3-2)*1 =9 -5 -1=3.\n\nsk =5 - 2*1=3.\n\nNow, distribute sk=3 to the last 2 elements.\n\nLoop sk>0:\n\nFirst iteration, i=3 (n=3), check i >= 3-2+1=2. So i=3 >=2: yes. ans[3] becomes 2, sk=2. i=2.\n\nsk=2>0, i=2 >=2: yes. ans[2] becomes 2, sk=1. i=1.\n\nNow i=1 is less than 2? Because n-k+1=3-2+1=2. So i=1 is not >=2. So inner loop ends. sk=1>0, so outer loop runs again.\n\ni=3 again. ans[3] becomes 3, sk=0. loop ends.\n\nSo after sk distribution: ans is [1, 2, 3]. sum of last two elements is 2+3=5, which matches sk=5.\n\nThen distribute sAll=3 to first (3-2)=1 element (i=1).\n\nLoop sAll=3:\n\nFirst iteration, i=1. loop runs 3 times:\n\ni=1, sAll=3: ans[1] becomes 2, sAll=2.\n\ni=2 (since i increments after each step?), wait no. Wait, the code in sAll's inner loop:\n\ni starts at 1. Do while sAll>0 and i <=n -k (n-k=1).\n\nIn this case, n-k=1. So i starts at 1 and loops while i <=1.\n\nFirst step:\n\nans[1] +=1 \u2192 2, sAll=2.\n\ni increments to 2. Now, i=2 is not <=1. So inner loop exits.\n\nBut sAll is 2>0. So outer loop runs again.\n\ni starts at 1 again.\n\nans[1] +=1 \u21923, sAll=1.\n\ni increments to 2. Exit inner loop.\n\nsAll=1>0. Outer loop runs again.\n\nans[1] +=1 \u21924, sAll=0.\n\ni increments to 2. Exit inner loop.\n\nNow sAll=0. Exit.\n\nSo the ans array becomes [4, 2,3]. sum is 4+2+3=9. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, k=3, l=2, sAll= 3*5 + 4=19 (assuming sk=5*3=15). Wait, maybe better to take a concrete example.\n\nBut overall, the code seems correct."
