    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The program reads a string, counts the frequency of each character, then checks how many characters have an odd count. Based on that, it prints \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nFirst, in Fortran, I'll need to read the input string. Java uses BufferedReader, but Fortran can read directly using READ statements. Then, the code uses a HashMap to count characters. Fortran doesn't have HashMaps, so I'll have to use an array to track counts for each possible character, maybe using their ASCII values.\n\nSo, the characters are probably in the ASCII range. Let's assume lowercase letters, but maybe uppercase too. The ASCII value for 'a' is 97 and 'z' is 122. So, I can create an array of size 256 to cover all possible ASCII characters. Initialize all counts to zero.\n\nThen, loop through each character in the string, convert to their ASCII index, increment the count in the array.\n\nAfter counting, iterate through the array to count how many characters have odd counts. Then, check the conditions: if oddCount is <=1 or it's odd, print \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nLet's think about Fortran's string handling. In Fortran, strings are fixed-length, so when reading, we need to read into a character variable of sufficient length. Also, trimming leading/trailing spaces might be necessary, but the input is a single line. The Java code reads the entire line, including spaces, so in Fortran, we can read into a variable with a large enough size and then adjust.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the input string.\n2. Initialize an array of size 256 for counts.\n3. Loop over each character in the string, increment the count for each.\n4. Calculate the number of odd counts.\n5. Determine output based on oddCount.\n\nNow, translating each part.\n\nReading input: Use READ(*, '(A)') str. But need to trim trailing newline or spaces. Wait, Fortran's READ will read the entire line into the variable. So assuming the input is a single line, this should work.\n\nDeclare the count array as integer, dimension(256) :: counts = 0.\n\nLoop through each character in the string: In Fortran, strings are 1-based, so loop from 1 to len_trim(str). For each character, get its ASCII value. Wait, but Fortran's ICHAR function returns the ASCII code. So for each position i in the string, c = str(i:i), then index = ICHAR(c), and counts(index) += 1.\n\nThen, after counting, loop through the counts array. For each element, if counts(j) >0 and modulo(counts(j), 2) /=0, increment oddCount.\n\nThen check the conditions: if (oddCount <=1 .or. mod(oddCount, 2) /=0) then print \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, the Java code's condition is if (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0). So in Fortran, that's if (oddCount <=1 .or. mod(oddCount, 2) /=0). Then write 'First' else 'Second'.\n\nNow, handling output. Fortran uses WRITE(*,*) for console output, but that adds spaces. To avoid that, perhaps use format strings. Like WRITE(*, '(A)') 'First'.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nPossible edge cases: empty string? But according to the problem, probably not. Also, case sensitivity: the Java code treats characters as case-sensitive, as the map uses Character. So in Fortran, same, since I'm using ASCII codes.\n\nTesting: For example, if the input is \"abc\", counts are 1 each. oddCount is 3. Then, since 3 is odd, output is \"First\". If input is \"abba\", counts are 2,2. oddCount 0, output \"First\".\n\nWait, let's check the condition. Java code says:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) print First else Second.\n\nSo when oddCount is 0: 0 <=1 is true \u2192 First.\n\nWhen oddCount is 2: 2 is even \u2192 else, so Second.\n\nSo the logic is: if the number of characters with odd counts is 0 or 1, then First. If it's even and more than 1, then Second. If it's odd (like 3,5,...), then First.\n\nNow, Fortran code.\n\nDeclare variables:\n\ncharacter(1000) :: str  ! Assuming max length of input is 1000\ninteger :: counts(0:255) = 0  ! indexes from 0 to 255 for ASCII\ninteger :: i, oddCount, len_str, ascii\ncharacter :: c\n\nRead input:\n\nread(*, '(A)') str\nlen_str = len_trim(str)\n\nLoop over each character:\n\ndo i = 1, len_str\n    c = str(i:i)\n    ascii = ichar(c)\n    counts(ascii) = counts(ascii) + 1\nend do\n\nThen compute oddCount:\n\noddCount = 0\ndo i = 0, 255\n    if (mod(counts(i), 2) /= 0) then\n        oddCount = oddCount + 1\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen check conditions:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 .or. mod(oddCount,2) /=0) then\n    print *, 'First'\nelse\n    print *, 'Second'\nendif\n\nWait, in Fortran, 'print *' adds a space. To avoid that, perhaps use formatted write:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)') 'First'\n\nBut in Fortran, the 'print' statement is simpler. Let me check: when you do print *, 'First', it outputs ' First' with a leading space. To avoid that, use format:\n\nprint '(A)', 'First'\n\nYes, so changing that.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(1000) :: str\n    integer :: counts(0:255) = 0\n    integer :: i, oddCount, len_str, ascii\n    character :: c\n\n    read(*, '(A)') str\n    len_str = len_trim(str)\n\n    do i = 1, len_str\n        c = str(i:i)\n        ascii = ichar(c)\n        counts(ascii) = counts(ascii) + 1\n    end do\n\n    oddCount = 0\n    do i = 0, 255\n        if (mod(counts(i), 2) /= 0) then\n            oddCount = oddCount + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (oddCount <= 1 .or. mod(oddCount, 2) /= 0) then\n        print '(A)', 'First'\n    else\n        print '(A)', 'Second'\n    end if\nend program main\n\nWait, in the first loop, the line counts(ascii) = counts(ascii) +1. But in the code, ascii is computed from ichar(c). That should be correct.\n\nTesting this code. For example, input \"a\", counts for 'a' (ASCII 97) is 1. oddCount is 1 \u2192 print First.\n\nInput \"ab\", counts are 1 and 1. oddCount 2. Since 2 is even and >1 \u2192 condition is (2 <=1) \u2192 false, or (2 mod 2 !=0) \u2192 false. So else clause, print Second.\n\nAnother example: \"aaab\". Counts: a:3, b:1. oddCount is 2 (both 3 and 1 are odd). So condition (2 <=1) no, mod(2,2)=0 \u2192 condition is false. So print Second. But according to Java code, if oddCount is even (2), then the else clause would execute. So code is correct.\n\nAnother example: oddCount is 3. Then mod(3,2) is 1 \u22600 \u2192 condition is true \u2192 print First.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nI think that's the correct translation."
