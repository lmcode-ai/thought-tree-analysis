    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main part is the solve method. It reads an integer t, then reads t integers into an array arr. Then, for each element in arr, it determines some winner based on the current value and the previous winner. The output is either 1 or 2 for each element.\n\nFirst, Fortran has fixed-format or free-format, but I'll probably use free-format here. Let's think about the structure.\n\nIn Java, the code uses a FastReader class for input. Fortran doesn't have classes, but we can handle input with regular read statements. The main thing is reading integers from standard input.\n\nSo, in the main program, the Java code runs solve once. The solve function reads t, then t integers into arr. Then loops through each element, updating prevWinner and printing outputs.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to read the input. Let's see. The first integer is t, then t numbers. So perhaps:\n\nRead *, t\nAllocate the array arr of size t\nRead the t elements.\n\nThen process each element in order.\n\nBut Fortran's I/O can be tricky. For reading multiple integers on the same line or different lines, the code uses a loop. But in the Java code, each element is read via nextInt(), which probably splits on any whitespace. So in Fortran, reading the entire array in one go should work as long as the input is properly formatted.\n\nNow, the logic in the loop. Let's look at the Java code:\n\nFor each element in arr:\n- If the current element is 1, then if prevWinner is 0, set prevWinner to 2.\n- Then, depending on prevWinner being 2 or 0, check if (arr[i] -1) is even. If yes, output 2 and set prevWinner to 2. Else, output 1 and set prevWinner to 1.\n- If prevWinner is not 2 or 0 (so it's 1), then check the same (arr[i]-1) even. If even, output 1 and set prevWinner to 1. Else, output 2 and set to 2.\n\nWait, the initial prevWinner is 0. So for the first iteration, since prevWinner is 0, the code checks if arr[i] is 1. If it is, then prevWinner becomes 2. Then, in the next part, since prevWinner is 2 or 0, compute (arr[i] -1) mod 2. If even, output 2, else 1.\n\nWait, let me parse the code step by step.\n\nThe Java code's solve function:\n\nint t = scan.nextInt();\nint[] arr = new int[t];\nfor (int i=0; i<arr.length; i++) arr[i] = scan.nextInt();\n\nThen prevWinner is 0.\n\nLoop over each element in arr:\n\nif (arr[i] == 1) {\n    if (prevWinner == 0) {\n        prevWinner = 2;\n    }\n}\n\nThen, check if prevWinner is 2 or 0. So after handling the arr[i]==1 case, the code checks the prevWinner.\n\nDepending on that, the logic for choosing the next winner is based on whether (arr[i]-1) is even.\n\nSo, for example, when prevWinner is 2 or 0:\n\nif (arr[i]-1) even: output 2, set prevWinner to 2.\n\nElse: output 1, set to 1.\n\nBut if prevWinner is 1 (so not 2 or 0), then:\n\nif (arr[i]-1) even: output 1, else 2.\n\nHmm. So the logic depends on the previous winner and the current arr[i] value.\n\nNow, in Fortran, I need to replicate this.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead t.\n\nRead t integers into an array.\n\nInitialize prev_winner to 0.\n\nLoop over each element in the array:\n\n   current_value = arr(i)\n\n   if (current_value == 1) then\n\n       if (prev_winner == 0) then\n\n           prev_winner = 2\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\n   if (prev_winner == 2 .or. prev_winner ==0) then\n\n       if (mod(current_value -1, 2) ==0) then\n\n           print 2\n\n           prev_winner =2\n\n       else\n\n           print 1\n\n           prev_winner=1\n\n       end if\n\n   else\n\n       if (mod(current_value-1, 2) ==0) then\n\n           print 1\n\n           prev_winner=1\n\n       else\n\n           print 2\n\n           prev_winner=2\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\nSo, the main challenge is translating the loops and the conditions.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based. So when looping, in Fortran, we'll loop from 1 to t.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, when you read an array, you can read all elements at once if they are provided on the same line or separated by spaces.\n\nFor input, let's consider that the first integer is t, followed by t integers. So in Fortran, the code would:\n\ninteger :: t\n\nread *, t\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n\nallocate(arr(t))\n\nread *, arr\n\nThen loop i from 1 to t.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly. The read *, arr will read t integers, which is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, for printing each result as per the code. The Java code prints each result as it processes each element, so in Fortran, we'll use print statements for each iteration.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran's mod function can be used. mod(a, b) returns a mod b. But note that in Fortran, if a is negative, the result depends on the compiler. But in the Java code, (arr[i]-1) is used. Since arr[i] is input by the user, perhaps the code assumes that arr[i] is positive, so (arr[i]-1) is non-negative, so mod in Fortran would behave the same as in Java.\n\nSo the mod(current_value -1, 2) in Fortran would be equivalent to (current_value -1) % 2 in Java.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nThe Fortran code would look like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: t, i\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n    integer :: prev_winner, current_value\n\n    read *, t\n    allocate(arr(t))\n    read *, arr\n\n    prev_winner = 0\n\n    do i = 1, t\n        current_value = arr(i)\n\n        if (current_value == 1) then\n            if (prev_winner == 0) then\n                prev_winner = 2\n            end if\n        end if\n\n        if (prev_winner == 2 .or. prev_winner == 0) then\n            if (mod(current_value - 1, 2) == 0) then\n                print *, 2\n                prev_winner = 2\n            else\n                print *, 1\n                prev_winner = 1\n            end if\n        else\n            if (mod(current_value - 1, 2) == 0) then\n                print *, 1\n                prev_winner = 1\n            else\n                print *, 2\n                prev_winner = 2\n            end if\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(arr)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the initial prevWinner is 0. Then for each element in arr, process as follows.\n\nYes. So the code should handle that.\n\nTesting a sample input. Let's say the input is:\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nThen the code would process each element.\n\nFirst element is 1. prevWinner is 0.\n\nIn the first part, current_value ==1, and prev_winner is 0. So set prev_winner to 2.\n\nThen check if prev_winner is 2 or 0 (yes, 2). Then current_value-1 is 0. mod 0,2 is 0. So print 2, set prev_winner to 2.\n\nSecond element is 2. current_value=2.\n\nCheck if 2 ==1? No. So the first if block doesn't trigger.\n\nThen check prev_winner is 2. So in the first part.\n\ncurrent_value-1 is 1. mod 1,2 is 1. So else clause: print 1, set prev_winner to 1.\n\nThird element is 3.\n\nCheck if 3 ==1? No.\n\nprev_winner is 1. So enter else part.\n\ncurrent_value-1 is 2. mod 2,2=0. So print 1, set prev_winner to 1.\n\nFourth element is 4.\n\nprev_winner is 1. Else part.\n\ncurrent_value-1 is 3. mod 3,2 is 1. So else: print 2, prev_winner 2.\n\nFifth element is5.\n\nprev_winner is2.\n\ncurrent_value-1 is4. mod4,2=0. So print2, set to 2.\n\nSo output would be:\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nBut I'm not sure. The Java code may have different behavior, but the Fortran code should replicate it.\n\nAnother sample: if the input is t=1, arr[0] =1.\n\nprevWinner starts at 0.\n\ncurrent_value=1: first if triggers, sets prev_winner to 2.\n\nThen check prev_winner is 2. (current_value-1) is 0. mod 0,2=0. Print 2. So output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the Java code.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be correct.\n\nI think this should work. Now, writing the code as per the syntax."
