    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. The program reads a line of input, then checks the last non-space and non-question mark character to see if it's a vowel or 'y'. If it is, it prints \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\nFirst, Fortran uses different input methods. Instead of a Scanner, I'll need to read the input using READ statements. Also, strings in Fortran have fixed lengths unless using allocatable or deferred length, so I should probably declare the string variable with a sufficient length, maybe 100 characters to be safe.\n\nIn the Java code, the loop starts from the end of the string and moves backward until it finds a character that's not a space or '?'. Once found, it converts it to lowercase and checks against vowels and 'y'.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are 1-indexed. So to loop from the end, I need to start from LEN_TRIM(s) and go backwards. Wait, but LEN_TRIM gives the length without trailing spaces. Wait, but in the original code, the Java code checks all characters, including spaces, except trailing ones? Wait no, the Java code reads the entire line, including spaces. For example, if the input is \"abc  ? \", the loop starts from the last index, checks each character, skipping spaces and '?' until it finds a valid character.\n\nSo in Fortran, after reading the string, I need to loop from the end of the string (the actual length, not trimmed) towards the beginning. Wait, but when you read a line in Fortran with READ(*,'(A)'), it might include trailing spaces if the input line is shorter than the declared length. Hmm, but in practice, when you read a line, the variable is filled up to the length of the input line, and the rest are spaces. Wait, no. Wait, if the input line is \"hello\", and the variable is declared as CHARACTER(100) :: s, then s will have 'hello' followed by 95 spaces. So when looping from the end, the code might pick up those trailing spaces. But in the Java code, the original code is using s.length(), which is the actual length of the string (including any trailing spaces that were part of the input). Wait, no. Wait, in Java, when you read a line using nextLine(), it includes all characters up to the newline, excluding the newline itself. So trailing spaces are included in the string. So in the Java code, the loop goes from s.length()-1 down to 0, checking each character.\n\nSo in Fortran, the equivalent would be to loop from the LEN(s) down to 1. But wait, in Fortran, the LEN(s) is the declared length, which is fixed. So if the user inputs a line shorter than that, the rest are filled with spaces. But that's not the same as Java's s.length(). For example, if the user inputs \"abc\", the Java string length is 3, but in Fortran, if s is declared as CHARACTER(100), then LEN(s) is 100, and the actual input would be \"abc\" followed by 97 spaces. So when looping from the end, the code would check the 100th character, which is space, then 99th, etc., until it finds a non-space and non-'?' character.\n\nWait, but the Java code reads the entire line, including any trailing spaces. So for example, if the input line is \"  xyz?  \", then the Java code's s.length() would be 6 (assuming that's how many characters are in the line). So in Fortran, if I read the line into a variable with sufficient length, say 100, then the actual string will have the input characters plus trailing spaces. But the original Java code's loop will check all characters up to the original length. So perhaps in Fortran, after reading the input, I should first trim the trailing spaces, but then again, maybe not. Wait, the original code checks all characters, including trailing spaces. Wait no, the original loop starts at i = length - 1 (which is the last character of the string), and loops backward. But in Java, the length is the actual number of characters in the string. So, in the example \"  a? \", the length would be 4 (assuming the input ends with a space), and the loop checks index 3 down to 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, after reading the input into a variable, we need to loop from the declared length down to 1, checking each character. But if the actual input is shorter than the declared length, the rest are filled with spaces, which would be considered in the loop. However, this could lead to considering trailing spaces added by Fortran as part of the input, which is not the case in Java.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. For example, if the user's input is \"hello?\", which is 6 characters, and in Fortran, we declare the variable as CHARACTER(100) :: s. Then s will be \"hello?\" followed by 94 spaces. The loop would start at 100 and check each, but in the Java code, the loop would check up to index 5 (assuming length 6).\n\nSo this approach would not work. Therefore, in Fortran, after reading the input line, we need to find the actual length of the input line (excluding the padding spaces). How to do that? Well, when you read a line with READ(*, '(A)') s, the variable s will contain all the characters up to the newline, and the rest are filled with spaces. But how to get the actual length? For example, if the input is \"abc\", then in s, the first 3 characters are 'a', 'b', 'c', and the rest are spaces. But the original input line's length is 3. However, in Fortran, there's no direct way to get the length of the input line. So perhaps the approach is to find the position of the last non-space character in the input string.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct either. Because if the input line has trailing spaces, like \"abc   \", then the Java code includes those spaces as part of the string. So in the Java code, the loop would check those spaces. But in Fortran, when we read the line, if the input line is \"abc   \" (with 3 trailing spaces), then in s (declared as, say, 100), the first 6 characters are 'a','b','c',' ', ' ', ' ', and the rest are spaces. So, the Java code's loop would check the last character (index 5, which is space), then 4 (space), then 3 (space), then 2 (c). So in Fortran, the code would loop from 100 down to 1, checking each character. But in this example, after position 6 (since the input line is 6 characters), all are spaces. So the code would loop through positions 100, 99, etc., all spaces, until it hits position 6 (space), then 5 (space), then 4 (space), then 3 (space), then 2 (space?), no. Wait, perhaps the input line is \"abc   \" (length 6), then in Fortran, s(1:6) is 'abc   ', and s(7:100) are spaces. So the code would loop from 100 down to 1, but the first non-space and non-'?' character would be 'c' at position 3. But in the Java code, the loop would check position 5 (the last character of the string), which is space, then 4 (space), then 3 (space), then 2 (c). So in Java, the code would pick 'c', while in Fortran, the code as written would pick 'c' as well. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nIn Java, the original code checks each character starting from the end (s.length()-1), which is the last character. So for input \"abc   \", length is 6. So the loop starts at i=5 (since indexes are 0-based). The characters are: positions 0:a, 1:b, 2:c, 3:space,4:space,5:space. So the loop checks i=5: space \u2192 skip, i=4: space \u2192 skip, i=3: space \u2192 skip, i=2: c \u2192 take that. So the character is 'c'.\n\nIn Fortran, the code would loop from 100 down to 1. The first non-space and non-'?' would be the 'c' at position 3 (since s(3) is space in the input \"abc   \"? Wait, no. Wait, the input line is \"abc   \", which is 6 characters. So in Fortran, s is declared as CHARACTER(100), then s(1:6) is 'a','b','c',' ', ' ', ' ', and s(7:100) are spaces. So when the loop starts at 100, then 99, etc., all those positions are spaces. Then when i=6, s(6) is space. Then i=5: space (s(5) is the 6th character of the input, which is space). i=4: space (s(4) is ' '). i=3: ' ' (input's 4th character?), wait, perhaps I'm mixing up 1-based vs 0-based here.\n\nWait, in Fortran, s is declared as CHARACTER(100), and the input line is \"abc   \" (6 characters). So the first character of s is 'a' (s(1)), s(2) is 'b', s(3) is 'c', s(4) is ' ', s(5) is ' ', s(6) is ' ', and s(7) to s(100) are spaces. So when the loop starts at i=100, then 99, etc., all those are spaces. Then it reaches i=6, which is space. Then i=5 (space), i=4 (space), i=3 (c). So the code would find 'c' as the first non-space and non-? character, which is correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code would loop from len(s) (100) down to 1, checking each character. Once a character is found that is not a space and not a '?', that's the one to check.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input line into a Fortran string variable. Use a sufficiently large length, say 100.\n\n2. Loop from the end of the string (i = LEN(s)) down to 1, check each character.\n\n3. If the character is not a space and not a '?', then convert it to lowercase (but Fortran's case conversion functions may vary; perhaps use IACHAR and check ASCII values).\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert to lowercase, perhaps using the IACHAR function. For example, if the character is uppercase, add 32 to convert to lowercase.\n\nBut the Java code uses Character.toLowerCase(ch), which converts to lowercase. So in the Fortran code, the character needs to be converted to lowercase before checking if it's a vowel or 'y'.\n\nSo after finding the character, convert it to lowercase.\n\nWait, how to handle characters that are already lowercase or uppercase. For example, if the character is 'A', convert to 'a'; if it's 'B', convert to 'b', etc.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can use the SCAN function to check if the character is in a list of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase). But the original code converts to lowercase and checks against lowercase vowels.\n\nSo perhaps in Fortran, after extracting the character, we can convert it to lowercase.\n\nBut how?\n\nOne approach is to check if the character is between 'A' and 'Z', and then add 32 to convert to lowercase. Because in ASCII, 'A' is 65, 'a' is 97, so difference is 32.\n\nSo:\n\nch = s(i:i)\nif (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n    ch = CHAR( IACHAR(ch) + 32 )\nend if\n\nThen check if ch is one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'.\n\nOnce found, print \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFirst, read the input line. In Fortran, you can use:\n\ncharacter(100) :: s\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nBut note that when you read with '(a)', it reads the entire line, but pads with spaces if the input is shorter than the declared length. So s will have the input line, with trailing spaces.\n\nThen loop from len(s) down to 1:\n\ninteger :: i\ncharacter :: ch\nlogical :: found\n\nfound = .false.\ndo i = len(s), 1, -1\n    if (s(i:i) /= ' ' .and. s(i:i) /= '?') then\n        ch = s(i:i)\n        found = .true.\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nIf found is true, process ch. Else, perhaps the string is all spaces and '?', which the Java code would handle by ch being 0 (null character?), but in that case, the Java code would proceed to check. Wait, in Java, if the loop doesn't find any character (all are space or '?'), then ch remains 0, which when converted to lowercase would be 0. Then the code checks if it's a vowel, which it's not, so prints \"NO\".\n\nIn the Fortran code, if found is false, then we can set ch to a space or some non-vowel character. So, after the loop:\n\nif (found) then\n    ! convert to lowercase\n    if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n        ch = char(iachar(ch) + 32)\n    end if\nelse\n    ch = ' '  ! or any non-vowel\nend if\n\nThen check if ch is in the set.\n\nSo the code:\n\nif (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y') then\n    print *, \"YES\"\nelse\n    print *, \"NO\"\nend if\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nPotential code:\n\nprogram codeforces_49_A\n    implicit none\n    character(100) :: s\n    character :: ch\n    integer :: i\n    logical :: found\n\n    read(*, '(a)') s\n\n    found = .false.\n    do i = len(s), 1, -1\n        if (s(i:i) /= ' ' .and. s(i:i) /= '?') then\n            ch = s(i:i)\n            found = .true.\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (found) then\n        if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n            ch = achar(iachar(ch) + 32)\n        end if\n    else\n        ch = ' '  ! default to non-vowel\n    end if\n\n    if (index('aeiouy', ch) > 0) then\n        print *, 'YES'\n    else\n        print *, 'NO'\n    end if\n\nend program codeforces_49_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the index function returns the position of the substring. So index('aeiouy', ch) returns 0 if ch is not found. So checking if it's greater than 0 would determine if the character is present.\n\nAlternatively, using SCAN:\n\nif (scan(ch, 'aeiouy') > 0) then\n\nBut index is perhaps better here.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nFor input \"hello\", the last non-space and non-? is 'o'. Convert to lowercase, check: yes.\n\nInput \"h e y ?\", the last non-space is 'y', which is in the list \u2192 yes.\n\nInput \"abc?\", the last non-? is 'c' (since after ?, there may be spaces. Wait, in the code, the loop checks from the end. So in the input \"abc?\", the string s would have \"abc?\" followed by 96 spaces. The loop starts at 100, which is space, then 99, etc., until i=4 (assuming len(s) is 100). Wait, len(s) is 100, so i starts at 100. s(100) is space. Then i=99, etc., until i=4, s(4) is '?', which is skipped. Then i=3: 'c' \u2192 found. Convert to lowercase 'c', not in vowels \u2192 print NO.\n\nBut according to the original Java code, the input \"abc?\" would have the last character as '?', but the loop skips '?', so the code would look for the previous character, which is 'c'. So same as Fortran code.\n\nAnother test case: input \"Is it a cat?\", the Java code would check the last non-space and non-? character. The input line is \"Is it a cat?\", which ends with '?'. The loop skips the '?', then finds 't' (from 'cat'). 't' is not a vowel \u2192 \"NO\".\n\nIn the Fortran code, same result.\n\nEdge case: all spaces and '?'. Then 'found' is false, ch is set to space, which is not in the list \u2192 print \"NO\".\n\nAnother edge case: input is empty. But in Java, reading a line with only newline gives a string of length 0. Then the loop doesn't execute, ch remains 0. Then the code checks, which is not a vowel \u2192 \"NO\". In Fortran, reading an empty line would result in s being filled with spaces (since it's declared as 100 characters). The loop would check each character (all spaces), found remains false. So ch is set to space, which is not in the list \u2192 \"NO\".\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, possible adjustments: in the code, the variable 's' is declared as character(100). But if the input line is longer than 100 characters, the read statement will truncate it. To handle longer lines, perhaps use a larger length, like 200. But for code submission, perhaps 1000 is safe.\n\nBut the problem likely expects that the input line is within reasonable length, so 100 is sufficient.\n\nSo the final code should be as written above."
