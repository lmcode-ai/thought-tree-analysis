    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads two integers, N and x. Then it reads N integers into a list called sweet. It sorts this list. Then it iterates through the sorted list, subtracting each element from x as long as x remains non-negative. The counter num keeps track of how many elements are subtracted. If after processing all elements x is still positive, it decrements num by 1. Finally, it prints num.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses static typing, so variables must be declared. Let's see:\n\n- N is an integer, x is a long in Java, but in Fortran, maybe integer(kind=8) or just integer, depending on size. Wait, in Java, x is a long, but the input comes from nextInt()? Wait, no: in the Java code, x is read using nextInt(), but stored as a long. Wait, looking again: the code has 'long x = sc.nextInt();' Wait, that's a problem. Wait, no: nextInt() returns an int, but assigns it to a long variable. But in Java, that's okay because int can be promoted to long. But in the problem, maybe x is supposed to be a large number. So in Fortran, perhaps x should be an integer of sufficient size. Let's use integer.\n\nBut the values in the list are read as long as well, but stored in a List<Long>. So in Fortran, perhaps use an array of integers.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read N and x from input.\n\nIn Fortran, reading from standard input can be done with read(*, *). Variables should be declared. So:\n\ninteger :: N, x\nread(*, *) N, x\n\nWait, but in Java, x is a long. Depending on the input size, maybe in Fortran we should use integer(kind=8) for x. But maybe the problem expects x to fit into a regular integer. Let's proceed with regular integers unless there's a reason to use larger types.\n\nNext, read N integers into the list 'sweet', then sort them.\n\nIn Fortran, we can create an array, read N elements into it, then sort.\n\nBut in Java, the list is sorted in ascending order. So in Fortran, we need to sort the array in the same way.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: sweet\nallocate(sweet(N))\ndo i = 1, N\n    read(*, *) sweet(i)\nend do\ncall sort(sweet)\n\nWait, but Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort subroutine. So we'll need to implement a sorting algorithm or use an intrinsic function. Hmm. Alternatively, since the array is one-dimensional, we can use the intrinsic function to sort. Wait, in Fortran, there's no built-in sort function for arrays. So perhaps we need to implement a simple sort, like bubble sort, or use a library. But since the original code uses Collections.sort(), which is a stable sort, perhaps a quicksort or similar. But for the purposes of this problem, since the array is small (as per programming competition constraints), a simple sort will suffice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses a module for sorting. Let me recall that Fortran 2008 introduced the intrinsic module 'iso_fortran_env', but I don't think it includes a sort. So perhaps we need to write a subroutine to sort the array. Let's write a simple bubble sort for this purpose. Or better, use a more efficient method.\n\nAlternatively, since the Java code sorts the list in ascending order, we can sort the Fortran array in the same way. Let's write a subroutine for that.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC027_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, x, i, num\n    integer, allocatable :: sweet(:)\n    read(*, *) N, x\n    allocate(sweet(N))\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*, *) sweet(i)\n    end do\n    call sort_array(sweet)\n    num = 0\n    do i = 1, N\n        if (x - sweet(num+1) >= 0) then\n            x = x - sweet(num+1)\n            num = num + 1\n        else\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n    if (num == N .and. x > 0) then\n        num = num - 1\n    end if\n    print *, num\ncontains\n    subroutine sort_array(arr)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer :: i, j, temp\n        do i = 1, size(arr) - 1\n            do j = i + 1, size(arr)\n                if (arr(i) > arr(j)) then\n                    temp = arr(i)\n                    arr(i) = arr(j)\n                    arr(j) = temp\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end subroutine sort_array\nend program atcoder_AGC027_A\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is from i=0 to N-1, so the array is 0-based. In Fortran, the array is 1-based. So when we sort, the array is sorted in ascending order.\n\nThen, the loop in Java is for (i=0; i<N; i++). In Fortran, the loop is from 1 to N.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop checks x - sweet.get(num) >=0. Since num starts at 0, but in the first iteration, sweet.get(0) is the first element. Then num increments.\n\nIn Fortran, the array is 1-based, so when num is 0, sweet(num+1) is sweet(1), which is correct. So when num starts at 0, but in Fortran, the first element is 1. So the code uses sweet(num+1) as the element. Then, after subtracting, num is incremented by 1. So after the first iteration, num becomes 1, and the next element is sweet(2), etc.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in Java, the initial num is 0. For the first iteration, i=0, but the loop runs N times. But in the code, after each iteration, num is incremented. So the loop runs for N times, but breaks early if x is insufficient. So the Fortran loop should run from 1 to N, and check each element in order.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the loop is:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    if (x - sweet(num+1) >= 0) then\n        x = x - sweet(num+1)\n        num = num + 1\n    else\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but the loop variable i is not used. So perhaps we can just loop from 1 to N and break when the condition is not met. But in Fortran, a do loop with an exit would work. Alternatively, use a while loop, but Fortran's do loop can have an exit.\n\nSo the loop is correct.\n\nAfter processing all elements (i.e., when num == N), but if x is still positive, we subtract 1 from num. That's handled in the Java code.\n\nIn Fortran, if (num == N .and. x > 0) then num = num -1.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, the sorting subroutine. The current implementation is a bubble sort, which is O(n^2), but for programming competition purposes, if N is up to 1e5, this would be too slow, but the original Java code uses a sort which is O(n log n). However, given that the original code uses a list and sorts it, perhaps the problem expects N to be manageable. So the bubble sort might not be efficient, but perhaps in the context of the problem, N is small.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better sorting algorithm is needed. But since the user is asking to translate the code as is, perhaps the bubble sort is acceptable here.\n\nBut wait, the Java code uses Collections.sort, which for a List<Long> is a modified mergesort. So the original code's sorting is O(n log n), so using a bubble sort in Fortran would be O(n^2), which is not acceptable for large N. So perhaps the translation should use a more efficient sort.\n\nBut how to implement that in Fortran?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fortran code can use an intrinsic sort function. But I don't recall Fortran having a built-in sort. So perhaps the user is expected to implement a quicksort.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the Java code's logic is followed, and assume that the sorting is done correctly. So for the purposes of the code, the bubble sort is sufficient for small N, but not for larger. However, the problem may have test cases with small N, so the code will pass.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let's think.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after reading the list, it's sorted in ascending order. So in Fortran, the array must be sorted in ascending order. So the sorting subroutine must arrange the array from smallest to largest. The current bubble sort implementation does this by swapping elements when arr(i) > arr(j), which for i starting from 1 and j from i+1, the inner loop ensures that the smallest elements are moved to the front. Wait, the current code for the bubble sort is actually a selection sort. Let me see:\n\nThe outer loop i from 1 to size(arr)-1. The inner loop j from i+1 to size(arr). For each j, if arr(i) is greater than arr(j), swap them. So after each i iteration, the smallest element in the remaining part is moved to position i. Wait no, because after swapping, arr(i) could still be larger than other elements. Wait, for example, if i=1, j runs from 2 to N. For each j, if arr(1) > arr(j), swap them. So after this, arr(1) will be the smallest element. Then i=2, j runs from 3 to N. For each j, if arr(2) > arr(j), swap. So arr(2) becomes the next smallest. So this is a selection sort, which has O(n^2) time. So for the code, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut for the purposes of the translation, perhaps the user wants a correct sorting, regardless of the method. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the list is zero-based, while in Fortran it's one-based. So when the code in Java accesses sweet.get(num), in Fortran it's sweet(num+1) when num starts at 0. Wait, no.\n\nWait, in Java, the loop starts with num=0, and in the first iteration, checks x - sweet.get(num) (which is the first element). Then subtracts x, increments num. So in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the first element is sweet(1). So in Fortran, the code should start with num=0, then in the loop, check x - sweet(num+1). Because when num is 0, sweet(num+1) is sweet(1), which is correct. Then, after subtracting, num becomes 1. So the next element is sweet(2). So the code is correct.\n\nYes, that part is handled correctly.\n\nSo the code as written should work.\n\nNow, testing a sample input. Let's take the sample input from the original problem. For example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 70\n\n20 30 10\n\nAfter sorting: 10, 20, 30. The sum is 10 +20 =30, leaving 70-30=40. Then 30 is subtracted, 40-30=10. Then num becomes 3. But x is 10>0. So since num equals N (3), we subtract 1, resulting in 2.\n\nWait, wait the original code's logic: after processing all elements (num ==N) and x>0, subtract 1. So in this case, after adding all three elements (sum 60), x was 70. 70-60=10>0. So num is 3, and x is 10>0. So subtract 1 to get 2.\n\nBut wait, the sample input for AGC027 A is likely different. Let me check the original problem's sample input. But since I can't access external resources, perhaps I can think of another example.\n\nAnother example:\n\nN=3, x=50\n\nsweet = [20, 20, 20]. sorted is same.\n\nLoop:\n\nx starts at 50.\n\nFirst element: 20. 50-20 >=0 \u2192 x=30, num=1.\n\nSecond element: 20. 30-20=10 \u22650 \u2192 x=10, num=2.\n\nThird element: 20. 10-20 <0 \u2192 break. So num is 2. Then check if num ==3 (no), so output 2.\n\nBut if x=60, then after three elements, x=60-60=0. So num=3. x is not >0. So output 3.\n\nAnother case: N=3, x=70, elements 10,20,30. sum is 60. x becomes 10. num is 3. So 3 ==N and x>0 \u2192 num becomes 2. Output is 2.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nSo the Fortran code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nAnother possible issue is the data types. In Java, x is a long, but in Fortran, it's an integer. For programming competition problems, if the sum of all elements exceeds 2^31-1, then using 32-bit integers would overflow. But in Fortran, if we use integer(kind=8) for x and the sweet array, that would handle larger numbers. However, the original code uses Java's long, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, to match this, perhaps we need to use 8-byte integers.\n\nSo, perhaps variables x and sweet should be integer(kind=8). Let me adjust that.\n\nIn Fortran, the kind parameter for 8-byte integers can vary. Some compilers use kind=8, others kind=8. So assuming that we can use integer(kind=8).\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC027_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N\n    integer(kind=8) :: x  ! to match Java's long\n    integer :: i, num\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: sweet(:)\n    read(*, *) N, x\n    allocate(sweet(N))\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*, *) sweet(i)\n    end do\n    call sort_array(sweet)\n    num = 0\n    do i = 1, N\n        if (x - sweet(num+1) >= 0) then\n            x = x - sweet(num+1)\n            num = num + 1\n        else\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n    if (num == N .and. x > 0) then\n        num = num - 1\n    end if\n    print *, num\ncontains\n    subroutine sort_array(arr)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer :: i, j\n        integer(kind=8) :: temp\n        do i = 1, size(arr) - 1\n            do j = i + 1, size(arr)\n                if (arr(i) > arr(j)) then\n                    temp = arr(i)\n                    arr(i) = arr(j)\n                    arr(j) = temp\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end subroutine sort_array\nend program atcoder_AGC027_A\n\nThis way, x and the elements of sweet are 8-byte integers, which matches Java's long.\n\nBut how does Fortran handle reading integers into 8-byte variables? The read statement should work as long as the input numbers are within the representable range.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the original Java code, x is initialized as sc.nextLong()? No, wait, the Java code has:\n\nlong x = sc.nextInt();\n\nWait, that's a mistake in the original code. Because sc.nextInt() returns an int, which is then stored in a long. But if the input is a large number that exceeds the int's range (up to 2^31-1), this would cause incorrect values. However, in the problem statement, perhaps x is intended to be up to 1e18, which would require using nextLong().\n\nBut the original Java code uses nextInt() for x, which is wrong. But maybe that's a typo in the original code. However, in the problem statement, perhaps x is small enough to fit in an int. But in any case, the Fortran code uses 8-byte integers for x and the sweet array, which is correct if the original problem intended to use long (as per the Java code's declaration of x as long). So the Fortran code uses the correct data types.\n\nSo, the final code uses 8-byte integers for x and the sweet array to avoid overflow issues.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java code's logic, including data types and algorithm steps."
