Let's look at the original code step by step.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n from the input, then reads n integers into an array. The calculation starts with the first element plus 1, then for each subsequent element, it adds the absolute difference between the current and previous element plus 2. Finally, it prints the total.\n\nSo in Fortran, I'll need to replicate this logic. Let's think about how to structure this.\n\nReading input: In Java, they use Scanner. In Fortran, we'll read from standard input using READ statements. The first input is the integer n. Then we read n integers into an array.\n\nAllocating the array: Since n is variable, we need to use an allocatable array in Fortran. So declare it as integer, allocatable :: arr(:), and then allocate(arr(n)) after reading n.\n\nThe initial value of ans is arr(1) + 1. Then loop from 2 to n, adding abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1)) + 2 each time.\n\nFortran uses 1-based indexing by default, which matches the loop here. So the loop in Java starts at i=1 (which is the second element in 0-based), but in Fortran, the loop will start at i=2, which is the correct position.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n, allocate the array, read the array elements.\n\nInitialize ans with arr(1) + 1.\n\nLoop from i=2 to n:\n\nans = ans + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1)) + 2\n\nFinally, print ans.\n\nWait, but in Java, the first element is arr[0], and in Fortran, it's arr(1). So when the Java code starts with arr[0], in Fortran it's arr(1). That part is okay.\n\nSo the code structure in Fortran would be:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i\n  integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n  integer :: ans\n\n  read(*,*) n\n  allocate(arr(n))\n  do i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) arr(i)\n  end do\n\n  ans = arr(1) + 1\n\n  do i = 2, n\n    ans = ans + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1)) + 2\n  end do\n\n  print*, ans\n\n  deallocate(arr)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read from standard input, each read statement reads a line unless you specify a format. For example, if the input is provided as a single line with n followed by the array elements, or each on separate lines?\n\nIn the Java code, the scanner reads tokens, so it doesn't care about lines. So the Fortran code should read the same way. Using list-directed input (read(*, *)) should handle that, as it skips whitespace and reads the next available integer.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting with sample input: Let's say input is:\n\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nJava code's ans is 1 +1 =2, then for each next element (2,3,4,5):\n\nBetween 1 and 2: |2-1|=1, +2 \u21923.

Then 4 steps (i=1 to 4, since arr length is 5). Each step adds 3, 4 steps \u2192 2 +4*3=14. Correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should produce the same result.\n\nAnother test case: if n=1. Then ans is arr(1)+1. Because the loop from 2 to n doesn't run. So for input 1 followed by 5, output is 6. Which matches Java code.\n\nSo the code seems correct. I need to make sure that all variables are properly declared. Implicit none is used to catch typos. All variables are integers. Allocate the array, read into it, then compute ans.\n\nYes, that should do it."
