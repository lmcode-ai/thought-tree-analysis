    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to convert this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. So, the program reads an integer n, then reads n integers into an array. It sorts the array, then checks if every element in the array is divisible by the smallest element (which is the first element after sorting). If all are divisible, it prints the smallest element; otherwise, it prints -1.\n\nFirst, I need to replicate the input part. In Fortran, reading inputs can be done with READ statements. So, read n, then allocate an array of size n, then read n integers into it.\n\nNext, sorting the array. Java uses Arrays.sort, but Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function. Wait, actually, Fortran has some intrinsic procedures for sorting. Let me recall. Oh right, there's a subroutine called SORT from some libraries, but maybe I need to implement a simple sort here. Alternatively, maybe use the intrinsic minloc and swap elements. Hmm. Alternatively, use the fact that after sorting, the first element is the minimum, but wait no\u2014because the array is sorted in ascending order. So after sorting, the first element is the minimum, but in the Java code, after sorting, the array is in ascending order. So the code takes the first element as min. Wait, but in Java, Arrays.sort sorts in ascending order. So in the code, min is a[0], which is the first element after sorting.\n\nWait, in the code, after sorting, min is set to a[0], which is the smallest element. Then, for each value in the array, check if value % min !=0. But since the array is sorted, all elements after the first are >= min. But if any of them is not divisible by min, then output -1. Otherwise, output min.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read array a of size n.\n3. Sort a in ascending order.\n4. min = a(1) (since Fortran uses 1-based indexing).\n5. For each element in a, check if mod(element, min) is not zero. If any, print -1.\n6. Else, print min.\n\nNow, the challenge is to sort the array in Fortran. How to do that. Well, in Fortran, one can use the intrinsic subroutine sort, but I need to check. Wait, no, Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function. Oh right, that's correct. So I need to implement a sorting algorithm here. The easiest might be a bubble sort, but for small n (as in programming problems), that's acceptable. Alternatively, use a simple sort. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the minval and minloc functions to build a sorted array. For example, for each position i from 1 to n, find the i-th smallest element. That might be inefficient, but for code translation purposes, perhaps acceptable.\n\nWait, but the original code sorts the array. So in Fortran, I need to sort the array in ascending order.\n\nLet me think of a way to implement this. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read n. Then read the array.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n\nread(*,*) n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\nallocate(a(n))\nread(*,*) a\n\nThen, sort the array. Let's implement a simple bubble sort. The code would look something like:\n\ndo i = 1, n-1\n    do j = i+1, n\n        if (a(i) > a(j)) then\n            temp = a(i)\n            a(i) = a(j)\n            a(j) = temp\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\n\nWait, that's actually a selection sort, not bubble sort. Because for each i, it compares with all j > i, and swaps if a[i] is larger. This would sort the array in ascending order. Let me test with a small array. Suppose the array is 3,1,2. The first iteration i=1, j runs from 2 to 3.\n\nj=2: a(1)=3 and a(2)=1 \u2192 swap \u2192 a becomes [1,3,2].\n\nj=3: a(1)=1 and a(3)=2 \u2192 no swap.\n\ni=2, j=3: a(2)=3 and a(3)=2 \u2192 swap \u2192 array becomes [1,2,3]. So yes, that works. So this is a selection sort implementation. So this would sort the array in ascending order.\n\nSo the sorting code would be:\n\ndo i = 1, n-1\n    do j = i+1, n\n        if (a(i) > a(j)) then\n            temp = a(i)\n            a(i) = a(j)\n            a(j) = temp\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\n\nOnce the array is sorted, min is a(1). Then loop through all elements to check mod.\n\nIn Fortran, the modulus function is mod. So for each element in a:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    if (mod(a(i), min) /= 0) then\n        print *, -1\n        stop\n    end if\nend do\n\nIf all pass, then print min.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram codeforces_299_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, j, temp, min_val\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n    \n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(a(n))\n    read(*,*) a\n    \n    ! Sort the array in ascending order using selection sort\n    do i = 1, n-1\n        do j = i+1, n\n            if (a(i) > a(j)) then\n                temp = a(i)\n                a(i) = a(j)\n                a(j) = temp\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n    \n    min_val = a(1)\n    \n    do i = 1, n\n        if (mod(a(i), min_val) /= 0) then\n            print *, -1\n            stop\n        end if\n    end do\n    \n    print *, min_val\nend program codeforces_299_A\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the array is sorted with Arrays.sort(a), which for integers sorts in ascending order. The Fortran code here uses selection sort to sort in ascending order. So that's equivalent.\n\nBut in the Java code, after sorting, min is the first element, which is the smallest. Then, for all elements, check if they are divisible by min. If yes, output min; else, -1.\n\nSo the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nTesting the code with sample input.\n\nFor example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n2 2 2\n\nAfter sorting: 2 2 2. min is 2. All elements divisible by 2. Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n3 2 6\n\nAfter sorting: 2,3,6. min is 2. Check 2%2=0, 3%2=1 \u2192 not zero. So output -1.\n\nSample Input 3:\n4\n5 10 15 20\n\nSorted: 5,10,15,20. All divisible by 5. Output 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n- Fortran uses 1-based indexing. So in the code, after sorting, a(1) is the first element. Correct.\n\n- The modulus function in Fortran is mod(a, p), which returns the remainder. So mod(a(i), min_val) should be correct.\n\n- The stop statement in Fortran exits the program, similar to return in Java's main.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
