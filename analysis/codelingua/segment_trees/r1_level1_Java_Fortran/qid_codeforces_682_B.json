    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java code reads an integer n from input, then reads n integers into a list. It sorts the list and then processes each element to compute a value c. The logic for c is that for each element in the sorted list, if the element is greater than or equal to the current c, then c increments by 1. Finally, it prints c.\n\nSo the main steps are: read input, sort the list, process the sorted list to compute c, output c.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about each part.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, reading input. The Java code uses Scanner to read integers. In Fortran, I'll use read statements. Since we need to read n and then n integers, I'll need to read them into an array.\n\nFor the array, in Java it's an ArrayList which is dynamically sized. In Fortran, we can allocate an array with size n once n is read. So after reading n, allocate an integer array of size n, then read n values into it.\n\nThen sorting the array. Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function like Java's Collections.sort, so I'll need to implement a sorting algorithm. The easiest might be a simple bubble sort, but for efficiency, maybe a better algorithm? But given that n could be up to whatever (the problem isn't specified), but for code submission purposes, maybe a simple sort is sufficient. Alternatively, use the built-in functions if possible. Wait, Fortran 90 and later have some intrinsic functions for array manipulation. For sorting, maybe we can use the intrinsic function. Let me check: Fortran has a sort function? Hmm, I'm not sure. Wait, in Fortran, there's no built-in sort function in the standard libraries. So I'll have to implement a sort. Let's go with a simple bubble sort for the sake of example, although it's not the most efficient. Alternatively, maybe a quick sort implementation. But given the time, bubble sort is easier to code.\n\nBut wait, the original Java code sorts in ascending order, so we need the Fortran array sorted in the same way.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate array of size n.\n\nRead n integers into the array.\n\nSort the array in ascending order.\n\nCompute c starting at 1, iterate through the sorted array. For each element, if element >= c, then c increases by 1.\n\nFinally, print c.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFortran programs start with program name, then variable declarations. Let's name the program something like 'main' or 'code'.\n\nVariables needed:\n\ninteger :: n, c, i\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: list\n\nThen read n from input.\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nThen allocate list(n)\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    read(*,*) list(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen sort the list. Let's implement a simple bubble sort. Or maybe use a better approach. Alternatively, use the intrinsic function if possible. Wait, Fortran 2003 introduced some array operations, but sorting isn't part of the standard. So we need to implement a sort.\n\nLet me code a simple bubble sort.\n\nsubroutine sort(arr, n)\n\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n    integer :: i, j, temp\n\n    do i = 1, n-1\n\n        do j = 1, n-i\n\n            if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n\n                temp = arr(j)\n\n                arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n\n                arr(j+1) = temp\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n    end do\n\nend subroutine sort\n\nBut this is for an array of size n. So in the main program, after reading the list, call this subroutine.\n\nThen process the sorted list to compute c.\n\nInitialize c to 1.\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    if (list(i) >= c) then\n\n        c = c + 1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen print c.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read input, each read statement typically reads from a line. However, in programming competition settings, inputs are often space-separated. So when reading n, then reading n integers, the code may need to read all in one line or multiple lines. But the Fortran read(*,*) will handle this, as it skips over whitespace and line breaks.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nProgram:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, c\n\n    integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    allocate(list(n))\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) list(i)\n\n    end do\n\n    call sort(list, n)\n\n    c = 1\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        if (list(i) >= c) then\n\n            c = c + 1\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    print *, c\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine sort(arr, n)\n\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n        integer :: i, j, temp\n\n        do i = 1, n-1\n\n            do j = 1, n-i\n\n                if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n\n                    temp = arr(j)\n\n                    arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n\n                    arr(j+1) = temp\n\n                end if\n\n            end do\n\n        end do\n\n    end subroutine sort\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the way you pass arrays to subroutines can be a bit different. If the array is allocatable, but in the subroutine, the dummy argument is assumed shape. Hmm, but in this case, the list is declared as allocatable in the main program, and passed to the sort subroutine as arr(n), which is explicit size. That's acceptable as long as n is the same as the allocated size.\n\nWait, when you call sort(list, n), the list is an array of size n. The subroutine's dummy argument arr is declared as arr(n), which is correct. So that should work.\n\nBut perhaps, for better practice, we can write the subroutine to take an array of any size, using assumed-shape, but then how to handle loops. Alternatively, use the explicit size as we did.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting it with sample input.\n\nFor example, in the original Java code, if the input is:\n\n5\n\n1 3 2 3 4\n\nThen sorted list is 1,2,3,3,4.\n\nProcessing:\n\nc starts at 1.\n\n1 >=1 \u2192 c=2.\n\n2 >=2 \u2192 c=3.\n\n3 >=3 \u2192 c=4.\n\n3 <4 \u2192 no change.\n\n4 >=4 \u2192 c=5.\n\nSo output is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: if all elements are 1. Let's say n=3, elements 1,1,1.\n\nProcessing:\n\nsorted list is [1,1,1].\n\nc starts at 1.\n\n1 >=1 \u2192 c=2.\n\n1 <2 \u2192 no change.\n\n1 <2 \u2192 no change.\n\nFinal c is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nBut wait, the bubble sort implementation in Fortran: the loops are from 1 to n-1 for i, and j from 1 to n-i. So each pass pushes the largest element to the end. That's correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
