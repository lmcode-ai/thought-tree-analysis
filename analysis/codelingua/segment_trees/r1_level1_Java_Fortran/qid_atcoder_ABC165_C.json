Then when accessing the list, which is 1-based in Fortran, the indices would need to be a[i]+1 and b[i]+1. That makes sense. So during the input phase in Fortran, read a and b, then subtract 1 (as in Java). Then when checking list(a[i]+1) and list(b[i]+1), because in Fortran, the list starts at 1. For example, if the list in Fortran is (1, 2, 3), then a[i] = 0 would refer to the first element, which is list(1). So yes, a[i]+1 is the index. So the first step is to handle the input correctly.",

So when the list is empty (k=0), the first element can be 1 to m. Then each subsequent element is >= the previous. So in the Fortran code, the initial call is with list being an array of n elements, but k=0. So the first element is placed in position 1 (since k+1 = 1). But in Fortran, array indices start at 1. So the list is list(1), list(2), ..., list(n). So the initial call would be to dfs(list, 0), and then in the first iteration, k=0, start_num is 1, loop from 1 to m, setting list(1) to next_num, then call dfs with k=1. Then, when k=1, start_num is list(1), loop from list(1) to m, set list(2), etc. This seems correct. Now, the next step is to compute the score when the list is complete (k == n). So in the compute_score subroutine, we need to loop through all q conditions and compute the sum of d[i] where list(b[i]+1) - list(a[i]+1) == c[i].",

For example, if the problem's input is a_i=1 and b_i=2, then after subtraction, a(i)=0, b(i)=1, which are the 0-based indices. Then, during compute_score:\n\nsum = 0\ndo i = 1, q\n    if (list(b(i)+1) - list(a(i)+1) == c(i)) then\n        sum = sum + d(i)\n    end if\nend do\n\nSo the sum is computed correctly.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first I should understand what the Java code is doing. Let me read through it.\n\nThe Java code is for a problem where they generate all possible sequences of numbers under certain constraints and calculate a maximum score based on some conditions. The main method reads input values n, m, q, and then q quadruples of a, b, c, d. Then it calls a depth-first search (dfs) function to generate sequences and compute the maximum score.\n\nThe dfs function recursively builds a list of integers. When the list reaches size n, it calculates a score by checking each of the q conditions. The conditions are based on the elements at positions a[i] and b[i] in the list, and if their difference equals c[i], it adds d[i] to the score. The maximum score is tracked in the ans variable.\n\nSo, the key parts are handling recursion in Fortran, which doesn't support recursion natively in older standards, but maybe I can simulate it with a stack or use a different approach. Wait, but Fortran 90 and later allow recursion if the function is declared as recursive. Oh right, so maybe I can use a recursive subroutine here.\n\nWait, the original Java code uses an ArrayList for the list, which is modified during the recursion. In Fortran, we can pass arrays as arguments, but handling dynamic arrays might be tricky. Alternatively, since the list's maximum size is n (given as input, up to maybe 10 or so?), we can preallocate an array and track its current length.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read input values n, m, q.\n2. Read q lines of a, b, c, d (but in Java, a and b are adjusted by -1 because of 0-based indexing. Fortran uses 1-based by default, so maybe the adjustment is different. Wait, the original code subtracts 1 from a and b. So in Fortran, if the input is 1-based indices for a and b, then after subtracting 1, they become 0-based. But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. Wait, no. Wait, the Java code stores a, b as indexes into the list (which is 0-based). So when translated to Fortran, since arrays are 1-based by default, the adjustment would need to be different. For example, if the input is a[i] as 1-based in the problem statement, then Java subtracts 1 to make it 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can read the input as is, and subtract 1 to get the same effect. Wait, but the problem statement's input might be 1-based for a and b. Let me see. The original Java code uses a[i] and b[i] as indices into the list. So if the input is given as a and b (1-based in the problem), then the code converts them to 0-based by subtracting 1. So in Fortran, when we read a and b, we need to subtract 1 to get 0-based indices. Wait, but in Fortran, if we have an array, say list(1..n), then a[i] and b[i] would need to be adjusted to 1-based. Hmm, this part might require careful handling.\n\nWait, let's think. In the Java code, when a[i] is read as 1-based (from the problem's input), then subtract 1 to get 0-based index. So for example, if the problem's input for a[i] is 1, then in Java, it's stored as 0, and when accessing list.get(a[i]), it's the first element. In Fortran, the list would be 1-based. So when reading a[i] from input, subtract 1 (to make it 0-based as in Java) and then add 1 again? Wait, no. Wait, the original code uses list.get(b[i]) - list.get(a[i]) == c[i]. So in Java, a[i] and b[i] are indexes starting at 0. So in Fortran, the array will start at 1, so if the original problem's a[i] and b[i] are 1-based, then in Java they are adjusted to 0-based. So in Fortran, when we read the input, we need to subtract 1 to get 0-based indexes, then when accessing the array elements, those indexes (0-based) would correspond to 1-based in Fortran. Wait, that can't be. Let me make this concrete.\n\nSuppose the problem's input for a[i] is 1 (meaning the first element in the list). In Java, after subtracting 1, a[i] becomes 0. So when list is [x0, x1, x2, ... xn-1], then list.get(a[i]) is x0. So in Fortran, the list is an array starting at 1. So if the original input a[i] is 1 (1-based), then in Fortran, after reading, we subtract 1 (so a[i] becomes 0), but then in Fortran, the list starts at index 1. So to get the same element, we need to use a[i] +1 as the index. Wait, no. Because in Java, the list's indices are 0-based. So for example, in Java, the first element is list.get(0). In Fortran, the same list would be list(1), list(2), etc. So when the Java code uses a[i] as 0-based (after subtracting 1 from the input), the equivalent in Fortran would be a[i] +1. Because a[i] in Java is 0-based, and in Fortran the array is 1-based. So during the calculation of the score, when checking list(b[i]) - list(a[i]) == c[i], in Fortran, the indexes would be a[i]+1 and b[i]+1. Wait, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the input phase, we can read the a and b values and adjust them to 0-based (as in the Java code), but then when accessing the list array in Fortran, which is 1-based, we need to add 1 to the indices. For example, if a[i] is 0 (Java index), then in Fortran's array, it's index 1. So in the Fortran code, for each condition i, we check if list(b_i +1) - list(a_i +1) == c_i. Hmm, but wait, in the Java code, a and b are stored as 0-based. So when stored in Fortran, if the input is the same as in Java (but the problem's input is 1-based for a and b), then in Fortran, a[i] and b[i] would be 0-based. Then when accessing the list, which is 1-based in Fortran, the indices would need to be a[i]+1 and b[i]+1. That makes sense.\n\nSo during the input phase in Fortran, read a and b, then subtract 1 (as in Java). Then when checking list(a[i]+1) and list(b[i]+1), because in Fortran, the list starts at 1. For example, if the list in Fortran is (1, 2, 3), then a[i] = 0 would refer to the first element, which is list(1). So yes, a[i]+1 is the index.\n\nSo the first step is to handle the input correctly.\n\nNext, the main part is the recursive DFS function. The Java code starts with an empty list, and builds up the list by adding numbers. Each new number must be >= the previous one. For example, if the list is empty, start adding numbers from 1 to m. Otherwise, the next number is >= the last one in the list, up to m.\n\nIn Fortran, since recursion is possible with the recursive keyword, but handling arrays that are modified during recursion can be done by passing them as arguments. However, in Fortran, when you pass an array to a subroutine, it's passed by reference, so if you modify it, the changes are seen in the caller. But in the Java code, the ArrayList is modified (add and remove), which is handled via backtracking. So in Fortran, we can simulate this by having the current list as an array that's modified, and when backtracking, we reset the value.\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, the list can be represented as an array of size n, and a parameter indicating the current length. For example, we have an array current_list(1:n), and a variable current_length. At each step, when current_length is less than n, we generate the next element starting from the previous element (or 1 if current_length is 0) up to m, and proceed recursively.\n\nAlternatively, since the list must be non-decreasing, each next element is >= the previous one. So the list is a non-decreasing sequence of length n, with elements between 1 and m.\n\nBut generating all possible non-decreasing sequences can be done via backtracking, as in the Java code.\n\nSo in Fortran, the DFS function will need to track the current list, and the current position. Wait, but the Java code builds the list incrementally. Each recursive call adds a new element. So in Fortran, we can have a subroutine that takes the current list (as an array) and the current length (k), and for each possible next element (from the last element in the list up to m), appends it and calls the subroutine recursively.\n\nBut since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays in the same way as Java's ArrayList, we can represent the current list as an array of size n, and track the current position. For example, the list can be an array of size n, and we use the first k elements as the current list. So when k is 0, the list is empty, and we add elements starting from 1. When k is 1, we add elements starting from the first element (current_list(1)) up to m, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when the list is not empty, the next element starts from the last element of the list. So for example, if the list is [1, 3], the next element can be 3,4,...m. So in Fortran, when building the list step by step, each step appends a new element >= the previous one.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Have a subroutine that builds the list step by step.\n\n- For each step, generate the next possible element (starting from the last element in the list, or 1 if the list is empty), and add it to the list, then call the subroutine recursively.\n\nBut in Fortran, passing the current state (the list and its current length) would need to be handled. However, since each recursive call is a separate instance, perhaps we can pass the current list as an array and the current length as an integer.\n\nWait, but arrays in Fortran are passed by reference. So if we modify the array in the callee, the caller's array is modified. But in the Java code, after adding an element and doing the recursive call, the element is removed (backtracking). So in Fortran, we need to handle this similarly. So when the recursive call returns, we need to reset the array's element. But since the array is of fixed size, perhaps each recursive call uses a copy of the array up to the current length. Wait, but that's inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, since each step appends an element to the list, and the list is built incrementally, perhaps the current length can be tracked, and when adding a new element, we place it at position k+1, and proceed, then upon return, we don't need to reset it because the next iteration will overwrite it. Hmm.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the current list has k elements. For each possible next value (starting from the last element or 1), we set the (k+1)-th element to that value, increment the current length, and call the subroutine. Then, after returning from the subroutine, we decrement the current length and proceed to the next possible value.\n\nWait, but this requires tracking the current length. So maybe in the Fortran code, the current list is an array of size n, and a parameter (like k) that indicates how many elements are currently in use.\n\nSo, the DFS subroutine would have parameters like:\n\n- list: integer array of size n\n\n- k: integer, current length (number of elements in list)\n\nAnd the subroutine would proceed as follows:\n\nIf k == n, compute the score and update ans if necessary.\n\nElse:\n\nIf k ==0: possible next elements are 1 to m.\n\nElse: next elements are from list(k) to m.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when the list is not empty, the next element starts from the last element. So for k>0, the next element can be list(k) (the last element) up to m.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, for each possible next element from the last element (if k>0) or 1 (if k=0) up to m, we set list(k+1) to that value and call dfs(list, k+1).\n\nBut how to handle backtracking? Since in Fortran, the array is passed by reference, when we modify list(k+1), the caller's array is modified. So after returning from the recursive call, the next iteration will overwrite list(k+1) with the next value. So that's okay. No need to reset it because in each iteration of the loop, we are setting the next value.\n\nSo for example:\n\nsubroutine dfs(list, k)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: list(n)\n    integer, intent(in) :: k\n    integer :: next_num, i\n\n    if (k == n) then\n        ! compute score\n        call compute_score(list)\n        return\n    end if\n\n    if (k == 0) then\n        start_num = 1\n    else\n        start_num = list(k)\n    end if\n\n    do next_num = start_num, m\n        list(k+1) = next_num\n        call dfs(list, k+1)\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the list is built incrementally. So when the list is empty (k=0), the first element can be 1 to m. Then each subsequent element is >= the previous.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the initial call is with list being an array of n elements, but k=0. So the first element is placed in position 1 (since k+1 = 1).\n\nBut in Fortran, array indices start at 1. So the list is list(1), list(2), ..., list(n).\n\nSo the initial call would be to dfs(list, 0), and then in the first iteration, k=0, start_num is 1, loop from 1 to m, setting list(1) to next_num, then call dfs with k=1.\n\nThen, when k=1, start_num is list(1), loop from list(1) to m, set list(2), etc.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the score when the list is complete (k == n). So in the compute_score subroutine, we need to loop through all q conditions and compute the sum of d[i] where list(b[i]+1) - list(a[i]+1) == c[i].\n\nWait, but in the Java code, a[i] and b[i] are the indices after subtracting 1 (0-based), so in Fortran, the list is 1-based, so a[i] and b[i] are 0-based, so list(a[i]+1) would be the correct element.\n\nWait, for example, in Java, a[i] is 0-based, so list.get(a[i]) is the first element. In Fortran, list(1) is the first element, so to get the same element, we need to access list(a[i] + 1).\n\nSo yes, during the compute_score step, for each i from 1 to q:\n\nif list(b[i]+1) - list(a[i]+1) == c[i], then add d[i] to the score.\n\nOnce the score is computed, compare it to the current maximum (ans) and update if necessary.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nIn the Java code, a, b, c, d are arrays of size q. So in Fortran, they can be allocated as such. The input is read as n, m, q, then q lines of a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i. But in the Java code, a_i and b_i are read as (input value -1), converting from 1-based to 0-based.\n\nSo in Fortran, when reading each a_i and b_i, subtract 1.\n\nBut in Fortran, the variables are declared as integers. So:\n\nread *, a(i), b(i), c(i), d(i)\na(i) = a(i) - 1\nb(i) = b(i) - 1\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is 1-based. For example, if the problem's input is a_i=1 and b_i=2, then after subtraction, a(i)=0, b(i)=1, which are the 0-based indices.\n\nThen, during compute_score:\n\nsum = 0\ndo i = 1, q\n    if (list(b(i)+1) - list(a(i)+1) == c(i)) then\n        sum = sum + d(i)\n    end if\nend do\n\nSo the sum is computed correctly.\n\nThe maximum sum is tracked in a variable ans, which is initialized to -100 (since the Java code uses ans = -100L, but in Fortran, integers are 32-bit by default, but the problem may require larger numbers. Wait, the Java code uses 'long' for ans and score. So in Fortran, we need to use integer of kind 8 to handle large integers. Because if q is up to 50 and d[i] is up to 1e5, then the sum can be up to 5e6, which is within 32-bit integer. But in Java, 'long' is 64-bit. So to be safe, in Fortran, use integer(kind=8) for ans, sum, etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, declare ans as integer(8) :: ans = -100_8.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\n- Read n, m, q.\n\n- Allocate arrays a, b, c, d with size q.\n\n- Read each of the q lines into a, b, c, d, then adjust a and b by subtracting 1.\n\n- Call the dfs subroutine to generate all possible sequences.\n\n- After dfs returns, print ans.\n\nThe main challenge is implementing the dfs in Fortran with recursion, handling the list correctly.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the subroutine would need to be declared as recursive.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, q\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), b(:), c(:), d(:)\n    integer(8) :: ans = -100_8\n    integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n    integer :: i\n\n    read *, n, m, q\n    allocate(a(q), b(q), c(q), d(q))\n    do i = 1, q\n        read *, a(i), b(i), c(i), d(i)\n        a(i) = a(i) - 1\n        b(i) = b(i) - 1\n    end do\n\n    allocate(list(n))\n    call dfs(list, 0)\n    print *, ans\n\ncontains\n\n    recursive subroutine dfs(list, k)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: list(n)\n        integer, intent(in) :: k\n        integer(8) :: score\n        integer :: next_num, start_num, i\n\n        if (k == n) then\n            score = 0_8\n            do i = 1, q\n                if (list(b(i)+1) - list(a(i)+1) == c(i)) then\n                    score = score + d(i)\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (score > ans) then\n                ans = score\n            end if\n            return\n        end if\n\n        if (k == 0) then\n            start_num = 1\n        else\n            start_num = list(k)\n        end if\n\n        do next_num = start_num, m\n            list(k+1) = next_num\n            call dfs(list, k+1)\n        end do\n    end subroutine dfs\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but wait. The list array is passed as an argument to the recursive subroutine. In Fortran, when you pass an array to a subroutine, the subroutine receives it as an array with the same dimensions. So when modifying list(k+1) in the subroutine, the caller's list array is modified. However, during the loop over next_num, each iteration sets list(k+1) to next_num and then calls dfs. After the call returns, the next iteration overwrites list(k+1) again. So the backtracking is handled automatically. Because each call to dfs is modifying the same array, but each loop iteration resets the next element. This is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the Java code, the list is built in order. The Fortran code's list is built in the same way. For example, when k=0, the next_num starts at 1, list(1) is set to next_num, and dfs is called with k=1. Then, in the next level, when k=1, start_num is list(1), which is the previous next_num.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting for a simple case. For example, n=2, m=3, q=1, a=0, b=1, c=1, d=10. Then the possible sequences are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3). For each of these, check if the second element minus first equals 1. So sequences where the second element is first+1. For example, (1,2) gives 1, (2,3) gives 1. So the sum would be 10 for each of these, so ans would be 20 if there are two such sequences. Wait, no, in q=1, each sequence is checked once. So for each sequence, if the condition is met, add d=10. So ans would be 10 for (1,2) and (2,3), but (3,3) gives 0. So the maximum is 10.\n\nSo the code should generate all possible non-decreasing sequences of length n and compute the score.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The way a and b are adjusted. Since the input is read as a(i) and b(i) and then subtracted by 1, but in Fortran, the list is 1-based. So the code uses list(b(i)+1) - list(a(i)+1) to check. So the original Java code's logic is preserved.\n\n- Handling the maximum ans correctly. The initial ans is -100, but if all scores are higher, it will be updated correctly.\n\n- The use of integer(8) for ans and score to avoid overflow. Since in Java, it's a long, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, using integer(8) is appropriate.\n\n- The loop in the dfs subroutine. For each next_num from start_num to m, which is the same as the Java code's loop.\n\nAnother possible issue is the initial call to dfs. The list is allocated as list(n), and the initial call is with k=0. Then, in the first iteration, list(1) is set to next_num. The rest of the array is undefined, but since in the k ==n check, the code only uses list up to n elements, and the loops are controlled by k, the uninitialized elements beyond k+1 don't matter.\n\nWait, but in the recursive call, when k is less than n, the code loops through next_num from start_num to m, and sets list(k+1) to next_num, then calls dfs with k+1. So the array is built step by step. When k reaches n, the entire array is filled, and the score is computed based on all elements.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should work as intended."
