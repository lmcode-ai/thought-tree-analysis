    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nThe Java code reads input values N and x, then a list of N numbers. It creates a 2D array called costList where each entry is computed by taking the minimum between the previous value in the same row and a value from the srimeList with a certain index calculation. Then, for each possible i, it calculates a sum involving x multiplied by i and the sum of certain elements from costList. Finally, it finds the minimum of these results.\n\nFirst, let's map the data structures. The Java code uses ArrayList for srimeList and costList. In Fortran, we can use arrays. The srimeList is a 1D array of size N. The costList is a 2D array (N x N). \n\nThe first part of the code reads N and x. Then reads N elements into srimeList. In Fortran, we'll use READ statements. But Fortran's array indices start at 1 by default, which is different from Java's 0. So I need to be careful with loop indices. Wait, but in the Java code, the loops are from 0 to N-1. So in Fortran, maybe we can keep the same indices by declaring the arrays as (0:N-1) to match 0-based indexing. Alternatively, adjust the indices. Hmm. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in Java, for i from 0 to N-1, srimeList.get(i). In Fortran, if we use 1-based, then srimeList(i+1). But maybe it's easier to make the Fortran arrays 0-based. How to do that? In Fortran, you can specify the lower bound when declaring the array. For example, INTEGER, DIMENSION(0:N-1) :: srimeList. Similarly for the 2D array.\n\nSo, let's proceed by declaring the arrays with 0-based indices to match the Java code.\n\nNext, the costList in Java is a list of arrays. Each row i in costList has elements computed as follows: costList[i][0] = srimeList[i], then for each castNum from 1 to N-1, costList[i][castNum] is the minimum between the previous element (costList[i][castNum-1]) and srimeList[(i - castNum + N) % N]. \n\nWait, the (i - castNum + N) % N part is to handle negative values. So in Fortran, modulo can be done using MOD, but since Fortran's MOD can give negative results if the first argument is negative, we need to adjust it by adding N and then taking MOD again. Alternatively, use modulo function which ensures a non-negative result. So maybe (i - castNum + N) modulo N. For example, in Fortran, MODULO(i - castNum, N) would give a non-negative remainder. Wait, let's see: MODULO(-1,5) gives 4. So yes. So (i - castNum) can be negative, but MODULO(i - castNum, N) would give the correct index.\n\nWait, in the Java code, (i - castNum + N) % N. Let's see: if i - castNum is negative, adding N before mod ensures that the value is positive. But MODULO in Fortran would handle that. Let's compute for example: i=0, castNum=1. Then 0-1 = -1. MODULO(-1, N) would be N-1. So (i - castNum + N) % N would be (-1 + N) mod N = (N-1) mod N = N-1, same as MODULO(-1, N). So yes, using MODULO is equivalent.\n\nSo in Fortran, the index would be MODULO(i - castNum, N). So srimeList(MODULO(i - castNum, N) + 1) if srimeList is 1-based. Wait, no: if in Java, the array is 0-based, then in Fortran, if we use 0-based, then srimeList is 0-based. So in Fortran, the index would be MODULO(i - castNum, N). Because in Java, (i - castNum + N) % N gives a 0-based index. So in Fortran, using MODULO(i - castNum, N) would give the same result if the array is 0-based. But Fortran's arrays can be declared with 0-based indices.\n\nSo, for the srimeList and costList arrays in Fortran, we can declare them as:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_n = ... (but we can allocate dynamically)\nAssuming N is read at runtime, we can do:\n\ninteger :: N\nread(*,*) N\nallocate(srimeList(0:N-1))\nallocate(costList(0:N-1, 0:N-1))\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic allocation is done with the ALLOCATE statement. So in the code, first read N and x, then allocate the arrays.\n\nWait, but the Java code's costList is a list of Long arrays, each of size N. So in Fortran, a 2D array (N rows, N columns). So costList is N x N.\n\nSo for each i in 0..N-1, costList[i][0] = srimeList[i]. Then for castNum from 1 to N-1, costList[i][castNum] = min(costList[i][castNum-1], srimeList[(i - castNum + N) % N])\n\nIn Fortran, loops would be:\n\ndo i = 0, N-1\n    costList(i, 0) = srimeList(i)\n    do castNum = 1, N-1\n        idx = modulo(i - castNum, N)\n        costList(i, castNum) = min(costList(i, castNum-1), srimeList(idx))\n    end do\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nThen, the result part: for each i (from 0 to N-1), compute i*x plus the sum of costList[j][i] for all j from 0 to N-1. Wait, in the Java code, for each i in 0..N-1, the result is i * x plus the sum of costArray[j] for each costArray in costList. Wait, the Java code is:\n\nresult.add(i * x + costList.stream().mapToLong(costArray -> costArray[j]).sum());\n\nHere, j is the loop variable i. So for each i (the loop variable), j is set to i. Then, for each costArray in costList (each row of the 2D array), get the element at index j (i), and sum all those. So the sum is the sum of costList[k][i] for all k from 0 to N-1.\n\nSo the sum for each i is sum over all rows of costList's column i.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i in 0..N-1, sum the costList(:,i) elements.\n\nThen, the result is i*x plus this sum. Then find the minimum of all these results.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe can compute a result array of size 0..N-1.\n\ndo i = 0, N-1\n    total = i * x\n    do j = 0, N-1\n        total = total + costList(j, i)\n    end do\n    result(i) = total\nend do\n\nThen find the minimum in result array.\n\nBut wait, in Java, for each i, the sum is over all costArray[j], where j is i. Wait, the Java code is:\n\nresult.add(i * x + costList.stream().mapToLong(costArray -> costArray[j]).sum());\n\nHere, for each costArray (each row in costList), take costArray[j], where j is the current i. So the sum is the sum of all costList[k][i], for k from 0 to N-1. Because each costArray is a row. So costArray[j] is the j-th element of the row. So for all rows (k), take the j-th element (i-th in this case). So sum over k from 0 to N-1 of costList[k][i].\n\nIn Fortran, costList is a 2D array. The rows are the first index, columns the second. So costList(k, i) is the element in row k, column i. So the sum would be sum( costList(:, i) ), but since Fortran is column-major, but the indices are in (row, column) order. Wait, in the code, costList is declared as a list of Long[N], so each row is a separate array. In Java, costList.get(k)[j] is the j-th element of the k-th row. So in Fortran, that's costList(k, j). So the sum is sum over k of costList(k, i). So in Fortran, sum( costList(:, i) ), but since in the code, the rows are the first index and columns the second, yes.\n\nSo in Fortran, to get all rows (k) and column i, it's costList(:, i+1) if 1-based, but in our case, we are using 0-based. So for 0-based, it's costList(:, i).\n\nSo in the code:\n\nsum_cost = sum( costList(:, i) )\n\nThen total = i * x + sum_cost.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nNow, handling the data types. The Java code uses Long, which is 64-bit integers. In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) variables. But since x can be a long, and the sum could be large, we need to use 64-bit integers. So in Fortran, we should declare variables with integer(8) to handle large values.\n\nSo variables like x, srimeList, costList, result, sum_cost, etc. should be of integer(8) type.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code outline is:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, castNum, j\n    integer(8) :: x, idx, sum_cost, min_val\n    integer(8), allocatable :: srimeList(:)\n    integer(8), allocatable :: costList(:, :)\n    integer(8), allocatable :: result(:)\n    \n    read(*, *) N, x\n    allocate(srimeList(0:N-1))\n    do i = 0, N-1\n        read(*, *) srimeList(i)\n    end do\n    \n    allocate(costList(0:N-1, 0:N-1))\n    \n    do i = 0, N-1\n        costList(i, 0) = srimeList(i)\n        do castNum = 1, N-1\n            idx = modulo(i - castNum, N)\n            costList(i, castNum) = min( costList(i, castNum-1), srimeList(idx) )\n        end do\n    end do\n    \n    allocate(result(0:N-1))\n    \n    do i = 0, N-1\n        sum_cost = 0\n        do j = 0, N-1\n            sum_cost = sum_cost + costList(j, i)\n        end do\n        result(i) = i * x + sum_cost\n    end do\n    \n    min_val = result(0)\n    do i = 1, N-1\n        if (result(i) < min_val) then\n            min_val = result(i)\n        end if\n    end do\n    \n    print *, min_val\n    \n    deallocate(srimeList)\n    deallocate(costList)\n    deallocate(result)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, modulo function returns the same type as the input. Since i and castNum are integers (default kind, which is usually 4), but N is also an integer. So when calculating modulo(i - castNum, N), if i and castNum are 4-byte integers and N is large, this could overflow. Hmm. Need to be cautious. But in the Java code, the variables are long (64-bit). So perhaps in Fortran, all variables involved in indices should be 8-byte integers. Wait, no. Because N is up to 1e5, perhaps. So for i and castNum up to N-1. If N is up to 1e5, then i and castNum can fit in 4-byte integers (since 1e5 is 10^5, which is less than 2^31-1). So perhaps using default integer is okay. But to prevent overflow in (i - castNum), since i and castNum are up to N-1. So if N is up to 2e5, then (i - castNum) can be as low as -(N-1) + 0 = -(N-1). So if N is 2e5, that's -2e5, which is within 4-byte integer (-2e9 to 2e9). So modulo is okay.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps declare i, castNum, j as integer(8). Or use default integer, as Fortran's default integer is typically 4 bytes, but depends on the compiler. Alternatively, since the problem may involve larger N, but according to the original code's variables, N is an int, so 4-byte. So in Fortran, using default integer should be okay.\n\nSo variables N is read as a 4-byte integer, i, castNum, j as 4-byte integers, and x, srimeList, costList, result as 8-byte integers.\n\nBut the code in Java uses long for x and srimeList elements. So in Fortran, we need to read x and srimeList as 8-byte integers. Also, variables that hold these values, like idx, sum_cost, min_val, must be 8-byte.\n\nSo the code as written above should work.\n\nBut need to check for the array indices. When we allocate srimeList(0:N-1), the valid indices are 0 to N-1.\n\nAnother thing: when reading the input, for the srimeList elements, in Java, the code uses a loop from i=0 to N-1. In Fortran, the loop is do i=0, N-1, which will loop N times (0,1,...,N-1). So that's correct.\n\nThen, the costList is filled. For each row i, castNum ranges from 1 to N-1. The inner loop is castNum = 1, N-1, which is correct.\n\nThen, for the result array, each i is 0 to N-1. The sum over j=0 to N-1 of costList(j, i).\n\nYes.\n\nFinally, the minimum is found by initializing min_val to result(0), then comparing each result(i) from i=1 to N-1.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut let's test with a sample input.\n\nSample Input 1 (from a possible test case):\n\nSuppose N=2, x=10\n\nsrimeList is [3, 5]\n\nThen:\n\ncostList for i=0:\n\ncastNum=0: costList[0][0] = 3\n\ncastNum=1: min(3, srimeList[(0-1 +2) mod 2] ) = min(3, srimeList[1]) = min(3,5) =3. So costList[0][1] =3.\n\ni=1:\n\ncastNum=0: costList[1][0] =5\n\ncastNum=1: min(5, srimeList[(1-1) mod 2] = srimeList[0] =3. So min(5,3)=3. So costList[1][1] =3.\n\nThen result for each i:\n\ni=0: 0*10 + costList[0][0] + costList[1][0] \u2192 0 +3 +5=8 \u2192 8.\n\ni=1:1*10 + costList[0][1] + costList[1][1] \u219210 +3 +3=16 \u219216. So minimum is 8.\n\nSo the code should output 8.\n\nIn Fortran, the code would compute that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Declaration of arrays as 0-based. In Fortran, arrays can be declared with any lower bound, including 0. So using (0:N-1) is allowed.\n\n- MODULO function in Fortran for negative numbers. For example, MODULO(-1, 2) gives 1, which is correct.\n\n- Data types: Using integer(8) for variables that need to hold large numbers.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be correct."
