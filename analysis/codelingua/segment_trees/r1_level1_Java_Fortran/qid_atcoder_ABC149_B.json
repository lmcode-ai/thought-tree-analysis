    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, where do I start? Let's look at the Java code first.\n\nThe Java code reads three long integers A, B, K from the input. Then it does some calculations. The main logic is in the calc method. Let's understand what it does.\n\nIn the calc method, x is set to A - K. If x becomes negative, then y becomes B + x (which is B + (A - K)), but x is then set to 0. Also, if y ends up negative, it's set to 0. Otherwise, if x wasn't negative, then y remains B.\n\nSo the logic is: subtract K from A. If that's not enough, take the remaining from B. And ensure both x and y are non-negative.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program needs to read three integers from standard input. In Java, they're using BufferedReader and splitting the line. In Fortran, we can read from the console using read(*,*) to get the three variables.\n\nFortran uses implicit types unless specified. Since the variables are long in Java, maybe they are 64-bit integers. In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for that. Or perhaps the problem allows using default integers, but to be safe, maybe use integer*8 for A, B, K, x, y.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variable declarations are at the start. So the variables A, B, K, x, y should be declared first.\n\nThe main steps are:\n\nRead A, B, K.\n\nCompute x = A - K.\n\nIf x < 0, then y = B + x (since x is negative here, this subtracts the remaining from B). Then set x to 0. Then check if y is negative, set y to 0.\n\nElse, y remains B.\n\nSo the code structure in Fortran would be:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer*8 :: A, B, K, x, y\n  read(*,*) A, B, K\n  x = A - K\n  if (x < 0) then\n    y = B + x  ! because x is negative here, this subtracts\n    x = 0\n    if (y < 0) then\n      y = 0\n    end if\n  else\n    y = B\n  end if\n  print *, x, y\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Java, the code uses long variables, which are 64-bit integers. So in Fortran, using integer*8 would correspond to that. But I need to check if Fortran supports that. Yes, using integer(kind=8) or integer*8 (though the latter is a non-standard but widely supported extension).\n\nAlternatively, use integer(8) if that's available. But to keep it simple, maybe use integer*8.\n\nAnother point: The Java code reads from standard input, so the Fortran code should read from standard input as well.\n\nTesting with some examples:\n\nFor example, if A=2, B=3, K=3: then x = 2-3 = -1. So x becomes 0, y=3 + (-1) = 2. So output is 0 2.\n\nAnother example: A=5, B=5, K=10. x=5-10 = -5. Then y=5 + (-5) =0. So output 0 0.\n\nIf K is less than A, like A=5, K=3. x=2, y=5. Output 2 5.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, putting this into Fortran. The code structure seems straightforward. Declare variables, read input, compute x and y based on conditions, then print.\n\nSo the translated code should look like the above.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the read statement is read(*,*) variables. So the program reads a line, splits into the variables. That's the same as the Java code, which splits the input line into tokens.\n\nSo the Fortran code should work as intended.\n\nI think that's all. Let me write the code."
