    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does. So it's handling memory allocation, erasing, and defragmentation. The main data structure is an array called memory, which represents the blocks. Let me think about how to structure this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses fixed-size arrays, so I'll need to declare the memory array with a size, probably as an allocatable array if the size m is read at runtime. Wait, but in Fortran, the size of arrays in subroutines can be determined at runtime if they are dummy arguments. Hmm, maybe I can have a main program that reads t and m, then processes each command.\n\nThe variables involved: t is the number of commands, m is the size of the memory. Then allocIdx is the allocation index, starting from 0 and increments each time an allocation happens. So in Fortran, variables like alloc_idx need to be declared. Also, the memory array is initialized to zero.\n\nLet me start by setting up the main structure. The original Java code uses a loop over t commands, each processed via a switch case. In Fortran, I'll use a select case structure inside a do loop.\n\nFor the 'alloc' case: The code looks for a contiguous block of n zeros in memory. If found, it allocates by setting those positions to allocIdx. So in Fortran, I'll loop through the memory array, tracking the current length of consecutive zeros. Once len reaches n, mark the starting index and fill.\n\nThe 'erase' case: Find all elements equal to x and set them to zero. Check if x is positive. If not, print error. Also, if no elements were erased, error.\n\nThe 'defragment' case: Move all non-zero elements to the front, maintaining order, and fill the rest with zeros. The Java code uses a d variable to track the number of zeros encountered. For each element, if it's non-zero, move it to i-d position, then after processing all, set the last d elements to zero.\n\nNow, let's handle input. In Java, it's using a Scanner. In Fortran, we'll read from standard input. For each command, read a string, then depending on the command, read additional integers. For example, after 'alloc', read n. After 'erase', read x.\n\nWait, Fortran's read statements can be tricky. So for each iteration of the loop, first read the command string, then handle the specific inputs. But how to read the next token? Since the input is line-based, perhaps using formatted reads. Let me think. Each command is a line starting with a string. For example:\n\nalloc 5\nerase 2\ndefragment\n\nSo when the command is 'alloc' or 'erase', there's an integer following. The Java code uses s.next() for the command, then s.nextInt() for the numbers.\n\nIn Fortran, I'll read a line, then parse the command and any arguments. Alternatively, read the command first, then read the integer if needed. But how to handle this?\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line and process it. Let's see. For each command, read a line, split into tokens. The first token is the command. For 'alloc' and 'erase', the next token is the integer.\n\nSo perhaps in Fortran, for each iteration:\n\nread a line from input, split into words. The first word is the command. Then process accordingly.\n\nBut handling this can be a bit involved. Since Fortran's string handling is a bit limited, maybe we can read the command as a string, then check its value. But when the command is 'alloc' or 'erase', we need to read the integer. So perhaps read the command, and then read the integer only if needed.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line into a buffer, then parse the command and the optional integer. This might be better. For example, using a character buffer of sufficient length. Then use the index function to find the first space, then extract the command and the integer.\n\nBut this can get a bit complex. Another approach is to read the command first, then read the integer if the command is 'alloc' or 'erase'. However, this may not work if the input lines are structured with the command and integer on the same line. Because, for example, after reading 'alloc', the next read would read the integer from the same line. But in Fortran, when using list-directed input (read *, ...), each read statement starts from the next line. Wait, no. List-directed reads with free-format will read tokens sequentially, regardless of lines. So if the input line is \"alloc 5\", then reading the command first as a string, then the integer would work. Because the first read gets 'alloc', the next read gets 5. But the problem is that after reading the command, the next read may consume the next line's data. Wait, no. For example, if the input is:\n\n3 10\nalloc 5\nerase 2\ndefragment\n\nThen the initial read of t and m is done with read(*,*) t, m. Then, for each of the t commands, read the command. So for the first command line, which is \"alloc 5\", reading the command as a string would get 'alloc', then reading n would get 5. But in Fortran, when using list-directed input (read *), each read starts a new line. Wait, no. List-directed input skips over line breaks. So if you have:\n\nread *, a\nread *, b\n\nAnd the input is:\n\n1\n2\n\nThen a=1, b=2. But if the input is:\n\n1 2\n\nThen a=1, b=2. So when you read a line, the read statement reads as many values as needed from the input, possibly consuming multiple lines. So in the case of a command line like \"alloc 5\", read *, command would get 'alloc', and the next read *, n would take the 5 from the same line. But in Fortran, when you use list-directed reads, each read statement starts a new record (line) unless there are multiple values on the same line.\n\nWait, no. Let me check. For example, suppose the input lines are:\n\nalloc 5\nerase 3\n\nThen:\n\nread *, command   ! reads 'alloc'\nread *, n         ! reads 5 (from the same line)\nread *, command   ! reads 'erase'\nread *, x         ! reads 3\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read from a line with multiple entries, each read statement will take the next entry. So that's correct.\n\nBut in Java's Scanner, next() and nextInt() read tokens sequentially, regardless of line breaks. So if we read the command, then the integer, it would work. But in Fortran, how to handle that?\n\nThe code in Java reads the command via s.next(), which reads the next token (split by whitespace). So in Fortran, using read *, command for the first token, then read *, n for the next token, which could be on the same line.\n\nBut in Fortran, each read statement reads a new line by default. Wait, no. The default is to read from the next record (line) unless there's more data on the current line. So for example, if the input line is \"alloc 5\", then the first read *, command would read 'alloc', and the next read *, n would read 5 from the same line. Then, the next read would proceed to the next line.\n\nThis is correct. So in Fortran, for the 'alloc' and 'erase' commands, after reading the command, we can read the integer from the same line. For 'defragment', there's no integer to read. So in the code, after reading the command, we need to handle each case.\n\nSo, for each iteration of the loop:\n\nread *, command\n\nthen:\n\nselect case (command)\n\ncase ('alloc')\n\nread *, n\n\nprocess alloc\n\ncase ('erase')\n\nread *, x\n\nprocess erase\n\ncase ('defragment')\n\nprocess defragment\n\ncase default\n\nprint *, 'h'\n\nend select\n\nBut in Fortran, the read statements will read from the same line if the data is present. So that's okay.\n\nSo that's how to handle the input.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nThe memory array is of size m. So in Fortran, we can declare it as an array, dimension(m) :: memory. Since m is read from input, we need to allocate it. Wait, in Fortran, you can have automatic arrays if the size is known at the time of the procedure's entry. So in the main program, after reading m, we can declare the array.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables must be declared before executable statements. So the code would be structured as:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: t, m, alloc_idx, j, n, x, d, i, len, start_pos\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: memory\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: command\n\nread(*, *) t, m\n\nallocate(memory(m))\n\nmemory = 0\n\nalloc_idx = 0\n\ndo j = 1, t\n\n    read(*, *) command\n\n    select case (command)\n\n    case ('alloc')\n\n        read(*, *) n\n\n        ! code for allocation\n\n    case ('erase')\n\n        read(*, *) x\n\n        ! code for erase\n\n    case ('defragment')\n\n        ! code for defragment\n\n    case default\n\n        print *, 'h'\n\n    end select\n\nend do\n\nend program main\n\nBut wait, the initial read of t and m is from the same line. The first line of input is t and m. Then the next t lines are the commands, each possibly with arguments. Wait, in the original Java code, the commands are read via s.next() and s.nextInt(), which read tokens regardless of line breaks. So for example, if the input is:\n\n3 10\nalloc 5\nerase 2\ndefragment\n\nBut it's possible that the commands are spread over multiple lines, as long as each command's tokens are present. However, the original code reads t commands, each being a single command (alloc, erase, defragment). So in the Fortran code, each command is read via read(*, *) command, which will read the first token of the next line each time, because after reading t and m, each read(*, *) command will read the next line's first token, assuming that each command is on a separate line.\n\nWait, no. The first line is t and m. Then, the next lines are the t commands. Each command may be on a separate line. For example:\n\nalloc 5 is a line, erase 2 is another, defragment is another. So the code will read each line's first token as the command. So in Fortran, each read(*, *) command reads the first token of each subsequent line. Then, for 'alloc' and 'erase', the next read(*, *) n or x will read the next token from the same line. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code structure should work.\n\nNow, the 'alloc' case:\n\nIn Java, the code loops through the memory array to find a block of n consecutive zeros. Once found, it marks those positions with allocIdx (after incrementing it). Then outputs the allocIdx. If not found, output NULL.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nWe can loop through the memory array, tracking the current length of consecutive zeros. When len reaches n, set can_alloc to true, find the starting index (i - n + 1?), then break.\n\nWait, the Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n    if (memory[i] == 0) len++;\n    else len = 0;\n    if (len == n) {\n        canAlloc = true;\n        len = i - n + 1;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the len in Java code is the current streak of zeros. Once it reaches n, then the starting index is i - n + 1. So for example, if n is 3, and the streak is from i=2,3,4 (indices 2,3,4), then len becomes 3 at i=4. So start index is 4 -3 +1 = 2. Then the code uses that to set the memory from len to len +n -1. Because in Java, for (int i = len; i < len +n; i++) { ... }, which would be from len to len +n -1, inclusive.\n\nSo in Fortran, the starting index is start_pos = i -n +1 (assuming i starts from 1 in Fortran? Wait, Java uses zero-based, Fortran arrays are usually 1-based. So need to adjust indices.\n\nWait, the original code uses memory array with indices 0 to m-1. In Fortran, the array is 1-based. So when translating loops, we need to loop from 1 to m.\n\nSo for the 'alloc' case:\n\nInitialize len to 0, can_alloc to .false., start_pos to 0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to m:\n\n    if memory(i) == 0 then\n\n        len = len +1\n\n    else\n\n        len = 0\n\n    end if\n\n    if (len == n) then\n\n        can_alloc = .true.\n\n        start_pos = i -n +1\n\n        exit ! break the loop\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nIf can_alloc is true, then increment alloc_idx, set memory(start_pos : start_pos +n -1) to alloc_idx. Then print alloc_idx. Else, print 'NULL'.\n\nWait, but in Java, the starting index is len (after setting len = i -n +1), and then for loop runs from len to len +n, exclusive, so i < len +n. So that's n elements.\n\nIn Fortran, if start_pos is i -n +1 (assuming i is the current index where the streak of n zeros ends), then the elements from start_pos to start_pos +n-1 (inclusive) are set.\n\nFor example, if i is 5 (Fortran 1-based), and n is 3. Then start_pos =5-3 +1 =3. So positions 3,4,5.\n\nWait, wait, in Java, the code after len == n sets len = i -n +1. Let's see: in Java, the loop is for (int i=0; ...). Suppose i is 4 (zero-based), and n=3. So the three zeros are at i=2,3,4 (if they are consecutive)? Or maybe i=2 is the third in a row. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose memory has zeros starting at position 2 (0-based) for 3 elements: 2,3,4. Then len is incremented each time. At i=2, len=1. i=3, len=2. i=4, len=3. So when len ==3 (n=3), then start_pos is 4-3 +1 =2. So the starting index is 2 (zero-based). Then in Java, the loop runs from 2 to 2+3 (exclusive), i.e., 2,3,4. So three elements.\n\nIn Fortran, if we have 1-based indices, then for the same scenario, i is 5 (positions 3,4,5 in 1-based). Then start_pos would be i -n +1 =5-3+1=3. So the elements 3,4,5 would be set. Which is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, once can_alloc is true, set:\n\nalloc_idx = alloc_idx +1\n\ndo i = start_pos, start_pos +n -1\n\n    memory(i) = alloc_idx\n\nend do\n\nprint *, alloc_idx\n\nElse, print *, 'NULL'\n\nOkay.\n\nNow the 'erase' case:\n\nIn Java, when the command is 'erase x', check if x <=0: error. Then loop through the memory array, set any element equal to x to zero. If none were found, error.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nIf x <=0, print 'ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT' and cycle.\n\nElse:\n\nLoop over memory from 1 to m. If any element equals x, set to zero. Keep track if any were erased.\n\nAfter the loop, if none were erased, print the error.\n\nSo:\n\ncase ('erase')\n\n    read(*,*) x\n\n    if (x <= 0) then\n\n        print *, 'ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT'\n\n        cycle\n\n    end if\n\n    has_erased = .false.\n\n    do i=1, m\n\n        if (memory(i) == x) then\n\n            memory(i) = 0\n\n            has_erased = .true.\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (.not. has_erased) then\n\n        print *, 'ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT'\n\n    end if\n\nNow, the 'defragment' case:\n\nThe Java code compacts the memory by moving non-zero elements to the front, preserving their order, and filling the rest with zeros.\n\nHow it works: d is the number of zeros encountered so far. For each element, if it's non-zero, move it to i-d position, then if it's zero, increment d. Then, after all elements are processed, set the last d elements to zero.\n\nWait, Java code:\n\nint d =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i < m; i++) {\n\n    if (memory[i] ==0) d++;\n\n    else memory[i -d] = memory[i];\n\n}\n\nfor (int i= m -d; i < m; i++) memory[i] =0;\n\nSo, for each element in order:\n\n- if it's zero, d increases by 1.\n\n- else, it's moved to i -d.\n\nSo for example:\n\nOriginal array: 0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\ni=0: zero, d=1.\n\ni=1: non-zero (1), moved to 1-1=0. Now position 0 is 1. d remains 1.\n\ni=2: zero, d=2.\n\ni=3: non-zero (2), moved to 3-2=1. Position 1 is 2. d remains 2.\n\ni=4: non-zero (3), moved to 4-2=2. Position 2 is 3. d remains 2.\n\ni=5: zero, d=3.\n\ni=6: zero, d=4.\n\nThen after processing all elements, the new array up to m-d is 1,2,3, and the rest are zeroed.\n\nIn Fortran, the code can be:\n\nd =0\n\ndo i=1, m\n\n    if (memory(i) ==0) then\n\n        d = d +1\n\n    else\n\n        if (d >0) then\n\n            memory(i -d) = memory(i)\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\n! then zero the last d elements\n\ndo i= m -d +1, m\n\n    memory(i) =0\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, after moving the non-zero elements, the code loops from m-d to m-1 (inclusive) and sets to zero. Since m is the length of the array.\n\nIn Fortran, the indices are 1-based. So m-d is the starting index of the zeros. For example, if m=7, d=4, then m-d =3. So positions 3,4,5,6,7 (no, m=7, m-d=3, so from 3 to 7. But d=4, the number of zeros is 4. So the last four elements are set to zero. Wait, m-d =7-4=3. So from 3+1 to 7: positions 4 to 7. But that's 4 elements, which is correct.\n\nWait, the Java code loops from i = m -d to i < m. So in Java, m-d is the starting index (zero-based), and the loop runs m -d to m-1. Which is d elements.\n\nIn Fortran, to cover the last d elements, the loop should run from (m -d +1) to m. Because m-d+1 + (d-1) = m.\n\nFor example, m=7, d=4: 7-4+1=4. From 4 to 7: 4,5,6,7: four elements. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code for defragment:\n\nd =0\n\ndo i=1, m\n\n    if (memory(i) ==0) then\n\n        d =d +1\n\n    else\n\n        if (d >0) then\n\n            memory(i -d) = memory(i)\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now zero the last d elements\n\ndo i = (m - d +1), m\n\n    memory(i) =0\n\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Java, the code moves each non-zero element to i-d, but in Java's code, during the loop, even if d is zero, the code still does memory[i -d] = memory[i]. But when d is zero, it's just memory[i] = memory[i], which is redundant. So in Fortran, the if (d>0) check is added to avoid unnecessary assignments. But perhaps in the original code, even when d is zero, the code still runs. But in practice, when d is zero, it's only when there are no zeros encountered so far. So the elements are already in place.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, the check if (d>0) is added. Hmm, but perhaps the code should proceed even when d is zero. Let me think: For example, if there are no zeros up to a certain point, d remains zero. Then, moving the elements to i-d (which is i) is redundant. So in that case, the code is the same as original. So perhaps the check can be omitted.\n\nBut in the original Java code, the assignment is done even when d is zero. So perhaps in Fortran, remove the if (d>0) condition.\n\nSo:\n\ndo i=1, m\n\n    if (memory(i) ==0) then\n\n        d =d +1\n\n    else\n\n        memory(i -d) = memory(i)\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, when d is zero, i-d could be i-0 = i, so the element is copied to itself. Which is harmless. So yes, this code is equivalent to the Java code.\n\nBut then after this loop, the code needs to zero the last d elements. So the loop from (m-d+1) to m.\n\nSo that's the defragment code.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Fortran's strings are case-sensitive. So if the input command is in uppercase, like 'Alloc', it would not match. But the Java code uses s.next() which is case-sensitive. So assuming the input is lowercase as per the problem statement.\n\n- The variable alloc_idx starts at 0, increments before assignment. Wait, in Java, after can_alloc is true, allocIdx is incremented by 1, then the new value is assigned to the memory. So allocIdx starts at 0, then becomes 1, 2, etc. So in Fortran, the initial value of alloc_idx is 0, and when can_alloc is true, alloc_idx is incremented by 1, then the memory is filled with the new value.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing:\n\nFor example, the first alloc command. Suppose m=10, and we need to allocate 3 blocks. The code finds the first three consecutive zeros. The Fortran code should handle that.\n\nAnother case: erase with x=0 is invalid.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nPotential errors:\n\n- In defragment, when m is zero? But m is read from input, and in the Java code, the initial allocation is memory = new int[m], which allows m=0. But the problem statement probably ensures m is positive.\n\nBut in Fortran, if m is zero, the array allocation would fail. So perhaps the code should handle m>=0. But according to the problem statement, m is given as a positive integer.\n\nBut in the code, when reading m, it's possible that m is zero. But the original Java code creates an array of size m, so m must be >=0. So in Fortran, when m is zero, the code may crash. But the problem statement probably ensures m is positive. So assuming that m is positive.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nPutting all together, the Fortran code would look like this."
