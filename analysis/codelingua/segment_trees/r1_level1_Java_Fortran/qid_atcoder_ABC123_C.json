    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program reads a long integer N and then reads five more numbers. It finds the minimum of those five numbers. Then it calculates the ceiling of N divided by that minimum and adds 4. Finally, it prints the result.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to read input in Fortran. In Java, they're using Scanner to read from System.in. In Fortran, I'll use read statements. But Fortran can be a bit particular about input and data types.\n\nSo the first thing is to read N. The Java code uses nextLong(), which is a 64-bit integer. In Fortran, I can use integer(kind=8) to handle large integers. Then, there's a loop that reads five numbers and finds the minimum. Let's see.\n\nIn Java, the loop starts with i from 0 to 4 (five times). For the first iteration (i=0), it sets min to the first input. For the others, it compares with the current min. So in Fortran, I'll read each value, compare, and keep track of the minimum.\n\nNow, the calculation: (N / min) rounded up. In Java, Math.ceil is used. But since N and min are integers, dividing them as doubles and then ceiling. For example, if N is 10 and min is 3, 10/3 is 3.333..., ceiling is 4. So the equivalent in Fortran would be (N + min - 1) / min. Because adding min-1 ensures that integer division rounds up.\n\nSo the formula becomes (N + min - 1) / min + 4.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Read N as a long integer (integer*8 in Fortran)\n- Read five numbers, find the minimum among them\n- Compute (N + min -1) / min +4\n- Print the result as a long integer.\n\nNow, Fortran's read might require that the variables are in a certain format. Let's see. When reading from standard input, each read statement typically reads from a line, but I can have multiple reads. However, in the Java code, the input is read in sequence: first N, then the next five numbers. So the input is one line for N, then possibly another line for the five numbers, or maybe all in one line. But Fortran's read is line-based unless specified otherwise. Hmm, but the original code uses Scanner which parses tokens, so input could be split into any whitespace. So in Fortran, the read statements will read the numbers regardless of line breaks.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nRead N\nRead the five numbers, one by one, and track the minimum.\n\nWait, but reading the five numbers can be done in a loop. Let me think. For the five numbers, the Java code reads them in a loop. So in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: N, min_val, temp\ninteger :: i\n\nread(*,*) N\nmin_val = 0\ndo i = 1, 5\n    read(*,*) temp\n    if (i == 1) then\n        min_val = temp\n    else\n        if (temp < min_val) then\n            min_val = temp\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen compute the result as (N + min_val -1) / min_val +4\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, integer division truncates towards zero. So (N + min_val -1) divided by min_val would give the ceiling of N/min_val. For example, N=10, min=3: 10+3-1=12, 12/3=4. Correct. So that's the way to do it.\n\nThen, print the result as an integer.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC123_C\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8) :: N, min_val, temp, res\n    integer :: i\n\n    read(*,*) N\n    do i = 1, 5\n        read(*,*) temp\n        if (i == 1) then\n            min_val = temp\n        else\n            if (temp < min_val) then\n                min_val = temp\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    res = (N + min_val -1) / min_val +4\n    print *, res\n\nend program atcoder_ABC123_C\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you have integer division, it does truncate towards zero, but in this case, since N and min_val are positive, the formula works.\n\nTesting with example inputs. Let's say N=5, and the five numbers are 3,3,3,3,3. Then min_val is 3. (5+3-1)/3 is (7)/3=2.333... -> 2. Then +4 gives 6. But the actual ceiling(5/3) is 2, so 2+4=6. Correct.\n\nAnother example: N=10, min_val=3. (10+3-1)/3 =12/3=4. 4+4=8. Which matches the Java code's calculation.\n\nSo that should work.\n\nI need to make sure that all variables are declared with the right kind. In Fortran, integer(kind=8) is used for 64-bit integers, which corresponds to Java's long.\n\nAlso, the Java code has various p() methods for printing, but in Fortran, just using print *.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
