    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does first. The code is for a problem where we have a tree structure, and we need to color the edges such that no two edges from the same node have the same color. The goal is to find the minimum number of colors needed and output the colors for each edge.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure. The Java code uses an adjacency list with a list of lists of Edge objects. Each Edge has an id and a to (the node it connects to). The main logic is in the dfs function, which assigns colors to edges as it traverses the tree.\n\nFortran doesn't have classes, so I need to represent the Edge structures differently. Maybe using arrays or derived types. Fortran has derived types, which are similar to structs. So I can define a type for Edge with id and to components. But wait, in Fortran, arrays of derived types can be managed, but handling dynamic arrays might be tricky.\n\nWait, the Java code uses an ArrayList of ArrayLists for the adjacency list. In Fortran, I can create an array of arrays, but since each node can have a variable number of edges, perhaps using allocatable arrays for each node's edges. But Fortran's handling of arrays of arrays is a bit limited. Alternatively, maybe using a single array for all edges, keeping track of each node's edges with indices. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since in the problem, each edge is processed in the order of the adjacency list, perhaps in Fortran, for each node, we can have an array of edges, each edge being a derived type with id and to. But in Fortran, the maximum size of each adjacency list would need to be determined. Since it's a tree, each node can have up to n-1 edges, but that's inefficient. Wait, but in the Java code, the adjacency list is built by adding edges for each node as they are read. So perhaps in Fortran, for each node, we can have a dynamic array of edges. But Fortran's dynamic arrays (allocatable) can be handled with reallocate and such, but that's a bit cumbersome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a pre-allocated array with a maximum possible size. Since n can be up to 1e5 or similar (but the problem's constraints are not given), but for the purpose of this code, maybe we can use a maximum size. But in the original code, n is read from input, so the Fortran code must handle variable n.\n\nAnother approach: in Fortran, for each node, store the edges as a linked list, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, since in the problem, the edges are processed in a way that each node's edges are traversed during the dfs, perhaps using a two-dimensional array where each row represents a node, and each entry is an edge (id, to). But Fortran's handling of arrays of derived types can be manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Declare a derived type EdgeType with id and to.\n- Create an array of EdgeType for each node. But since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays of arrays easily, perhaps using a fixed maximum size for each adjacency list. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps using an array of pointers to arrays. Hmm, but Fortran's pointer usage can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, use a single array to store all edges, and for each node, keep track of the start and end index in that array. But that might complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe in Fortran, using an allocatable array of arrays. Wait, Fortran 2003 allows arrays of allocatable components. So perhaps:\n\ntype EdgeType\n  integer :: id, to\nend type\n\ntype(EdgeType), allocatable :: g(:,:)\n\nBut no, that's not correct. Because each node's list of edges can vary in length. So instead, perhaps using a jagged array structure. For example, an array of pointers to arrays. But Fortran doesn't have pointers in the same way as C or Java. Alternatively, use a 2D array where the first dimension is the node, and the second dimension is the edges for that node, up to a certain maximum. But that's memory inefficient. Alternatively, since each edge is bidirectional (the code adds the edge to both a and b), but in the tree traversal, each edge is processed once. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, in the Java code, the edges are stored for each node in the adjacency list. For example, when adding an edge between a and b, both a's and b's lists get an Edge object. The id is the same for both directions. So, when building the adjacency list in Fortran, each node's edge list contains all edges connected to it, including the reverse edges. But during traversal, the code checks if the next node is the parent to avoid cycles.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can represent the adjacency list as an array of EdgeType arrays. But again, dynamic arrays per node. So perhaps use a derived type that contains an allocatable array of EdgeType. For example:\n\ntype EdgeList\n  type(EdgeType), allocatable :: edges(:)\nend type\n\ntype(EdgeList), allocatable :: g(:)\n\nThen, for each node, g(i)%edges is the list of edges for node i.\n\nYes, this seems feasible. So in Fortran, the code would:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Allocate g(n), each element being an EdgeList, whose edges array is dynamically allocated.\n\nThen, for each input edge (a and b), subtract 1 (since Java uses 0-based, Fortran can use 1-based or 0-based; need to adjust indices).\n\nWait, the original Java code uses 0-based indices. So in Fortran, maybe use 1-based to avoid confusion. So when reading a and b from input, they are converted from 1-based to 0-based in Java. So in Fortran, we can read them as integers, subtract 1 to get 0-based, or read and use 1-based directly. Wait, perhaps in Fortran, it's easier to use 1-based indices.\n\nWait, the original code reads a and b, subtracts 1 to get 0-based indices. So in the Fortran code, perhaps the nodes are 1-based. Let me check.\n\nIn Java, for example, when inputting a and b, the code does a-1 and b-1. So the original input is 1-based. So in Fortran, since the code uses 0-based for the nodes, perhaps in Fortran, after reading a and b, we subtract 1 to get 0-based? Or maybe adjust to 1-based in Fortran.\n\nThis is a critical part. Let's see:\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nint a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next()) - 1;\nint b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next()) - 1;\n\nSo the input is 1-based, and the code converts to 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps nodes are 0-based as well. But Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but can be 0-based if specified. So perhaps in Fortran, the code will use 0-based indices for nodes. So when reading a and b, subtract 1, then store in the adjacency list.\n\nBut in Fortran, handling 0-based arrays can be done by specifying the lower bound. For example:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: something\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use 1-based arrays and adjust the input. Let's think: in the Fortran code, when reading a and b, they are in 1-based. So subtract 1 to get 0-based. Then the code can be written with 0-based nodes, but Fortran arrays can be 1-based. Hmm, perhaps this will complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps in Fortran, keep nodes as 1-based.\n\nWait, the code in Java uses a list of edges for each node (from 0 to n-1). So for Fortran, perhaps if the nodes are 1-based, then the code can have g(1) to g(n), each representing a node. Then, when reading a and b, subtract 1 from each to get 0-based? Wait no, in Java code, after subtracting 1, a and b are 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps when reading a and b, subtract 1 to get 0-based, but since Fortran's arrays are 1-based by default, maybe adjust the code to use 1-based nodes. For example, node 1 to node n. So in the input, a and b are 1-based, subtract 1 to get 0-based (Java code). But in Fortran, maybe when reading a and b, we read as 1-based, but then use them as 1-based in Fortran. Wait, but in the Java code, the nodes are 0-based.\n\nWait, the original code reads a and b (like 3 and 5, for example), then subtract 1, so a becomes 2 and b becomes 4. These are 0-based indices. So in Fortran, perhaps it's easier to convert them to 1-based. For example, if the input is 3 and 5, in Fortran, they would be 3 and 5 (1-based), so no need to subtract. But in the code, the nodes are 0-based. So in Fortran, to match the code, perhaps read a and b, subtract 1, and use them as 0-based indices. But Fortran arrays are 1-based. So perhaps in Fortran, nodes are 0-based, but the code will have to handle that. Let me think.\n\nIn Fortran, the code can have the nodes from 0 to n-1. But arrays can be declared with lower bounds. For example:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: ...\n\nBut in Fortran, if n is read at runtime, you can do:\n\ninteger :: n\nread *, n\nallocate(g(0:n-1))\n\nBut perhaps using 0-based indices in Fortran.\n\nSo for the adjacency list g, in Fortran, it's an array from 0 to n-1. Each element is a list of edges. Each edge has an id and a to node.\n\nSo when reading a and b from input, we subtract 1 to make them 0-based.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize g as an array of EdgeList, with indices from 0 to n-1.\n\nThen, read n-1 edges. For each, read a and b (1-based in input), subtract 1 to make them 0-based. Then add the edge to both a and b's adjacency lists. Each edge has an id (the index of the edge in the input, from 0 to n-2) and the to node.\n\nWait, in the Java code, each edge in the input is processed as per their order. The id is the index i from 0 to n-2. So for the first edge (i=0), when added to a and b's adjacency lists, the Edge objects have id=0.\n\nSo in Fortran, the edges are numbered from 0 to n-2.\n\nSo during the reading loop (for i from 0 to n-2), each edge is read as a and b (after subtracting 1). Then, for each edge, we add to a's adjacency list an Edge with id=i and to=b. Similarly, add to b's adjacency list an Edge with id=i and to=a.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to process each edge in the order of input, storing their id accordingly.\n\nOnce the adjacency list is built, the ans array is of size n-1. Each edge's color is stored here. The ans array in Java is initialized as ans = new int[n-1], which is zero-initialized. But in Fortran, when allocating ans, the elements start as undefined, so need to initialize them.\n\nThen the dfs function is called with to=0 (the root node, assuming 0-based), color=-1 (no parent color), parents=-1 (no parent). The dfs function assigns colors to the edges.\n\nIn the dfs function, for each edge in the current node's adjacency list, we check if the edge's to is the parent. If so, skip. Otherwise, assign a color k, starting from 1, but avoiding the parent's color. Then assign ans[e.id] = k, and recurse.\n\nNow, translating the dfs function. Fortran doesn't have recursion with the same ease as Java. But Fortran does support recursion, but stack depth can be a problem for large n. However, assuming that the problem constraints are within reasonable limits (as in programming competition problems, perhaps n is up to 1e5, which would cause stack overflow in recursive code). But the original Java code uses recursion, so perhaps the problem expects a recursive solution. But in Fortran, for large n, a recursive approach may hit stack limits. However, since the code is to be translated as is, perhaps proceed with a recursive approach.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the nodes are processed in a depth-first manner. Each child edge is processed, and colors are assigned. So the Fortran code can replicate the same logic with a recursive subroutine.\n\nNow, handling the Edge derived type in Fortran:\n\ntype EdgeType\n  integer :: id\n  integer :: to\nend type EdgeType\n\nThen, the adjacency list is an array of EdgeType arrays. So for each node, a dynamic array of EdgeType elements.\n\nIn Fortran, this can be represented as:\n\ntype EdgeList\n  type(EdgeType), allocatable :: edges(:)\nend type EdgeList\n\ntype(EdgeList), allocatable :: g(:)\n\nThen, for each node i, g(i)%edges is the list of edges.\n\nNow, building the adjacency list:\n\nallocate(g(0:n-1))\ndo i = 0, n-1\n  allocate(g(i)%edges(0)) ! Initially empty\nend do\n\nThen, for each edge input (n-1 edges):\n\ndo i = 0, n-2\n  read a, b from input (after subtracting 1)\n  ! Add edge to a's list\n  call add_edge(g(a), EdgeType(i, b))\n  ! Add edge to b's list\n  call add_edge(g(b), EdgeType(i, a))\nend do\n\nBut how to implement add_edge? In Fortran, since the edges array is allocatable, to append an element, we need to reallocate.\n\nSo, a helper subroutine to append an EdgeType to an EdgeList's edges array:\n\nsubroutine add_edge(list, edge)\n  type(EdgeList), intent(inout) :: list\n  type(EdgeType), intent(in) :: edge\n  type(EdgeType), allocatable :: temp(:)\n  integer :: n\n\n  if (.not. allocated(list%edges)) then\n    allocate(list%edges(1))\n    list%edges(1) = edge\n  else\n    n = size(list%edges)\n    allocate(temp(n+1))\n    temp(1:n) = list%edges\n    temp(n+1) = edge\n    call move_alloc(temp, list%edges)\n  end if\nend subroutine add_edge\n\nBut in the initial code, each node's edges are stored as an array. So during the reading phase, for each edge (a and b), we append to both a and b's lists.\n\nOnce the adjacency list is built, the ans array is allocated as size n-1. Each ans(i) is the color of the i-th edge (0-based).\n\nThen, the main part is to perform the dfs. The dfs function in Java is static, but in Fortran, we need to pass the necessary variables (ans, g) as arguments, or have them in modules.\n\nAlternatively, place ans and g in a module so that the recursive subroutine can access them.\n\nThis is because in Fortran, the recursive subroutine can't directly access variables from the parent scope unless they are passed as arguments or in a module.\n\nSo, perhaps using a module to hold the g and ans variables.\n\nSo, the code structure in Fortran:\n\nmodule global\n  type EdgeType\n    integer :: id\n    integer :: to\n  end type\n\n  type EdgeList\n    type(EdgeType), allocatable :: edges(:)\n  end type\n\n  type(EdgeList), allocatable :: g(:)\n  integer, allocatable :: ans(:)\n  integer :: max_color\nend module\n\nThen, the main program and the recursive subroutine can access these variables via the module.\n\nBut the max_color variable in the Java code is computed as the maximum of the ans array. So after the dfs, iterate through ans to find the maximum.\n\nSo, the main steps in Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n  use global\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i, a, b, max_color\n  type(EdgeType) :: e\n\n  read *, n\n  allocate(g(0:n-1))\n  do i = 0, n-1\n    allocate(g(i)%edges(0)) ! Initialize empty\n  end do\n\n  do i = 0, n-2\n    read *, a, b\n    a = a - 1 ! Convert to 0-based\n    b = b - 1\n    e = EdgeType(i, b)\n    call add_edge(g(a), e)\n    e = EdgeType(i, a)\n    call add_edge(g(b), e)\n  end do\n\n  allocate(ans(0:n-2)) ! ans has n-1 elements, indices 0 to n-2\n  ans = 0\n  call dfs(0, -1, -1) ! to=0, color=-1, parents=-1\n\n  max_color = maxval(ans)\n  print *, max_color\n  do i = 0, n-2\n    print *, ans(i)\n  end do\n\ncontains\n\nsubroutine add_edge(list, edge)\n  type(EdgeList), intent(inout) :: list\n  type(EdgeType), intent(in) :: edge\n  type(EdgeType), allocatable :: temp(:)\n  integer :: n\n\n  if (.not. allocated(list%edges)) then\n    allocate(list%edges(1))\n    list%edges(1) = edge\n  else\n    n = size(list%edges)\n    allocate(temp(n+1))\n    temp(1:n) = list%edges\n    temp(n+1) = edge\n    call move_alloc(temp, list%edges)\n  end if\nend subroutine add_edge\n\nrecursive subroutine dfs(to, color, parents)\n  integer, intent(in) :: to, color, parents\n  integer :: k, i\n  type(EdgeType) :: e\n\n  k = 1\n  do i = 1, size(g(to)%edges)\n    e = g(to)%edges(i)\n    if (e%to == parents) cycle\n    if (k == color) k = k + 1\n    ans(e%id) = k\n    call dfs(e%to, k, to)\n    k = k + 1\n  end do\nend subroutine dfs\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the edges are processed in the order they were added to the adjacency list. So for each node to, the edges are iterated in the order stored in the list. So in Fortran, when building the adjacency list, the order in which edges are added must be preserved.\n\nIn the add_edge subroutine, when appending to the list, each new edge is added to the end. So in the Fortran code, the edges are stored in the order they are added, which matches the Java code's approach.\n\nIn the dfs subroutine, the loop is from i = 1 to size(g(to)%edges), and for each e in g(to)%edges(i). So the edges are processed in the same order as in Java.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop for (Edge e : g.get(to)) processes the edges in the order they were added. So in Fortran, the same order is maintained.\n\nNow, handling the 0-based vs 1-based arrays. For example, in the Fortran code, the adjacency list for node to (0-based) is accessed as g(to)%edges. Each edge in the list is stored in the order they were added, and the loop in the dfs goes from 1 to size(g(to)%edges), which is 1-based. But in Fortran, the edges are stored in 1-based indices.\n\nWait, in the add_edge subroutine, when the list is empty, the first edge is stored at index 1. Then, subsequent edges are added to the end. So the edges array is 1-based. So when looping over the edges, the code uses i = 1 to size(g(to)%edges). That's correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: the EdgeType in Java's code has id and to. The id is the original edge index (from 0 to n-2). So in Fortran's ans array, which is 0-based, the id is correctly stored.\n\nIn the dfs subroutine:\n\nThe loop variable is k, starting at 1. For each edge, if the edge's to is the parent, skip. Otherwise, assign k to the edge's id, but if k equals the parent's color, increment k. Then assign ans[e.id] = k, and call dfs on e.to with color k, and parents as to.\n\nSo in Fortran, the same logic applies.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n1. In Fortran, when passing parameters to a recursive subroutine, all arguments are passed by reference. But the parameters like to, color, parents are integers, which are passed by value. So in the recursive calls, they are copied correctly.\n\n2. The use of the module to share the ans and g variables. This should be okay, as the module variables are accessible within the program and subroutines.\n\n3. The initial allocation of ans as 0-based? No, in Fortran, when you allocate ans(0:n-2), the indices are 0 to n-2. Yes.\n\nTesting the code with sample input.\n\nFor example, the sample input may be:\n\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n\nIn Java, after subtracting 1, the edges are between 0 and 1, and 1 and 2. The adjacency list for each node:\n\n0: edges (0,1) and (0,0) ?\n\nWait, in Java, for each edge input:\n\nFirst edge (i=0): a=1-1=0, b=2-1=1. So add to a's list Edge(0,1) and to b's list Edge(0,0).\n\nSecond edge (i=1): a=2-1=1, b=3-1=2. So add to a's list Edge(1,2) and to b's list Edge(1,1).\n\nSo the adjacency list for 0 has Edge(0,1).\n\nFor node 0's edges:\n\nEdge 0: id=0, to=1.\n\nNode 1's edges:\n\nEdges: id=0, to=0; id=1, to=2; and others?\n\nWait, each time an edge is added, both a and b's lists are updated. So for the first edge (0-1), node 0's list has Edge(0,1), node 1's list has Edge(0,0). For the second edge (1-2), node 1's list has Edge(1,2), node 2's list has Edge(1,1).\n\nSo node 1's adjacency list has two edges: Edge(0,0), Edge(1,2).\n\nThen, when dfs starts at node 0, color -1, parent -1.\n\nk starts at 1. Process each edge in the order they were added.\n\nFirst edge in node 0's list is Edge(0,1) (id=0, to=1). Since parent is -1 (not equal to 1), proceed. k is 1. Since color is -1 (not equal to k), assign ans[0] = 1. Then dfs(1, 1, 0).\n\nIn the dfs(1, 1, 0):\n\nk starts at 1. Process each edge in node 1's list:\n\nFirst edge is Edge(0,0). to=0, which is the parent (0). So skip.\n\nSecond edge is Edge(1,2). to=2, which is not parent. k starts at 1. color is 1 (from the parent's color). So k=1. Since k equals color (1 == 1), increment k to 2. Assign ans[1] =2. Call dfs(2, 2, 1).\n\nIn dfs(2, 2, 1):\n\nCheck edges for node 2. The only edge is Edge(1,1) (to=1, which is the parent. So skip. So no action. Return.\n\nBack to dfs(1,1,0). k increments to 3, but no more edges. So return.\n\nBack to dfs(0,-1,-1). k increments to 2. But no more edges. So the ans array is [1,2], and the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the output is 2 followed by 1 and 2.\n\nWhich matches the expected sample.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the ans array is allocated as ans(0:n-2), which in this case n=3, ans(0:1). The output would be 2, then 1 and 2.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nOther considerations:\n\n- The initial ans array in Fortran is initialized to zero. But in the Java code, the ans array is initialized to zero. So that's correct.\n\n- The maxval function in Fortran returns the maximum value in the array, which in this case is 2.\n\n- The print statements: in Fortran, the first print is the maximum color, then each color in order.\n\nBut in the Java code, the edges are output in the order of their input. The ans array is indexed by edge id (0 to n-2), which corresponds to the input order. So in the Fortran code, looping from 0 to n-2 and printing ans(i) is correct.\n\nNow, potential issues:\n\n1. In Fortran, the indices for the edges in the adjacency list are 1-based. So when looping in the dfs subroutine, i starts from 1. But in the code, the edges are stored in the order of addition, so that's correct.\n\n2. The add_edge subroutine appends the edge to the end of the list. This matches the Java code's behavior of adding to the ArrayList, which appends to the end.\n\n3. The EdgeType in Fortran has id and to components, which are correctly handled.\n\n4. The recursive calls in Fortran: Fortran allows recursive subroutines, but for very large n, this might cause stack overflow. However, the problem is a translation of the original code, which also uses recursion.\n\nAnother thing: in the original Java code, the Edge class has a constructor. In Fortran, the EdgeType is initialized by structure constructors.\n\nNow, testing for another case. For example, n=4, edges:\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\nThe input would be:\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\nIn Java, after subtracting 1, the nodes are 0, 0, 0 for the edges. Each edge id is 0, 1, 2.\n\nThe adjacency list for node 0 (1-based in input) would have edges to 1, 2, 3 (after subtracting 1). But wait, in the input, the edges are between 1-2, 1-3, 1-4. So after subtracting 1, they are 0-1, 0-2, 0-3. So the edges are added to each node's adjacency list.\n\nFor example, edge 0 (id 0) between 0 and 1: added to 0's list as Edge(0,1), and to 1's list as Edge(0,0).\n\nEdge 1 (id 1) between 0 and 2: added to 0's list as Edge(1,2), and to 2's list as Edge(1,0).\n\nEdge 2 (id 2) between 0 and 3: added to 0's list as Edge(2,3), and to 3's list as Edge(2,0).\n\nWhen dfs starts at 0:\n\nk starts at 1. Process each edge in order: Edge0 (to=1), Edge1 (to=2), Edge2 (to=3).\n\nFor each edge:\n\nFirst edge (to=1, parent -1). color is -1, so k=1. Assign ans[0] =1. dfs(1, 1, 0).\n\nIn dfs(1, 1, 0):\n\nedges are Edge0 (to=0, parent is 0, so skip), and any other edges (like if there were any, but in this case, node 1's edges is only Edge0 (to=0) and others added in other edges. But in this example, node 1's edges is only Edge0. So after skipping, no further edges. k is 1.\n\nThen, back to node 0's dfs. k increments to 2. Next edge is Edge1 (to=2). Assign ans[1] =2. dfs(2, 2, 0).\n\nIn dfs(2, 2, 0):\n\nedges are Edge1 (to=0, parent is 0, skip. any other edges? No. So return.\n\nBack to node 0's dfs. k increments to 3. Next edge is Edge2 (to=3). Assign ans[2] =3. dfs(3,3,0).\n\nIn dfs(3,3,0):\n\nedges is Edge2 (to=0), parent is 0, skip. return.\n\nSo the ans array is [1,2,3], max 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle this.\n\nThus, the translation seems correct."
