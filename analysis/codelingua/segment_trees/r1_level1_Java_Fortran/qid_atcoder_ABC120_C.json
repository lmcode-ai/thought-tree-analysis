    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main part of the code is in the solve method of the TaskB class. It reads a string x, uses a stack to process characters, and counts the number of times adjacent characters are '0' and '1' (either order), removing them each time. The final count is multiplied by 2 and printed.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, I'll need to handle input/output. Java uses BufferedReader and PrintWriter, but Fortran can read from standard input. The InputReader class reads tokens, but since the input here is a single string, perhaps we can read the entire line.\n\nThe stack operations: Java's Stack is used to push characters. In Fortran, we can simulate a stack using an array and a pointer to track the top. Let's think: each time a character is pushed, check the top two. If they are different (0 and 1 or 1 and 0), increment the counter and remove both. Otherwise, leave them on the stack.\n\nSo, steps to convert:\n\n1. Read the input string. In Fortran, we can use read(*, '(a)') to read a line.\n\n2. Initialize a stack-like structure. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in stack, we'll use an array of characters and a variable to track the top index. Let's say stack_size starts at 0. When pushing, increment stack_size and assign the character. When popping, decrease stack_size.\n\n3. Iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, push it onto the stack. Then, check the top two elements. If they are different (like '0' and '1' in either order), pop both and increment the counter. This loop continues as long as the stack has at least two elements after pushing.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after pushing a character, there's a while loop that checks if the stack has more than one element. Then, it pops the top two. If they form a 0 and 1 pair, the count increases and the loop continues (so those two are removed). Otherwise, they are pushed back and the loop breaks.\n\nSo the logic is: after pushing a new character, check the top two as long as possible. So in Fortran, for each character:\n\n- push to stack\n- loop while stack size >=2\n   - pop top two elements\n   - if they are different (0 and 1), increment counter\n   - else, push them back and exit loop\n\nBut how to handle the popping and checking in Fortran?\n\nLet's think. The stack is represented by an array. Let's say we have a character array, say, stack(100000), and a integer stack_size.\n\nWhen pushing, stack_size increases by 1, stack(stack_size) = char.\n\nWhen popping, take the top element (stack(stack_size)), then stack_size decreases by 1.\n\nSo in the loop after pushing a character:\n\ndo\n   if (stack_size < 2) exit\n   ! pop top two elements\n   p = stack(stack_size)\n   stack_size = stack_size -1\n   q = stack(stack_size)\n   stack_size = stack_size -1\n   if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '0' .and. q == '1') ) then\n       c = c +1\n       ! do not push them back, so the stack_size is now reduced by 2\n       ! check again if after this removal, the new top two can be popped\n       ! so continue the loop\n   else\n       ! push back q and p\n       stack_size = stack_size +1\n       stack(stack_size) = q\n       stack_size = stack_size +1\n       stack(stack_size) = p\n       exit\n   endif\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, they are not pushed back, so the stack size decreases by 2. Then, the while loop continues, checking again if stack size is >1. Because perhaps the previous elements now form another pair.\n\nFor example, after removing two, maybe the new top two (if any) can be removed again.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after removing two elements (p and q) and incrementing the count, the loop should continue. Because the stack size is now stack_size -2. So the code after popping p and q would have stack_size = stack_size - 2. Then, the loop condition (stack_size >=2) is checked again.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nIn the Java code, after pushing a new character, they have a while loop that runs as long as the stack size is >1. Inside the loop:\n\n- Pop p (top element)\n- Pop q (next element)\n- If p and q are 0 and 1 (either order), increment c, and continue the loop (so the two are removed, and the loop checks again)\n- Else, push q and p back, then break out of the loop.\n\nWait, no. Because after popping p and q, if they form a pair, the code increments c and continues, but then the loop condition is checked again (stack.size() >1). But after removing two elements, the stack size is now s.size() -2. So the loop continues as long as after popping, the size is still >1.\n\nWait, the code inside the loop is:\n\ns.pop() p, s.pop() q.\n\nIf they form a pair, then c is increased. But then the code continues the loop, which checks s.size() >1 again (since after two pops, the stack size is now s.size() -2). So the code is effectively processing the stack by removing pairs as long as possible each time a new element is added.\n\nSo the logic in Fortran needs to be:\n\nFor each character in the input string:\n\n1. Push to stack.\n\n2. Then, loop:\n\n   a. Check if stack size >=2.\n\n   b. If not, exit loop.\n\n   c. Else, pop the top two elements (p and q).\n\n   d. If they are a pair (0 and 1), increment count, and the stack is now two elements shorter. Now, check again if the new top two elements (if any) form a pair. So the loop continues.\n\n   e. If they are not a pair, push them back (q first, then p), and exit the loop.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after pushing a character, we need a loop that continues to check and remove pairs as long as possible. This seems like a while loop in Java, which in Fortran can be implemented as a do-while loop.\n\nWait, the Java code's while loop runs as long as s.size()>1. So in Fortran, after pushing a character, enter a loop that continues processing as long as the stack has at least two elements.\n\nBut the problem is that after popping two elements and increasing the count, the stack size is reduced by two, but then we need to check again if the stack has two elements left (since another pair may be formed). So the loop should run as long as after processing, the stack size is >=2.\n\nWait, but in Java's code:\n\ns.push(x.charAt(i));\n\nwhile (s.size() >1) {\n\n   pop p, pop q.\n\n   if (p and q form a pair) {\n\n       c++;\n\n       // since they are removed, the stack size is now s.size() -2 +1 (since we pushed one, then popped two: initial size is s.size() after push is previous size +1. Then pop two, so size is (prev+1) -2 = prev -1.\n\n       // then loop continues as long as size >1.\n\n   } else {\n\n       push q and p.\n\n       break;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine the Java code again.\n\nJava code steps for each character:\n\n- Push to stack.\n\n- Enter a while loop that runs as long as stack size is greater than 1.\n\nInside the loop:\n\n   Pop p (top element)\n\n   Pop q (now the new top after p is popped)\n\n   Check if p and q are different.\n\n   If yes: increment c, and continue the loop. But the stack size is now (original size after push) -2.\n\n   But since the loop checks s.size()>1, if after the two pops, the stack size is s.size() -2 (from original s.size() after push: which was s.size() = initial stack size before push +1. So after pushing, size is N+1. Then popping two gives N+1-2 = N-1. Then, the loop condition is (N-1) >1? So the loop continues only if N-1>1, i.e., N>2. So this may not capture all possible pairs. Wait, perhaps the Java code's logic isn't exactly capturing all possible adjacent pairs. Let's take an example.\n\nWait, perhaps the Java code is not the most efficient way to process pairs. For example, when a new character is pushed, the code checks the top two. If they form a pair, they are removed, but the loop continues. This allows the code to check the next top two elements again. But how?\n\nLet's take an example:\n\nStack is [0, 1, 0].\n\nPush a new character 1. Stack becomes [0,1,0,1]. Then, enter the loop:\n\nCheck size>1: yes.\n\nPop p=1, pop q=0.\n\nThey are different (0 and 1). Increment c. Now stack is [0,1]. The loop continues, since size is 2>1.\n\nPop p=1, pop q=0. Again different. Increment c. Now stack is empty. The loop condition is now stack.size()>1 (which is 0), so loop exits.\n\nTotal c is 2, multiplied by 2 gives 4. Which is correct, because two pairs were removed.\n\nBut if the code removes the two pairs correctly, then this approach works. So the Java code is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each character added, we process the stack by removing consecutive pairs, possibly multiple times.\n\nSo the Fortran code should process each character in the input string, push it onto the stack, then enter a loop where it checks if there are at least two elements. Pop two, check if they are a pair. If yes, increment count, and the stack is reduced by two, then check again. If not, push them back and exit.\n\nSo, in Fortran code:\n\nInitialize stack as a character array, say, stack(100000), and a variable stack_size.\n\nRead the input string x.\n\nInitialize stack_size to 0.\n\nc = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(x)\n\n   stack_size = stack_size + 1\n\n   stack(stack_size) = x(i:i)\n\n   do\n\n      if (stack_size < 2) exit\n\n      p = stack(stack_size)\n\n      stack_size = stack_size -1\n\n      q = stack(stack_size)\n\n      stack_size = stack_size -1\n\n      if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '0' .and. q == '1') ) then\n\n          c = c +1\n\n          ! since we removed two elements, stack_size is now stack_size -2\n\n          ! check again if there are two elements\n\n      else\n\n          ! push back q and p, in the correct order\n\n          stack_size = stack_size +1\n\n          stack(stack_size) = q\n\n          stack_size = stack_size +1\n\n          stack(stack_size) = p\n\n          exit\n\n      endif\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nprint *, c * 2\n\nBut wait, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, stack_size is reduced by 2. So the new stack_size is stack_size -2. Then, we need to check if there are at least two elements again. So the loop continues. So the inner do loop will check again.\n\nFor example, after processing a pair, stack_size becomes stack_size -2. Then, the next iteration of the inner loop will check if stack_size >=2. If yes, pop again.\n\nBut in the code above, after popping p and q (and stack_size is stack_size-2), the inner loop's 'do' will check again, because the code is in a do loop with no exit condition except the 'if (stack_size <2) exit'.\n\nYes. Because the inner loop is a do loop with no conditions, and the first thing inside is checking if stack_size is <2. If not, proceed.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, handling the stack correctly. The stack array in Fortran can be of a fixed size. Since the input string can be up to 1e5 characters (assuming), the stack needs to handle that. So declaring stack as, say, character(len=1) :: stack(1000000) or something. Alternatively, use an allocatable array. But since in practice, the stack size can't exceed the input length (each character is pushed once), but in the worst case, it's O(n). So for safety, maybe declare a large enough array.\n\nIn the Java code, the output is c * 2. Because each pair removed contributes two characters. So the count is the number of pairs removed, and each pair is two characters. So the total removed is c*2. But in the code, 'c' counts the number of pairs. So multiplying by 2 gives the total characters removed. So the Fortran code just outputs c * 2.\n\nNow, the InputReader class in Java is for reading input. Since the Java code reads the entire string via in.next(), which reads a token. But in the problem statement, the input is a single string (like '0101'), so in Fortran, we can read the entire line.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code can be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=200000) :: x\n    character(len=1), allocatable :: stack(:)\n    integer :: stack_size, c, i, n\n    character(len=1) :: p, q\n\n    read(*, '(a)') x\n    x = adjustl(x)\n    n = len_trim(x)\n    allocate(stack(n))  ! Maximum possible stack size is n\n    stack_size = 0\n    c = 0\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        stack_size = stack_size + 1\n        stack(stack_size) = x(i:i)\n        do\n            if (stack_size < 2) exit\n            p = stack(stack_size)\n            stack_size = stack_size - 1\n            q = stack(stack_size)\n            stack_size = stack_size - 1\n            if ((p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '0' .and. q == '1')) then\n                c = c + 1\n                ! Continue the loop to check for more pairs\n            else\n                ! Push back q and p\n                stack_size = stack_size + 1\n                stack(stack_size) = q\n                stack_size = stack_size + 1\n                stack(stack_size) = p\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    print *, c * 2\nend program main\n\nBut wait, in the Fortran code, when stack_size is incremented, we need to make sure the stack array is large enough. Since we allocated stack(n), and in the worst case, each character is pushed once and not popped, so n is sufficient.\n\nWait, but when pushing back after popping, stack_size can increase. For example, when you have two elements, you pop them, check, and if not a pair, push them back. So stack_size returns to its original value. So in the inner loop, after popping two, if they are not a pair, they are pushed back. So the stack_size remains the same. But in the case where they are a pair, stack_size decreases by 2, and the loop continues.\n\nSo the code should handle that correctly.\n\nTesting the code with sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 0011 \u2192 Output 4.\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nStart with stack empty.\n\ni=1, push '0'. stack_size=1. inner loop not entered.\n\ni=2, push '0'. stack_size=2. enter inner loop:\n\np = '0', stack_size 1.\n\nq = '0', stack_size 0.\n\np and q are both '0's. So push back. stack_size becomes 2 again. exit loop.\n\nc remains 0.\n\ni=3, push '1'. stack_size=3.\n\nenter inner loop:\n\npop '1', stack_size 2.\n\npop '0', stack_size 1.\n\np='1', q='0' \u2192 pair. c=1. stack_size=1. loop continues.\n\nNow stack_size is 1. Exit inner loop.\n\ni=4, push '1'. stack_size=2.\n\nenter inner loop:\n\npop '1', stack_size 1.\n\npop '1', stack_size 0.\n\np and q are '1's \u2192 no. Push back. stack_size becomes 2. exit loop.\n\nc=1. After processing all, output 1*2=2. Wait, but sample input 0011 should output 4. Wait, maybe my example is wrong.\n\nWait original sample input 0011: processing:\n\nEach '0's are pushed. Then when '1's are pushed. Let's see:\n\nAfter i=3 (third character is '1'):\n\nstack is ['0', '0', '1'].\n\nPush '1' \u2192 stack is ['0','0','1','1'].\n\nWait no, the sample input 0011 is four characters. So the code should process as follows:\n\nProcessing '0' (i=1): stack size 1, no inner loop.\n\ni=2: '0' pushed. stack size 2. inner loop pops '0' and '0' \u2192 no pair. So stack size remains 2.\n\ni=3: push '1'. stack size 3.\n\ninner loop:\n\npop '1' (stack size 2), pop '0' (stack size 1). p=1, q=0: pair. c=1. stack size 1.\n\nloop continues. check stack size >=2? 1 is not. Exit. So after i=3, c=1.\n\ni=4: push '1'. stack size 2.\n\ninner loop:\n\npop '1' and '1' \u2192 no. push back. exit. c remains 1.\n\nSo total c*2=2. But sample input 0011's output is 4.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the code isn't working as expected. So where is the error?\n\nWait the sample input for the original problem (ABC120 C) is when the maximum number of pairs can be removed. For example, 0011 can be fully removed: two pairs. So the answer is 4 (since 2 pairs \u00d72=4). But according to the code logic, why does the Java code output 4 for this case?\n\nLet me re-examine the Java code.\n\nWait, in the Java code, when processing '0011':\n\nFirst, each character is pushed. Let's walk through:\n\nInitialize stack is empty.\n\ni=0 (char '0'):\n\npush. stack: [0].\n\nNo inner loop.\n\ni=1 (char '0'):\n\npush. stack: [0,0].\n\nInner loop:\n\npop 0 and 0 \u2192 not a pair. Push back. So stack remains [0,0].\n\ni=2 (char '1'):\n\npush. stack: [0,0,1].\n\nInner loop:\n\npop 1 and 0 \u2192 pair. c=1. stack becomes [0]. Now, stack size is 1, exit loop.\n\ni=3 (char '1'):\n\npush. stack: [0,1].\n\nInner loop:\n\npop 1 and 0 \u2192 pair. c=2. stack becomes empty. loop exits.\n\nTotal c is 2. Output is 2*2=4. Which is correct.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, for this case:\n\ni=1: '0' \u2192 stack_size=1. inner loop no.\n\ni=2: '0' \u2192 stack_size=2. inner loop:\n\npop p=0, q=0. not pair. Push back. stack_size 2. exit.\n\ni=3: '1' \u2192 stack_size=3. inner loop:\n\npop p=1 (stack_size=2), q=0 (stack_size=1). Pair. c=1. stack_size=1.\n\nLoop continues? After popping, stack_size is 1. The inner loop's first check is stack_size >=2? No, so exit. So inner loop exits. Now, stack_size=1.\n\ni=4: '1' \u2192 stack_size=2. inner loop:\n\npop p=1 (stack_size=1), q=1 (stack_size=0). So p=1 and q=1? No, but wait stack was [0,1] after pushing the fourth character.\n\nWait when i=4, the character is '1', pushed to stack (stack_size becomes 2, elements are 0 (from stack_size=1) and 1.\n\nSo stack is [0,1].\n\nInner loop:\n\npop p=1 (stack_size 1), q=0 (stack_size 0).\n\np=1 and q=0: pair. c becomes 2. stack_size=0.\n\nThen loop continues? stack_size=0 <2 \u2192 exit.\n\nSo after processing i=4, c=2. Output is 4.\n\nBut according to the Fortran code as written, would this happen?\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nAfter i=3 (third character, '1'):\n\nstack_size is 3? No, in Fortran, the loop is i=1 to len_trim(x), which is 4 for '0011'.\n\nWait, in the code, x is read as a string. For '0011', len_trim(x) is 4.\n\nSo i runs from 1 to 4.\n\ni=1: '0' pushed. stack_size=1. inner loop not entered.\n\ni=2: '0' pushed. stack_size=2. inner loop entered.\n\np=0 (stack_size 2, popped \u2192 stack_size 1.\n\nq=0 (stack_size 1, popped \u2192 stack_size 0).\n\nCheck if 0 and 0: no. push back q and p. stack_size becomes 0+1=1 (q), then +1=2 (p). exit loop.\n\nc=0.\n\ni=3: '1' pushed. stack_size=3.\n\ninner loop entered.\n\np=1 (stack_size 3 \u2192 2 after pop).\n\nq=0 (stack_size 2 \u2192 1 after pop).\n\nCheck 1 and 0: yes. c=1.\n\nstack_size is now 1.\n\nNow, inner loop continues: check stack_size >=2? 1 <2. exit loop.\n\ni=4: '1' pushed. stack_size=2.\n\nelements are stack(1)=0 (from stack_size=1 after previous step), then pushed '1' makes stack_size=2. So stack(2)=1.\n\ninner loop entered.\n\np=1 (stack_size 2 \u21921 after pop).\n\nq=0 (stack_size 1 \u21920 after pop).\n\nCheck 1 and 0: yes. c becomes 2. stack_size=0.\n\nLoop continues: check stack_size >=2? 0 <2. exit.\n\nSo after all i's, c=2. Output 2*2=4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code works for this case.\n\nAnother test case: input '0101'.\n\nJava code processing:\n\nEach character:\n\ni=0: '0' \u2192 stack [0]\n\ni=1: '1' \u2192 stack [0,1]. Pop 1 and 0 \u2192 pair. c=1. stack empty. loop exits.\n\ni=2: '0' \u2192 stack [0]\n\ni=3: '1' \u2192 stack [0,1]. Pop pair. c=2. stack empty. \n\nTotal c=2 \u2192 output 4.\n\nFortran code would do the same.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother possible problem: stack array allocation. Using a fixed size array may be problematic for large inputs. But the code uses allocate(stack(n)), where n is len_trim(x). So for input length up to 1e5, it's manageable.\n\nIn Fortran, the maximum array size is system-dependent, but assuming the problem constraints are manageable, this should be okay.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code should look like the one I wrote."
