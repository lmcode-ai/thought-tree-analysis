    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main part seems to involve priority queues. The Job class implements Comparable, and the compareTo method sorts first by 'a' ascending, then by 'b' ascending. Then, in the main program, they read N and M. They create a priority queue of Jobs. Then, for each day from 1 to M, they check which jobs have 'a' <= current day and add their 'b' values to another priority queue (max-heap, since it's reverse order). Then take the max 'b' each day and sum them up.\n\nFortran doesn't have built-in priority queues, so I'll need to implement that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe simulate the behavior using arrays and sorting.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read N and M.\n2. Read N pairs of A and B, storing them.\n3. Sort these jobs in a way that we can efficiently get the ones with a <= current day and with the highest b. But how?\n\nThe Java code uses a priority queue (min-heap) for the jobs, sorted by 'a' then 'b'. Then, as days progress from 1 to M, it pulls all jobs where a <= i (current day) and adds their 'b' to a max-heap. Then picks the max each day.\n\nSo, in Fortran, perhaps:\n\n- First, sort the jobs in ascending order of 'a' and then 'b'. Then process them in order. For each day i (from 1 to M), collect all jobs where a <= i. Then among these, select the ones with the largest b values, up to the number of days remaining (but maybe not needed here). But since in Java, for each day, they take the max 'b' from the available jobs that have a <= day.\n\nWait, the Java code's approach is:\n\nFor each day from 1 to M:\n\n- Take all jobs from the priority queue where a <= i (so earliest possible day they can be done). These jobs are added to the jobQ, which is a max-heap of their 'b' values.\n\nThen, each day, they take the max 'b' available and add it to the total.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Sort jobs by a ascending. For each day i, collect all jobs with a <= i. Then pick the job with the highest b that hasn't been taken yet.\n\nBut how to efficiently do this in Fortran?\n\nMaybe:\n\n1. Sort all jobs by a ascending. Then, for each day i from 1 to M, collect all jobs where a <= i. Then, among those, select the maximum b that hasn't been used yet. But this would require, for each day, having a list of eligible jobs and selecting the max. However, if we process the days in order and the jobs in order, perhaps we can maintain a list of eligible jobs and keep track of the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, since in Java they use a priority queue (max-heap) for the eligible 'b's each day, perhaps in Fortran we can do the same by maintaining a sorted list or using a heap structure.\n\nBut since Fortran doesn't have a built-in priority queue, perhaps we can implement a max-heap.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about steps:\n\n- Sort all jobs in ascending order of a. Then, for each job, the earliest day it can be considered is day a. So as we iterate through days from 1 to M, we can collect all jobs where a <= i. Then, among these collected jobs, select the top M jobs with the highest b, but considering that each job can be used once, and each day can take one job.\n\nWait, the problem is similar to scheduling jobs where each job can be done on day i if a <= i, and you can do at most one job per day. The goal is to maximize the sum of b's.\n\nThis is similar to the classic problem where you select jobs that can be scheduled before their deadline, maximizing the profit. The optimal strategy is to sort the jobs by deadline (a) in ascending order, and use a max-heap to track the possible jobs. For each day, add all jobs with a <= current day, then pick the maximum b from them. Since each day can take one job, and the latest possible day for a job is its a value, but the day can be up to M.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Sort the jobs by a ascending.\n\n- Use a max-heap to track the eligible jobs (those with a <= current day).\n\n- For each day i from 1 to M:\n\n   - Add all jobs where a == i to the max-heap.\n\n   - Then, if the heap is not empty, take the maximum b and add to the total.\n\nBut wait, the original Java code adds all jobs with a <= i. So as days increase, more jobs become eligible.\n\nSo, for example, when i is 3, all jobs with a <=3 (i.e., a=1,2,3) are considered. Then the jobQ (max-heap) has all their b's, and each day we take the maximum available.\n\nBut the way the Java code does this is by using a priority queue sorted by a and b, so that when you poll the queue, you get jobs in order of a, then b. But since the jobs are in a priority queue (min-heap for a and b), for each i, they check if the job at the top of the queue has a <=i. If yes, remove it and add its b to the jobQ (max-heap). Repeat until the next job's a >i.\n\nThis way, for each i, all jobs with a <=i are moved into the jobQ, which is a max-heap. Then the jobQ holds all possible eligible jobs, and the maximum is taken each day.\n\nSo in Fortran, how can I replicate this?\n\nIdea: Since the original jobs are processed in a priority queue sorted by a then b, perhaps first sort the jobs in the same order. Then, for each day i from 1 to M:\n\n   - Find all jobs where a <=i and haven't been processed yet. Collect their b's into a max-heap. Then, take the max each day.\n\nBut the order in which the jobs are processed is important. Since the Java code processes them in a priority queue (sorted by a ascending, then b ascending), when you add to the jobQ, you take them in order. So perhaps in Fortran, we can first sort the list of jobs in ascending a, then ascending b.\n\nThen, as we loop through days 1 to M, we keep track of how many jobs we have processed so far (those added to the jobQ). For each day i, we add all jobs from the sorted list where a <=i and haven't been added yet, and add their b to a max-heap. Then, take the max from the max-heap each day.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read N and M.\n\n2. Read N pairs (A, B).\n\n3. Sort the jobs in ascending order of A, then ascending B. Because the Java compareTo sorts by a ascending, then b ascending, so the priority queue will process them in this order.\n\n4. Initialize a max-heap (or a structure to keep track of the maximum B values).\n\n5. Keep a pointer indicating how many jobs have been added to the heap. Initially, pointer is 0.\n\n6. For each day i from 1 to M:\n\n   a. While the pointer is less than N and the current job's A is <=i:\n\n      i. Add the B of this job to the max-heap.\n\n      ii. Increment the pointer.\n\n   b. If the max-heap is not empty, take the max B and add to the total.\n\nSo this way, for each day, we add all jobs with A <=i (but in the order of sorted A and B), then pick the max from those added.\n\nThis approach avoids using a priority queue for the original jobs and instead uses a sorted array and a pointer. The max-heap is needed for the B values.\n\nSo the key challenges are:\n\n- Implementing a max-heap in Fortran.\n\n- Sorting the jobs correctly.\n\nNow, Fortran doesn't have a built-in heap structure. So I need to implement a max-heap.\n\nAlternatively, for the max-heap part, since each time we need to extract the maximum, perhaps we can use an array and keep it sorted in descending order. But inserting into a sorted array would be O(n) time each insertion. For N up to 1e5, this would be slow. So better to implement a heap.\n\nAlternatively, since N can be up to 1e5 (as in programming contests), but in the original code, the problem could have N up to whatever. But the original code uses Java's PriorityQueue, which is O(log n) for insertions and extracts.\n\nSo to handle it efficiently, I need to implement a heap-based structure.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a max-heap for the B values.\n\nImplement functions to insert into the heap and extract the maximum.\n\nThen, the code structure would be:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nRead N pairs of A and B into an array.\n\nSort the array by A ascending, then B ascending.\n\nInitialize the max-heap.\n\nInitialize a pointer to 1 (or 0, depending on 1-based or 0-based array).\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to M:\n\n   while (pointer <= N and array(pointer)%a <= i):\n\n       insert array(pointer)%b into the max-heap\n\n       pointer = pointer +1\n\n   if (heap is not empty):\n\n       total = total + extract_max()\n\nAt the end, print total.\n\nSo, the main parts are:\n\n- Sorting the jobs.\n\n- Implementing the max-heap.\n\nLet's tackle the sorting first.\n\nIn Fortran, we can define a derived type for the jobs.\n\nType Job\n\n   integer :: a, b\n\nEnd Type\n\nThen, create an array of Job.\n\nTo sort them by a ascending, then b ascending, we can use a custom sort. For example, using the built-in sort with a comparator.\n\nBut Fortran's sort functions (like those in the intrinsic module) may not be directly available. Alternatively, we can implement a quick sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in sorting with a custom comparison.\n\nBut for simplicity, perhaps using a custom quicksort.\n\nAlternatively, using the Fortran 2003's intrinsic modules.\n\nWait, Fortran 2003 has the ability to sort an array using a user-defined comparison function via the 'sort' function in the 'iso_fortran_env' module? Not sure. Maybe it's easier to implement a custom sort.\n\nAlternatively, for code brevity, use the 'sorted' approach by generating an index array and using the minloc approach. But for N up to say 1e5, that would be O(n^2) which is not feasible.\n\nSo, need to implement a quicksort.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in sort with a custom key.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to sort the array of Jobs by A, then B.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe can write a subroutine to sort the array of Jobs.\n\nThe comparator function would return true if job1 should come before job2.\n\nIn the Java code, the compareTo is:\n\nif (other.a == this.a) return this.b - other.b (so ascending b), else return this.a - other.a (ascending a).\n\nSo the sorted order is ascending a, then ascending b.\n\nThus, in the sort, we need to arrange the jobs in such a way.\n\nSo in Fortran, when comparing two jobs:\n\nif (a1 < a2) then job1 comes before job2.\n\nif (a1 == a2) and (b1 < b2), then job1 comes before job2.\n\nThus, in the sort, the array is sorted in this order.\n\nOnce sorted, we can proceed.\n\nNow, for the max-heap.\n\nImplementing a max-heap in Fortran.\n\nA max-heap can be implemented using an array where each parent node is larger than its children.\n\nThe operations needed are:\n\n- Insert: add a new element to the end and sift up.\n\n- ExtractMax: remove the root, replace with the last element, and sift down.\n\nSo, here's how to implement it.\n\nIn Fortran, we can represent the heap as an array, say, heap, with a size variable.\n\nInitially, the heap is empty.\n\nInsert: append the element to the end of the heap array, then compare with parent and swap upwards until the parent is larger.\n\nExtractMax: take the first element (max), replace it with the last element, reduce the heap size by 1, then sift down: compare with children and swap with the larger child until the heap property is restored.\n\nSo, let's code this.\n\nBut how to handle dynamic arrays in Fortran? Since the heap can grow up to N elements, we can preallocate an array of size N, and track the current size.\n\nSo, variables:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: heap(:)\n\ninteger :: heap_size = 0\n\nThen, for insertion:\n\nsubroutine heap_insert(value)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: value\n\n   heap_size = heap_size + 1\n\n   if (heap_size > size(heap)) then\n\n       ! need to reallocate. But perhaps allocate initially to N.\n\n       ! So when initializing, allocate heap(N) once.\n\n   end if\n\n   heap(heap_size) = value\n\n   ! sift up\n\n   integer :: current = heap_size\n\n   integer parent\n\n   do while (current > 1)\n\n       parent = current / 2\n\n       if (heap(parent) >= heap(current)) exit\n\n       swap heap(parent) and heap(current)\n\n       current = parent\n\n   end do\n\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in a max-heap, the parent should be >= children. So during insertion, the new element is placed at the end and sifted up by comparing with parents. If the parent is smaller, swap.\n\nSo in the sift up loop:\n\ncurrent starts at heap_size.\n\nCompare with parent (current/2). If parent is smaller than current, swap.\n\nSo the code for sift up is:\n\ncurrent = heap_size\n\ndo while (current > 1)\n\n   parent = current / 2\n\n   if (heap(parent) >= heap(current)) exit\n\n   ! swap parent and current\n\n   temp = heap(parent)\n\n   heap(parent) = heap(current)\n\n   heap(current) = temp\n\n   current = parent\n\nend do\n\nFor extract_max:\n\nfunction extract_max() result(max_val)\n\n   integer :: max_val\n\n   if (heap_size == 0) error...\n\n   max_val = heap(1)\n\n   heap(1) = heap(heap_size)\n\n   heap_size = heap_size - 1\n\n   ! sift down\n\n   integer :: current =1\n\n   do while (current*2 <= heap_size)\n\n       child = current *2\n\n       if (child < heap_size) then\n\n           if (heap(child+1) > heap(child)) then\n\n               child = child +1\n\n           end if\n\n       end if\n\n       if (heap(current) >= heap(child)) exit\n\n       ! swap current and child\n\n       temp = heap(current)\n\n       heap(current) = heap(child)\n\n       heap(child) = temp\n\n       current = child\n\n   end do\n\nend function\n\nSo, in Fortran code:\n\nWe need to manage the heap as an array, with heap_size indicating the current number of elements.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, read N and M.\n\nThen, read N lines of A and B, store as array of Jobs.\n\nSort the array of Jobs in ascending order of a, then ascending b.\n\nThen, initialize the heap with size N (allocate to N), and heap_size=0.\n\nInitialize a pointer to 1 (since Fortran arrays are 1-based).\n\nInitialize total to 0.\n\nLoop for i from 1 to M:\n\n   while (pointer <= N and jobs(pointer)%a <=i):\n\n       call heap_insert(jobs(pointer)%b)\n\n       pointer = pointer +1\n\n   if (heap_size >0):\n\n       total = total + extract_max()\n\nAt the end, print total.\n\nNow, possible edge cases: if multiple jobs have the same a and b, but the sorting handles it.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nBut how to handle the Job array.\n\nDeclare a type:\n\ntype Job\n\n   integer :: a, b\n\nend type Job\n\nThen, allocate an array of Job:\n\ntype(Job), allocatable :: jobs(:)\n\nRead N and M:\n\nread(*,*) N, M\n\nThen, read N lines:\n\nallocate(jobs(N))\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   read(*,*) jobs(i)%a, jobs(i)%b\n\nend do\n\nSort the jobs array.\n\nImplement a quicksort for the jobs array based on a and b.\n\nSo, write a quicksort subroutine.\n\nBut implementing quicksort in Fortran is a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, use a simple bubble sort, but that's O(n^2), which is not feasible for large N. But in the problem, perhaps N is up to 1e5, so O(n log n) is needed.\n\nBut for code submission, perhaps using a built-in sort.\n\nWait, Fortran 2003 introduced the 'sort' function? Not that I know. So I need to implement a sort.\n\nSo, writing a quicksort for the Job array.\n\nThe quicksort partition function will compare two Jobs.\n\nThe comparison is:\n\njob1 <= job2 if:\n\njob1%a < job2%a, or (job1%a == job2%a and job1%b <= job2%b)\n\nSo, in the quicksort partition, we can select a pivot and partition the array.\n\nAlternatively, use a recursive quicksort.\n\nBut implementing quicksort is time-consuming. Alternatively, use the built-in sort with a custom comparator via the 'sort' intrinsic, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use an array of indices and sort them based on the keys, but again, it's a bit involved.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, use the Fortran 2008's 'sort' intrinsic. Wait, I think there's no such intrinsic. So, perhaps the easiest way is to use a straightforward but O(n^2) algorithm, but given that in practice, for programming contests, N could be up to 1e5, so O(n^2) is not feasible. But the original Java code uses a priority queue, which is O(n log n). So in Fortran, need an O(n log n) sort.\n\nThus, implement a quicksort.\n\nHere's an outline of the quicksort implementation for the Job array.\n\nrecursive subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n\n   type(Job), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n\n   if (low < high) then\n\n       integer :: p\n\n       p = partition(arr, low, high)\n\n       call quicksort(arr, low, p-1)\n\n       call quicksort(arr, p+1, high)\n\n   end if\n\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nfunction partition(arr, low, high) result(pivot)\n\n   type(Job), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n\n   type(Job) :: pivot_elem\n\n   integer :: i, j\n\n   pivot_elem = arr(high)\n\n   i = low -1\n\n   do j = low, high-1\n\n       if (compare(arr(j), pivot_elem)) then\n\n           i = i +1\n\n           call swap(arr(i), arr(j))\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\n   call swap(arr(i+1), arr(high))\n\n   pivot = i+1\n\nend function partition\n\nlogical function compare(j1, j2)\n\n   type(Job), intent(in) :: j1, j2\n\n   if (j1%a < j2%a) then\n\n       compare = .true.\n\n   else if (j1%a == j2%a) then\n\n       compare = j1%b <= j2%b\n\n   else\n\n       compare = .false.\n\n   end if\n\nend function compare\n\nsubroutine swap(j1, j2)\n\n   type(Job), intent(inout) :: j1, j2\n\n   type(Job) :: tmp\n\n   tmp = j1\n\n   j1 = j2\n\n   j2 = tmp\n\nend subroutine swap\n\nSo, in the main program:\n\nafter reading N and M, and the jobs array, we call:\n\ncall quicksort(jobs, 1, N)\n\nBut wait, the quicksort subroutine is recursive and takes low and high as parameters.\n\nWait, the initial call would be:\n\ncall quicksort(jobs, 1, N)\n\nBut the subroutine's first line is:\n\nrecursive subroutine quicksort(arr, low, high)\n\n   type(Job), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: low, high\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nOnce the jobs are sorted, proceed.\n\nThen, allocate the heap array to size N.\n\ninteger, allocatable :: heap(:)\n\nallocate(heap(N))\n\nheap_size =0\n\npointer =1\n\ntotal=0\n\nThen, loop for i from 1 to M:\n\n   do while (pointer <= N .and. jobs(pointer)%a <=i)\n\n       call heap_insert(heap, jobs(pointer)%b)\n\n       pointer = pointer +1\n\n   end do\n\n   if (heap_size >0) then\n\n       total = total + extract_max(heap)\n\n   end if\n\nBut need to implement heap_insert and extract_max as subroutines or functions.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions return values, so extract_max can be a function that returns the max value.\n\nBut the heap array and heap_size need to be modified, so they need to be passed as arguments.\n\nAlternatively, use a module to hold heap and heap_size.\n\nBut for simplicity in the code, perhaps pass them as arguments.\n\nSo, the heap_insert subroutine would take the heap array and heap_size as inout variables.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are passed by reference, so modifying them inside the subroutine affects the caller.\n\nBut since the heap is an array that's part of a module or in the main program, perhaps it's better to have a module.\n\nAlternatively, pass the heap array and heap_size as arguments.\n\nSo, the heap_insert subroutine:\n\nsubroutine heap_insert(heap, heap_size, value)\n\n   integer, intent(inout) :: heap(:)\n\n   integer, intent(inout) :: heap_size\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: value\n\n   integer :: current, parent\n\n   heap_size = heap_size +1\n\n   heap(heap_size) = value\n\n   current = heap_size\n\n   do while (current >1)\n\n       parent = current /2\n\n       if (heap(parent) >= heap(current)) exit\n\n       call swap_elements(heap, parent, current)\n\n       current = parent\n\n   end do\n\nend subroutine\n\nsubroutine swap_elements(heap, i, j)\n\n   integer, intent(inout) :: heap(:)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: i, j\n\n   integer :: temp\n\n   temp = heap(i)\n\n   heap(i) = heap(j)\n\n   heap(j) = temp\n\nend subroutine\n\nSimilarly, the extract_max function:\n\ninteger function extract_max(heap, heap_size)\n\n   integer, intent(inout) :: heap(:)\n\n   integer, intent(inout) :: heap_size\n\n   integer :: current, child, max_val\n\n   if (heap_size <1) then\n\n       !

The first two jobs (a=1). Insert 1 and 2 into the max-heap.\n\nMax is 2. Total=2.\n\nDay 2:\n\nCheck if any remaining jobs. The third job has a=2 <=2. Add 3. Heap has 2,1,3. Max is3. Total=5.\n\nDay3: i=3. All jobs already added. Heap has 2,1. Max is2. Total=7.\n\nDay4: i=4. Heap has 1. Max is1. Total=8. Wait, but sample output is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's re-express the original problem.\n\nIn the original Java code, for each day i in 1..M, they collect all jobs with a <=i, add their b to a max-heap. Then, take the max.\n\nSample input:\n\n3 jobs:\n\nA=1, B=1\n\nA=1, B=2\n\nA=2, B=3\n\nM=4 days.\n\nSo:\n\nDay1:\n\nJobs with a <=1: all three? No, wait the first two jobs have a=1, the third has a=2. So for day1, a=1 <=1.\n\nSo in Java code:\n\nWhen i=1, the priority queue has jobs sorted by a ascending and b ascending. The first job is (1,1). a=1 <=1: added to jobQ. Then, next job (1,2) is added. Then the next job is (2,1)? Wait, no, the third job is (2,3). So a=2>1. So jobQ has 1,2. Max is 2. Total=2.\n\nDay 2:\n\ni=2. Check jobs with a <=2. The third job (a=2) is added to jobQ. Now jobQ has 1,2,3. Max is3. Total=5.\n\nDay3: i=3. No new jobs (all added). jobQ has 1,2. Max is2. Total=7.\n\nDay4: i=4. jobQ has 1. Max is1. Total=8.\n\nBut sample output is 6. So perhaps the sample input is different.\n\nWait, maybe I have the sample input wrong. Let me check.\n\nAh, the original code's input has lines split by \" \\u2581 \", which is a Unicode character (LOWER ONE EIGHTH BLOCK). But the user probably intended to split by spaces. So perhaps in the input, the first line is \"3 4\" and then three lines like \"1 1\", etc.\n\nBut according to the sample input provided by the user:\n\nSample input:\n\n3 4\n\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\nThe sample output should be 3+2+1=6? How?\n\nWait, perhaps the M is the number of days, but the jobs can only be done up to their a-th day. For example, a job with a=2 can be done on day 1 or 2.\n\nWait, the problem is similar to scheduling jobs where each job can be done at most once, and on any day up to a. The goal is to maximize the sum of B.\n\nSo for the sample input:\n\n3 jobs:\n\na=1: can be done on day1.\n\na=1: can be done on day1.\n\na=2: can be done on day1 or 2.\n\nM=4 days: days 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut each job can be done once.\n\nThe optimal selection is:\n\nDay4: no jobs, since all jobs have a <=2.\n\nWait, but the code in Java would process for each day i from 1 to M.\n\nSo for i=1:\n\nAvailable jobs are all with a <=1: first two jobs. Take max b=2.\n\nDay1: sum +=2.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nAvailable jobs are third job (a=2). Take b=3. sum=5.\n\nFor i=3:\n\nNo jobs left. sum remains 5.\n\nFor i=4: same as i=3. sum 5.\n\nSo total is 5. But sample output is 6.\n\nHmm, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code uses M as the number of days, but each job can be done on any day up to M, but their a is the number of days after which the job can be done.\n\nWait, the problem statement is not provided, but the code seems to accept jobs where a <= current day (i), and for each day, select one job with maximum b.\n\nSo for the sample input:\n\n3 jobs:\n\njob1: a=1, b=1\n\njob2: a=1, b=2\n\njob3: a=2, b=3\n\nM=4.\n\nProcessing each day from 1 to4.\n\nDay1: add jobs with a <=1 (jobs1, job2). Take max b=2. sum=2.\n\nDay2: add jobs with a <=2 (job3). Take max b=3. sum=5.\n\nDay3: no jobs left. sum remains 5.\n\nDay4: no jobs left. sum remains5.\n\nBut sample output is 6. So this suggests that the sample input is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\n3 3\n\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\nThen the output would be 2+3=5 (days 1 and 2), but not sure.\n\nBut this indicates that perhaps there is a mistake in the sample input or in the code.\n\nBut regardless, the code provided by the user is to be translated.\n\nSo, in the Fortran code, the logic follows the Java code.\n\nNow, the Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java code.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in the heap implementation.\n\nFor example, in the Java code, the jobQ is a max-heap, which is implemented via a priority queue with reverse order.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the heap is a max-heap, so when we insert a new element, it's placed in the correct position.\n\nAnother possible mistake is in the sorting of the jobs.\n\nIn the Java code, the priority queue orders the jobs by a ascending, then b ascending. So the jobs are processed in the order of increasing a, then increasing b.\n\nThus, when jobs are added to the jobQ in the Java code, they are taken from the priority queue in order of a, then b. So the first job with the smallest a is processed first.\n\nIn the Fortran code, after sorting the jobs array in ascending a and ascending b, the pointer moves from the first job to the last. So jobs are added in the same order as in the Java code.\n\nSo the Fortran code should correctly emulate the Java code.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in the quicksort's compare function.\n\nIn the compare function:\n\nif j1%a < j2%a: j1 comes first.\n\nif j1%a == j2%a: if j1%b <= j2%b: j1 comes first.\n\nYes, which corresponds to ascending a then ascending b.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fortran code should correctly implement the algorithm, and the steps are as outlined."
