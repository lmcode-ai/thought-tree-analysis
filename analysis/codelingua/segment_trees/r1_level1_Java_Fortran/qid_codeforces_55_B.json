So in Fortran, assuming 1-based indexing, for the current array, say, arr(1:n), the loops would be i from 1 to n-1, j from i+1 to n. Then, the new array would have (n-2) elements from the original array (excluding i and j), plus the combined result.",

So for each pair (i,j) where i < j, the elements to keep are those not equal to i or j. So in Fortran, to collect those elements, we can loop through the current array indices, and for each index k, check if k is not equal to i and j, then add to the new array.

So if the input for the operations is given as, e.g., \"+ * *\", each operation is a single character. So in Fortran, the 'read' statement would need to read each as a single character. So in the input, the user must enter each operation as a single character, possibly separated by spaces. Yes, that's correct. So for the three operations, the input line could be \"+ * +\".",

For n=3, when idx=1, temp is size 1, and new_arr is size 2. Wait, when n=3 (current size is 3), the pair (i,j) loops i from 1 to 2, j from i+1 to 3. For each pair, temp is allocated as n-2 = 1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's look at the Java code first. The main goal is to find the minimal possible value after applying three operations on four numbers. The operations can be either addition or multiplication, and each step combines two numbers into one, using the operation. So after three steps, there's one number left, and we want the minimum of that.\n\nFirst, the Java code uses a recursive approach. The 'util' function seems to handle the permutations of combining the numbers. For each step, it picks two numbers, applies the current operation (either '+' or '*'), and then recursively proceeds with the new list that has one fewer element.\n\nLet's think about the data structures. In Java, they use an ArrayList to hold the numbers. In Fortran, I can use arrays or maybe allocatable arrays. But Fortran's arrays are fixed size unless using allocatable. Wait, but since in each step the array size reduces by one, perhaps using a list-like structure might be challenging. Alternatively, since the original list starts with four elements, and each step reduces by one, maybe we can manage with passing the current elements in a size-appropriate array.\n\nWait, the initial array has 4 elements. Then, after combining two elements, the next array has 3 elements, then 2, then 1. So for each recursive call, the size is 4 - idx. Wait, the 'idx' starts at 0 and goes to 3. So when idx is 0, the size is 4; after combining, it's 3. Then idx increments to 1, size 3, combine to 2. Then idx 2, size 2, combine to 1. Then idx 3, check the value.\n\nSo perhaps in Fortran, we can represent the current list as an array of varying size. But Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays in the same way. So maybe for each recursive step, we need to pass the current elements as an array, but how to handle the varying sizes? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured to use a fixed-size array and track the current number of elements. For example, in the initial call, the array has 4 elements. Then, when combining two elements, we create a new array with 3 elements, where two of them are the remaining elements not combined, and the third is the result. Then, in the next step, process the 3 elements, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, they create a new ArrayList each time. For example, in the loop for i and j (the two elements to combine), they create a new list 'a' that contains all elements except i and j, then add the result of combining i and j. So the new list's size is (current size -1) each step.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps I can represent the list as an array, and for each step, generate all possible pairs, combine them, create the new array with the remaining elements plus the result, and recurse. But since Fortran doesn't have built-in dynamic arrays, maybe using allocatable arrays would be the way to go. However, handling allocatable arrays in recursive functions might be tricky, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, since the depth of recursion is only 3 steps (from idx 0 to 3), maybe we can precompute the possible array sizes. For example, the first step starts with 4 elements, then 3, then 2, then 1. So for each level of recursion, the array has a fixed size. So for each step:\n\n- At idx=0: 4 elements \u2192 3 elements after combining.\n- At idx=1: 3 elements \u2192 2 elements after combining.\n- At idx=2: 2 elements \u2192 1 element after combining.\n- At idx=3: check the value.\n\nSo maybe, for each level, pass the array with the appropriate size. But how to handle this in Fortran? Because Fortran functions and subroutines require the dummy arguments to have declared dimensions. Unless we use assumed-size arrays or pass the array along with its current size. For example, each recursive call would pass the array and the current size.\n\nWait, maybe for each level, the size is known based on idx. Since when idx is 0, the size is 4; when idx is 1, size is 3; idx 2, size 2; idx 3, size 1. Wait, no. Because when you start with 4 elements, after combining two, the next step has 3 elements. Then combining two of those three gives a new array of 2 elements. Then combining those two gives the final element. So the size at each step is (4 - idx). For example:\n\nidx=0 \u2192 size 4 (before combining)\nAfter combining, next idx=1, size is 3.\n\nSo for each call to util, the current array has size (4 - idx). So in Fortran, the subroutine can take an array of size (4 - idx) and the current idx. Then, for each pair in the array, combine them, create a new array of size (3 - idx) (since 4 - idx -1 = 3 - idx), and call the subroutine with idx+1.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to handle each level with arrays of specific sizes.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nOriginal Java code's 'util' function takes an ArrayList, the operations array, and the current index. For each possible pair (i,j) in the current list, it creates a new list that excludes i and j, adds the result of their combination, and recursively calls util with the new list and idx+1.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps the 'util' subroutine will take an array of current numbers, their count (which is 4 - idx), the operations array, and the current idx. Then, for each pair (i,j), create a new array with the other elements plus the result of combining i and j, and call util with idx+1.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are passed with their dimensions. So for each level, we need to have the correct size. For example, when idx=0, the array has 4 elements. For each pair (i,j), the new array will have 3 elements. So in the recursive call for idx=1, the array passed has 3 elements.\n\nBut how to handle dynamic arrays in Fortran for recursion? Well, Fortran 2003 and later support recursive subroutines and allocatable arrays. So perhaps using allocatable arrays would work.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the code can handle creating new arrays for each combination of pairs. Let's think about how to implement the pair selection.\n\nIn Java, for each i from 0 to size-1, j from i+1 to size-1. Then, create a new list that includes all elements except i and j, then add the result. So in Fortran, for each pair (i,j), where i < j, we can loop i from 1 to n-1, j from i+1 to n (assuming 1-based indexing). Then, create a new array of size (n-1) elements (since original size is n, removing two elements and adding one gives n-1 elements).\n\nWait, original array has n elements. For a pair i and j (two distinct elements), the new array is n-2 elements (excluding i and j) plus the combined result, making (n-2 +1) = n-1 elements. But wait, in the Java code, the new ArrayList 'a' is created by adding all elements except i and j, then adding the result. So the size of 'a' is (original size - 2 + 1) = original size -1. So yes.\n\nIn the first step, original size is 4. After combining two elements, the new size is 3 (4-1). Then, next step is size 3, combine two, new size 2, etc.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, for the current array of size 'current_size' (which is 4 - idx), we need to generate all possible pairs (i,j), i < j, and for each, create a new array of size (current_size - 1) = (4 - idx) -1 = 3 - idx. Then, call the subroutine with idx+1 and the new array.\n\nBut how to create the new array in Fortran? Let's think.\n\nFor example, in the current array of size n, when combining elements at positions i and j (assuming 1-based indices?), the new array would consist of all elements except those at positions i and j, plus the result. Wait, in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (i=0; i < arr.size(); i++) {\n   for (j=i+1; j < arr.size(); j++) {\n       create a new list 'a' which includes all elements except i and j, then add res.\n\nSo for each pair (i,j) where i < j, the new list 'a' is made by copying all elements except those at positions i and j, and then adding the result of combining arr[i] and arr[j].\n\nSo in Fortran, assuming 1-based indexing, for the current array, say, arr(1:n), the loops would be i from 1 to n-1, j from i+1 to n. Then, the new array would have (n-2) elements from the original array (excluding i and j), plus the combined result. Wait, but n-2 elements plus one is n-1. So the new array is of size (n-1).\n\nWait, let's take n=4. For i=1, j=2, the new array would have elements 3,4, then the result of combining 1 and 2. So new array size is 3 (4-1). So yes.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i and j, the new array is constructed by taking all elements except those at positions i and j, then adding the result. But how to collect those elements? For example, in the original array of size 4, elements are [a1, a2, a3, a4]. When combining a1 and a2, the new array would be [a3, a4, res].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the Java code's loop for k in arr.size() adds elements where k is not i and not j. So for k from 0 to arr.size()-1, if k != i and k != j, add to a. So in the example where i=0 and j=1 (Java is 0-based), the elements added are those at positions 2 and 3 (a3 and a4 in 1-based), then the result. So the new array is [a3, a4, res].\n\nIn Fortran, assuming 1-based indices, when i=1 and j=2, the elements to keep are those where k is not i and not j, i.e., 3 and 4. So the new array would be [a3, a4, res].\n\nSo for each pair (i,j) where i < j, the elements to keep are those not equal to i or j. So in Fortran, to collect those elements, we can loop through the current array indices, and for each index k, check if k is not equal to i and j, then add to the new array. But since the new array's size is (n-1), the elements not i and j are (n-2) elements, plus the result, making (n-1) elements.\n\nSo the steps for generating the new array:\n\n1. Initialize a new array of size (current_size -1).\n\n2. Collect the elements from the current array except those at positions i and j. These will be (current_size - 2) elements.\n\n3. Compute the result of combining the elements at i and j.\n\n4. Add the result to the new array. Now the new array has (current_size -1) elements.\n\nThen, pass this new array to the recursive call with idx+1.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each pair (i,j), we need to create this new array. Since Fortran allows for array constructors, maybe we can construct the new array by first copying the elements that are not i and j, then appending the result.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think. Suppose current array is arr of size n. For example, n=4. We need to create a new array that contains all elements except arr(i) and arr(j), then add the result.\n\nLet me see. For example, if the elements are [a, b, c, d], and i=1, j=2, then the elements to keep are c and d. Then, the new array is [c, d, res].\n\nSo the new array can be constructed by:\n\nnew_array = [arr(3), arr(4), res]\n\nBut how to collect the elements except i and j in the general case?\n\nAn approach is to create a temporary array that holds all elements except i and j, then add the result. But in Fortran, you can't dynamically append elements unless using array operations. Wait, but if you know the indices to exclude, you can create a list.\n\nAlternatively, loop through all elements and collect those not at i or j. Let's see:\n\nFor the current array arr of size n, and pair (i,j), the new array (before adding res) has size n-2. Then, adding res gives size n-1.\n\nSo for the elements not i or j:\n\ntemp = [arr(1), ..., arr(i-1), arr(i+1), ..., arr(j-1), arr(j+1), ..., arr(n)]\n\nBut this is complicated. Another way: loop through each element k from 1 to n. If k is not i and not j, include it in the temp array.\n\nSo for k in 1 to n:\n\nif k /= i and k /= j, then add to temp.\n\nBut since i and j are in 1-based indices, and i < j, then j is at least i+1.\n\nSo in Fortran, for a given i and j, the elements to be included are those with indices less than i, between i and j, and greater than j. Wait, no. For example, in indices 1,2,3,4, if i=2 and j=3, the elements to include are 1 and 4.\n\nSo the elements not in i or j are [1,4].\n\nSo the temp array would be all elements of arr except arr(i) and arr(j).\n\nHow to collect them in Fortran?\n\nWell, one approach is to create a temporary array of size n-2, then fill it by iterating over the original array and picking elements not at i or j.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger :: m\ninteger, allocatable :: temp(:)\n\nm = 1\ndo k = 1, n\n   if (k /= i .and. k /= j) then\n       temp(m) = arr(k)\n       m = m + 1\n   end if\nend do\n\nThen, the new array is [temp, res].\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can't concatenate arrays with a scalar directly. So you have to create a new array of size (size(temp) + 1) and assign the elements.\n\nSo for example:\n\nallocate(new_arr(size(temp)+1))\nnew_arr(1:size(temp)) = temp\nnew_arr(size(temp)+1) = res\n\nBut since temp is of size n-2 (n being the original array size), the new array is (n-2) +1 = n-1 elements.\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting this together, for each pair (i,j), we:\n\n- Create temp array by excluding arr(i) and arr(j).\n\n- Compute res as either arr(i) + arr(j) or arr(i) * arr(j), depending on the current operation.\n\n- Create new_arr by combining temp and res.\n\n- Then, recursively call the subroutine with new_arr, operations, and idx+1.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the subroutine would need to handle arrays of different sizes at each level. Also, the min variable is a global variable in the Java code. In Fortran, we can have a module variable to hold the minimum value, which is initialized to a very large number, and updated during recursion.\n\nBut Fortran modules have their own scope. So perhaps using a module to hold the min value would be appropriate.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Create a module to hold the min variable.\n\n- The main program reads the four numbers and the three operations.\n\n- Then, calls the recursive subroutine with the initial array (size 4), operations, and idx=0.\n\n- The recursive subroutine processes all pairs, generates new arrays, and updates the min value when idx reaches 3.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, the module:\n\nmodule globals\n   implicit none\n   integer(kind=8) :: min_val\nend module globals\n\nThen, the main program:\n\nprogram codeforces_55_B\n   use globals\n   implicit none\n   integer(kind=8), dimension(4) :: arr\n   character(len=1), dimension(3) :: ops\n   integer :: i\n\n   min_val = huge(0_8)  ! Initialize to maximum possible value\n\n   ! Read input\n   read(*, *) arr\n   read(*, *) ops\n\n   call util(arr, 4, ops, 0)\n\n   print *, min_val\n\nend program codeforces_55_B\n\nWait, but in Fortran, reading the input might need to be done as four separate numbers. The Java code reads four longs and three strings. So the input is four numbers, then three operations (each is either \"+\" or \"*\").\n\nIn Fortran, reading the four numbers can be done with a single read statement, like 'read(*,*) arr', assuming the input is four numbers on a line. Similarly for the operations: read(*,*) ops(1), ops(2), ops(3), assuming they are entered on the same line or separate lines.\n\nBut the user input could vary. But the Java code uses Scanner which splits on whitespace, so the input could be entered as four numbers on one line, followed by three strings on another line, or all on the same line.\n\nBut in Fortran, the 'read' statement will read the numbers as per the format, so assuming the user enters the four numbers, then the three operations.\n\nNow, the 'util' subroutine needs to be recursive. Let's write its skeleton.\n\nrecursive subroutine util(current_arr, n, ops, idx)\n   use globals\n   implicit none\n   integer(kind=8), dimension(n), intent(in) :: current_arr\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n   character(len=1), dimension(3), intent(in) :: ops\n   integer, intent(in) :: idx\n\n   integer :: i, j, k, m, new_size\n   integer(kind=8) :: res\n   integer(kind=8), allocatable :: temp(:), new_arr(:)\n\n   if (idx == 3) then\n      if (current_arr(1) < min_val) then\n         min_val = current_arr(1)\n      end if\n      return\n   end if\n\n   do i = 1, n-1\n      do j = i+1, n\n         ! Create temp array by excluding i and j elements\n         allocate(temp(n-2))\n         m = 1\n         do k = 1, n\n            if (k /= i .and. k /= j) then\n               temp(m) = current_arr(k)\n               m = m + 1\n            end if\n         end do\n\n         ! Compute res\n         if (ops(idx+1) == '+') then\n             res = current_arr(i) + current_arr(j)\n         else\n             res = current_arr(i) * current_arr(j)\n         end if\n\n         ! Create new_arr\n         new_size = n - 1\n         allocate(new_arr(new_size))\n         new_arr(1:n-2) = temp\n         new_arr(n-1) = res\n\n         ! Recursive call\n         call util(new_arr, new_size, ops, idx+1)\n\n         ! Deallocate temp and new_arr to avoid memory leaks\n         deallocate(temp)\n         deallocate(new_arr)\n      end do\n   end do\n\nend subroutine util\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the indices for ops are 1-based. In the Java code, the operations are stored in ops[0], ops[1], ops[2]. So when idx is 0, we use ops[0], which in Fortran is ops(1). So the current operation is ops(idx+1).\n\nYes. So the code for res is using ops(idx+1) in the Fortran code.\n\nBut in the Java code, the 'ops' array is passed to the util function. So in each recursive call, the same ops array is used. In Fortran, the 'ops' is passed as an argument. So in the subroutine, the 'ops' is an array of length 3.\n\nNow, testing the code. For example, when the input is 1 1 1 1 followed by + + +, the minimal value is 4 (since each addition would sum them all: ((1+1)+1)+1=4.\n\nWait, but the Java code's approach is to generate all possible combinations of pairs. For example, the first step combines any two of the four 1s, then the next step combines two of the three 1s and the result (which is 2), etc. But perhaps the minimal value depends on the order of operations.\n\nBut regardless, the code should generate all possibilities.\n\nNow, possible issues in the Fortran code:\n\n- The 'ops' array in the subroutine is declared as character(len=1), dimension(3). So each element is a single character. So when reading, the input for the operations must be given as three single-character strings, like '+' or '*'.\n\n- The current_arr in the subroutine is dimension(n), which is the current size. For example, when idx=0, n=4.\n\n- The recursive calls pass new_arr, which is of size new_size = n-1.\n\n- The min_val is initialized to huge(0_8), which is the maximum possible integer(8) value.\n\nAnother possible issue is the order of indices. In Java, the code uses 0-based indices, while Fortran uses 1-based. So the loops for i and j in the Fortran code start from 1 and j from i+1 to n.\n\nBut this should correctly capture all pairs (i,j) where i < j.\n\nAnother possible problem is that in the Java code, the initial list is an ArrayList of Longs. So the Fortran code uses integer(kind=8) for the numbers, which corresponds to Java's long.\n\nBut what if the numbers are larger than what 64-bit integers can hold? Probably, the problem constraints allow for 64-bit integers, as per Java's code.\n\nNow, the Fortran code uses integer(kind=8) for the numbers. So it should handle large numbers.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input from the user's example. Let's say the input is:\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n+ * +\n\nThen, the code should compute the minimal possible value.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal value is achieved via specific combinations.\n\nBut regardless, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, potential issues:\n\n- The 'ops' array in the Fortran code is read as three characters, but the Java code reads three strings. So if the input for the operations is given as, e.g., \"+ * *\", each operation is a single character. So in Fortran, the 'read' statement would need to read each as a single character. So in the input, the user must enter each operation as a single character, possibly separated by spaces.\n\nYes, that's correct. So for the three operations, the input line could be \"+ * +\".\n\nAnother thing: in the Fortran code, the subroutine 'util' is declared as recursive. This is necessary for it to call itself.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, the first index of an array is 1 by default, so the code for i and j loops in the Fortran code starts from 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the code, when creating the temp array, we have 'allocate(temp(n-2))' and then fill it with elements not i or j. For n=4, that's 2 elements. For n=3, when idx=1, temp is size 1, and new_arr is size 2.\n\nWait, when n=3 (current size is 3), the pair (i,j) loops i from 1 to 2, j from i+1 to 3. For each pair, temp is allocated as n-2 = 1. Then new_arr is size n-1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: deallocating the temp and new_arr arrays. If not deallocated, it could cause memory leaks, but in a small program like this, it's not a big problem. But in Fortran, it's good practice to deallocate after use.\n\nNow, putting all this together, the Fortran code should work similarly to the Java code.\n\nBut let's check the base case. When idx=3, the current_arr has size 1 (n=1), so current_arr(1) is the value. We compare it to min_val and update if smaller.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the translated Fortran code should be correct."
