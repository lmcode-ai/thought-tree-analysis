    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nSo the program reads an integer n from input, then reads n integers into a list. The main logic is determining the earliest time when there's a gap of more than 15 minutes between consecutive elements. The result is the first position where this gap occurs plus 15, or the last element plus 15, but not exceeding 90. Also, if the first element is over 15, the result is 15.\n\nFirst, I'll need to handle input in Fortran. Java uses a Scanner, but Fortran reads from standard input using READ statements. So, I'll start by reading n, then reading an array of n integers.\n\nIn Java, they use an ArrayList. In Fortran, I can use an allocatable array. So declare the array with INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: a(:), then allocate it once n is read.\n\nNext, the logic. The first check is if the first element is greater than 15. If so, result is 15. Otherwise, loop through the array from the second element to see if the difference between current and previous is >15. If found, set flag and break. Then, depending on flag, set result to a[pos]+15 or the last element +15. Also, cap the result at 90.\n\nLet me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, read n. Then allocate a with size n. Then read the elements.\n\nNow, handling the initial condition: if a(1) >15 (Fortran is 1-based), then result is 15. Else, loop from i=2 to n, check a(i) -a(i-1) >15. If yes, set pos to i-1, flag=1, break.\n\nWait, in Java, the list is 0-based. So in Fortran, the indices start at 1. So when Java checks a.get(i) - a.get(i-1), for i starting at 1, that's equivalent to Fortran's i starting at 2. So in the loop, i would be from 2 to n.\n\nIf such a gap is found, then pos is i-1 (Java's index) which in Fortran would be (i-1) as well, but since i in Fortran starts at 2, i-1 is 1-based here. Wait, maybe not. Let's think:\n\nIn Java, for i from 1 to n-1 (since the loop runs i from 1 to i <n), checking a[i] and a[i-1]. So for the array [a0, a1, a2, ... a(n-1)], i runs from 1 to n-1. So in Fortran, the array is a(1) to a(n), and i runs from 2 to n. Because a(i) - a(i-1) would compare each consecutive pair.\n\nSo the loop in Fortran should be from i=2 to n. Wait, the original Java loop is for (int i = 1; i < n; i++). So for i in 1 to n-1 (since Java's for loop is until i <n). Then comparing a.get(i) and a.get(i-1). So in Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so the same comparison would be between a(i) and a(i-1) for i from 2 to n. So the loop in Fortran is from i=2 to n.\n\nSo, in the Fortran code, after reading the array, check if a(1) >15. If so, set result=15. Else, loop from i=2 to n, check if a(i)-a(i-1) >15. If any such occurrence, set pos = i-1 (Fortran's index here is i-1, which would be the previous element's position). Then set flag=1 and exit loop.\n\nWait, in Java, pos is set to i-1 (the index of the previous element). In Fortran terms, when i is the current loop index (starting at 2), a(i) is the current element, a(i-1) is the previous. So the gap is between a(i) and a(i-1). If the gap is >15, then the pos is i-1 (the index of the previous element in Fortran's 1-based array). Then, the result is a(pos) +15.\n\nIf no gaps are found, then the result is a(n) +15. Then, check if result exceeds 90. If so, cap at 90.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate a(n).\n\nRead a.\n\nIf a(1) >15, result=15.\n\nElse:\n\n   Initialize flag=0, pos=0.\n\n   Loop i from 2 to n:\n\n      if (a(i) - a(i-1) >15) then\n\n          pos = i-1\n\n          flag =1\n\n          exit loop\n\n      end if\n\n   end loop\n\n   if (flag==1) then\n\n      result = a(pos) +15\n\n   else\n\n      result = a(n) +15\n\n   endif\n\nThen, if result>90, set to 90.\n\nPrint result.\n\nNow, handling edge cases. For example, if n is zero? But according to the problem, n is given as input. Wait, the Java code reads n and then reads exactly n elements. So in Fortran, assuming n is at least 1? Well, the code as written in Java starts with n, and then reads n elements. So in Fortran, the same.\n\nAnother edge case: if all elements are <=90 and the sum is beyond 90. For example, if the last element is 85, then +15 is 100, which is capped to 90.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran:\n\nVariables needed: n, a as integer array, result, pos, flag.\n\nDeclarations:\n\ninteger :: n, i, value, result, pos, flag\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen allocate a(n).\n\nRead a from input. Wait, in Fortran, can read all elements at once. So read(*,*) a(:)\n\nThen process.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, pos, flag, result\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n    \n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(a(n))\n    read(*,*) a\n    \n    if (a(1) > 15) then\n        result = 15\n    else\n        flag = 0\n        pos = 0\n        do i = 2, n\n            if (a(i) - a(i-1) > 15) then\n                pos = i-1\n                flag = 1\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (flag == 1) then\n            result = a(pos) + 15\n        else\n            result = a(n) + 15\n        end if\n    end if\n    \n    if (result > 90) then\n        result = 90\n    end if\n    \n    print *, result\n    \nend program\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after checking the first element, the else part includes the loop. But in Fortran, the code structure is similar.\n\nBut need to make sure that when n is 1. For example, if n is 1, then the loop from 2 to n won't run. So, if n=1, then the code checks a(1) >15. If yes, result 15. Else, enters else part. The loop doesn't run, so flag remains 0. So result is a(1) +15. Then check if exceeds 90.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nTesting some examples.\n\nOriginal Java code example:\n\nSuppose input is 2 1 16. Then a is [1,16]. The difference is 15, which is not >15. So result is 16+15=31, which is under 90.\n\nAnother example: input is 3 15 30 45. The differences are 15, 15. No gaps. So result is 45+15=60.\n\nAnother example: input is 5 10 25 40 55 70. The gaps are 15, 15, 15, 15. So result is 70+15=85.\n\nIf the input is 1 10: result is 25. If input is 1 16: first element is 16>15, so result 15.\n\nAnother case where a gap exists: input 4 10 20 40 60. The difference between 20 and 40 is 20>15. So pos is 2 (the index of 20), result is 20+15=35. Then check if 35>90? No. So output 35.\n\nWhat if the result after adding 15 is 100? Then it's capped to 90.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the code should handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nIn Fortran, when reading the array, if the input is given as a single line, the read(*,*) a will read all elements. But if the input is given with elements on separate lines, it should still work. But the Java code uses nextInt() which reads tokens, so same as Fortran's list-directed read.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, if the array is read with read(*,*) a, then each element is read from input. So the code should handle that.\n\nTesting the code with n=0? But in Java, the code reads n, then creates an array list. If n=0, the loop runs 0 times. But in Fortran, allocating a(0) is allowed? Probably not, but the problem probably assumes n is a positive integer as per the code's logic. The original code's input would have n as a positive integer, but in practice, need to handle n=0. However, in the Java code, if n is zero, the code would throw an error when checking a.get(0). So perhaps the problem assumes n is at least 1.\n\nSo the Fortran code as written would work under the same assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the translated code should work as intended."
