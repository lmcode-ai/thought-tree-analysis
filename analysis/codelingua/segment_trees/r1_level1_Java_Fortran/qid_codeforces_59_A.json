    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. The program reads a word from the user, counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters, then decides to convert the entire word to uppercase if there are more uppercase letters, lowercase if more lowercase, or default to lowercase if they're equal.\n\nFirst, I'll need to replicate the input reading. In Fortran, I'll use READ(*,*) to get the input string. Then, loop through each character of the string to count uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\nWait, how does Fortran handle characters? Each character in a string can be accessed by index. So for each character in the word, check if it's uppercase or lowercase. In Java, they use Character.isUpperCase, but in Fortran, I'll have to check the ASCII values. So for a character ch, if it's between 'A' and 'Z', it's uppercase. Similarly, between 'a' and 'z' for lowercase.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input string.\n2. Initialize uppercase and lowercase counters to 0.\n3. Loop over each character in the string:\n   a. Check if the character is uppercase; increment uppercase if yes.\n   b. Else, check if lowercase; increment lowercase.\n4. After the loop, compare the counts.\n5. Convert the entire string to uppercase or lowercase based on the counts, or default to lowercase if equal.\n\nIn Fortran, converting the case can be done by checking each character and adjusting its ASCII value. For example, to uppercase, for each character in the string, if it's lowercase, subtract 32 (since 'a' is 97, 'A' is 65). Similarly for lowercase, add 32 if it's uppercase.\n\nWait, but there's a better way. Maybe create functions to convert the entire string to upper or lower. Alternatively, use the ASCII manipulation.\n\nAlternatively, use Fortran's intrinsic functions. Wait, Fortran doesn't have built-in functions for case conversion, so I'll have to implement that.\n\nSo first, let's handle the input.\n\nIn Fortran, the code would start with something like:\n\nprogram codeforces_59_A\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100) :: word\n    integer :: uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0\n    integer :: i\n    read(*,*) word\n    ! Now loop through each character\n    do i = 1, len_trim(word)\n        if (word(i:i) >= 'A' .and. word(i:i) <= 'Z') then\n            uppercase = uppercase + 1\n        else if (word(i:i) >= 'a' .and. word(i:i) <= 'z') then\n            lowercase = lowercase + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n    ! Now compare counts\n    if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n        ! Convert to uppercase\n        call to_upper(word)\n    else\n        ! Convert to lowercase\n        call to_lower(word)\n    end if\n    print *, trim(word)\nend program\n\nWait, but wait: the Java code converts the entire string to upper or lower. So I need to write subroutines to do that.\n\nImplementing to_upper and to_lower:\n\nsubroutine to_upper(str)\n    character(*), intent(inout) :: str\n    integer :: i\n    do i = 1, len(str)\n        if (str(i:i) >= 'a' .and. str(i:i) <= 'z') then\n            str(i:i) = achar(iachar(str(i:i)) - 32)\n        end if\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nsubroutine to_lower(str)\n    character(*), intent(inout) :: str\n    integer :: i\n    do i = 1, len(str)\n        if (str(i:i) >= 'A' .and. str(i:i) <= 'Z') then\n            str(i:i) = achar(iachar(str(i:i)) + 32)\n        end if\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nBut in Fortran, the len(str) in the subroutine will process the entire declared length, which might include trailing spaces. But the input word is read with len=100, but trimmed with len_trim in the loop. Wait, when we read using read(*,*) word, the variable word is of length 100, but the actual input might be shorter. The len_trim(word) gives the length without trailing spaces. So in the loop, we check up to len_trim(word), but when converting, perhaps the subroutines should process all characters, including trailing spaces. Wait, no. Because the trailing spaces are part of the input? Wait, no: when reading with read(*,*) word, the input is read into the variable, which is 100 characters long. If the input is shorter than 100, the rest is filled with spaces. But the original Java code reads a single token (using next()), so the input word has no spaces. So in Fortran, the read(*,*) will read the first word, and the rest is padded with spaces. So when processing, in the loop, len_trim(word) will give the actual length of the input word (excluding trailing spaces). So the loop counts correctly. But when converting to upper or lower, the trailing spaces would be left as is, which is okay.\n\nBut when converting the entire string, the subroutines would process all 100 characters. So trailing spaces (which are part of the variable) would be converted, but spaces are not letters, so the code would not change them. So that's okay.\n\nBut perhaps in the conversion subroutines, we should process only the non-space characters. Wait, but the code in Java converts the entire string, including all characters, but in practice, the input is a single word. So the Fortran code would process the entire variable, but for the actual input part, it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe trim the word before processing. But in the Java code, the input is read as in.next(), which reads the next token (without spaces). So in Fortran, using read(*,*) word would read a single word, and the rest is spaces, but the loop counts up to len_trim(word). So the counts are correct.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead the word.\n\nCount uppercase and lowercase letters in the trimmed part.\n\nBased on counts, convert the entire trimmed word to upper or lower.\n\nWait, but in the Fortran code, the word variable is 100 characters long. So when converting, the trailing spaces are part of the string. But when printing, using trim(word) would remove trailing spaces, which matches the Java code (since Java's next() reads a token without spaces).\n\nBut perhaps in the conversion subroutines, we should process only the actual characters of the word, not the trailing spaces. So perhaps process up to len_trim(word).\n\nAlternatively, when converting the word, process all characters, but in practice, trailing spaces are left as is. But in the original code, the conversion is done on the entire word (including trailing spaces?), but in Java, the word has no trailing spaces. Hmm. So perhaps in the Fortran code, after processing, when we print, we need to trim the word to remove trailing spaces. So when we call to_upper or to_lower, we need to process the entire word, but when we print, we use trim(word) to avoid trailing spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be adjusted to process only the actual characters. Let's think: when we read the word, the actual input is stored in the variable, but padded with spaces. For example, if the input is \"Hello\", then the variable word is \"Hello\" followed by 95 spaces. So in the count loop, we process up to len_trim(word) (which is 5 in this case). The conversion subroutines would process all 100 characters, but the trailing spaces would not be modified (since they are spaces). When we print trim(word), the trailing spaces are removed. So the conversion is applied to the entire word, but the trailing spaces (which are part of the variable) are left as spaces. But since the Java code's word doesn't have those, this is okay.\n\nTherefore, the code should process all characters, but when printed, trim the word to remove trailing spaces.\n\nBut in the conversion, the trailing spaces are not letters, so the code for to_upper and to_lower would not modify them. So it's safe.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read the word into a character variable.\n\n- Loop through each character up to len_trim(word) to count uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n- Compare counts and decide to convert to upper or lower.\n\n- Apply the conversion to the entire word (including trailing spaces, but they won't change).\n\n- Print the trimmed word.\n\nSo the code should look like this:\n\nBut how to handle the subroutines. Let's include them inside the program as internal subroutines.\n\nWait, in Fortran, can we have internal subroutines using contains? Yes.\n\nSo the code would be structured as:\n\nprogram codeforces_59_A\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100) :: word\n    integer :: uppercase, lowercase, i\n\n    read(*,*) word\n    uppercase = 0\n    lowercase = 0\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(word)\n        if (word(i:i) >= 'A' .and. word(i:i) <= 'Z') then\n            uppercase = uppercase + 1\n        else if (word(i:i) >= 'a' .and. word(i:i) <= 'z') then\n            lowercase = lowercase + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n        call to_upper(word)\n    else\n        call to_lower(word)\n    end if\n\n    print *, trim(word)\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine to_upper(str)\n        character(len=*), intent(inout) :: str\n        integer :: i\n        do i = 1, len(str)\n            if (str(i:i) >= 'a' .and. str(i:i) <= 'z') then\n                str(i:i) = achar(iachar(str(i:i)) - 32)\n            end if\n        end do\n    end subroutine to_upper\n\n    subroutine to_lower(str)\n        character(len=*), intent(inout) :: str\n        integer :: i\n        do i = 1, len(str)\n            if (str(i:i) >= 'A' .and. str(i:i) <= 'Z') then\n                str(i:i) = achar(iachar(str(i:i)) + 32)\n            end if\n        end do\n    end subroutine to_lower\n\nend program codeforces_59_A\n\nWait, but in the conversion subroutines, the loop is from 1 to len(str). But str is the word variable which is length 100. So all 100 characters are processed. But the original input word's characters beyond the trimmed length are spaces. So when converting, spaces are not modified, which is correct.\n\nBut when the code converts to upper or lower, it's modifying the entire 100-character variable, including the trailing spaces, but since they are spaces, they are not changed. Then, when printing with trim(word), the trailing spaces are removed, which matches the Java code's output.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nNow, let's check edge cases. For example, if the input is all uppercase letters. The count will be uppercase = len_trim(word), lowercase =0, so convert to uppercase. The conversion subroutine will leave uppercase letters as is. Same for lowercase.\n\nIf the input is mixed case, it converts properly.\n\nWhat about the case where uppercase and lowercase counts are equal? The Java code converts to lowercase. So in the Fortran code, the 'else' clause includes that case, since if uppercase is not greater than lowercase, then we use to_lower. So if they are equal, it does to_lower, which matches the Java code.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the correct translation."
