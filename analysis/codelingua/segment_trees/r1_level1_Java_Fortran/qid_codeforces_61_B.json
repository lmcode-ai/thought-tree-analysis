    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. \n\nThe program reads three words, removes all non-alphabetic characters and converts them to lowercase. Then it generates all permutations of these three words concatenated together. Then, for each student's input, it checks if their processed input matches any of these permutations. If it does, output ACC, else WA.\n\nFirst, I'll need to handle string manipulation in Fortran. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Reading Inputs:** In Java, they read three lines, process each by removing non-letters and lowercasing. In Fortran, I'll need to read three lines as well. But Fortran's string handling is a bit different. Also, processing the strings to remove non-alphabetic characters. Hmm. How to do that?\n\nIn Java, replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z]\", \"\") removes all characters except letters. So, in Fortran, I need to loop through each character of the string and keep only the alphabetic ones. Then convert to lowercase.\n\nWait, but Fortran is case-insensitive for variable names, but the processing here is case-sensitive. Wait, the original code converts everything to lowercase. So after removing non-letters, we make them all lowercase.\n\nSo for each input word, process by:\n\n- Iterate each character, check if it is a letter (a-z, A-Z). If so, keep it, else skip.\n- Then convert the remaining characters to lowercase.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each input string, create a new string that includes only the letters, then convert to lowercase.\n\n2. **Generating permutations:** The Java code creates all 6 possible permutations of the three words. So perm1 to perm6. In Fortran, we can create an array or list containing these permutations. But the order is all possible permutations of the three words. Since there are 3! = 6 possible orders, each concatenation of the three words in those orders.\n\nWait, the code in Java uses:\n\nperm1: word1 + word2 + word3\n\nperm2: word1 + word3 + word2\n\nperm3: word2 + word1 + word3\n\nperm4: word2 + word3 + word1\n\nperm5: word3 + word2 + word1\n\nperm6: word3 + word1 + word2\n\nSo these are all 6 permutations. So in Fortran, I can generate these six combinations and store them in an array or list.\n\n3. **Processing student inputs:** For each student's input, process it similarly (remove non-letters, lowercase), then check if it matches any of the six permutations.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read three words, process each into w1, w2, w3.\n\n- Generate the six permutations as concatenated strings.\n\n- Read number of students, then for each student's input, process it and check against the permutations.\n\nNow, how to implement each part in Fortran.\n\nLet's start with reading the three words.\n\nIn Fortran, reading a line can be done with read(*,'(a)') str. But need to process the string.\n\nProcessing each word: For each character in the original string, check if it's a letter. So for each character, use ichar(c) to get ASCII value. Check if between 65-90 (A-Z) or 97-122 (a-z). Then, append to a new string, and then convert to lowercase.\n\nWait, but converting to lowercase can be done by checking if uppercase and adding 32. Or maybe using the Fortran function to lowercase. Wait, Fortran doesn't have a built-in lowercase function. So perhaps we can write a helper function to convert a character to lowercase.\n\nSo, for each character in the input string:\n\nIf it's uppercase (A-Z), convert to lowercase by adding 32.\n\nSo, for example, if the character is 'A' (ASCII 65), adding 32 gives 97 ('a').\n\nSo the processing steps for a string would be:\n\nInitialize a new string as empty.\n\nLoop through each character in the input:\n\n   c = current character\n\n   if (c is a letter):\n\n       if uppercase (65-90), convert to lowercase by adding 32.\n\n       append to new string.\n\nSo, in Fortran code, perhaps a function to process the string.\n\nNow, writing a function to do this.\n\nThen, generate the six permutations.\n\nFor example, perm1 is the concatenation of w1, w2, w3.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nStore all six permutations in an array, maybe.\n\nThen, for each student input, process the same way, then check if it's equal to any of the permutations.\n\nBut in Fortran, string comparison can be done with == if they are of the same length.\n\nBut the student's processed input must exactly match one of the permutations.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead the three initial words, process each into w1, w2, w3.\n\nCreate an array of six elements, each being a permutation.\n\nThen read N students, for each:\n\n   process their input into test_case.\n\n   check if test_case equals any of the six permutations.\n\n   output ACC or WA accordingly.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- In Fortran, strings are fixed-length, but when you process them, you need to trim whitespace. Wait, no. The original Java code reads the entire line, then processes it. So in Fortran, when we read a line, it includes all characters except the newline. So processing should be similar.\n\nBut when processing, perhaps leading or trailing spaces in the original input would be removed? Wait, in Java, the nextLine() reads the entire line, including leading and trailing spaces. So for example, if the input is \"  aBc123Def  \", then after processing, it becomes \"abcdef\".\n\nIn Fortran, when reading a line, leading and trailing spaces are part of the string. So when processing, we need to loop through each character in the input line, check if it's a letter, and append.\n\nSo the processing in Fortran would collect all the letters, regardless of their position in the input string.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nFirst, the processing function.\n\nLet's write a function that takes a string and returns the processed version.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can return character strings. So:\n\nfunction process_str(s) result(res)\n    character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n    character(len=256) :: temp ! assuming maximum length after processing is 256\n    integer :: i, j\n    character :: c\n    j = 0\n    temp = ''\n    do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n        c = s(i:i)\n        if ((c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') .or. (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z')) then\n            j = j + 1\n            if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n                temp(j:j) = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n            else\n                temp(j:j) = c\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n    res = temp(1:j)\nend function\n\nWait, but the maximum length might be an issue. Let's assume that the processed strings are not longer than, say, 1000 characters. Alternatively, use a large enough buffer. Alternatively, use allocatable strings. But older Fortran versions may not support that. But assuming Fortran 2003 or later, allocatable strings are possible.\n\nAlternatively, the code can process the input into a string with maximum possible length. Let's proceed with that.\n\nThen, the main program.\n\nIn the main program:\n\nRead three lines, process each into w1, w2, w3.\n\nThen generate the six permutations.\n\nThen read N, then N test cases, process each, check against permutations.\n\nNow, reading the three initial words:\n\nIn Fortran, reading a line can be done with:\n\ncharacter(len=256) :: input_str\n\nread(*, '(a)') input_str\n\nThen process it with process_str.\n\nSo:\n\ninput_str1 = process_str(trim(input_str))\n\nBut wait, the function process_str would process the input string, including leading and trailing non-alphabetic characters, but the 'trim' is not necessary because the processing function already checks each character. For example, if the input is '   aBc123Def  ', the function will process each character, including the leading and trailing spaces, but they are non-alphabetic, so they are skipped.\n\nWait, no. The input_str is read with '(a)', which captures all characters in the line except the newline. Then, the processing function loops through each character in the input_str, including leading and trailing spaces, but those are non-alphabetic and thus skipped. So trim is not needed. For example, the input line may have leading spaces which are part of the string, but those are checked and skipped.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncall read_line(input_str)\n\nBut in Fortran, how to read a line. The 'read(*, '(a)')' reads until the end of the line, including leading spaces.\n\nSo code:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: line, w1, w2, w3\n\nread(*, '(a)') line\n\nw1 = process_str(line)\n\nSimilarly for w2 and w3.\n\nThen permutations:\n\nperm(1) = trim(w1) // trim(w2) // trim(w3)\n\nperm(2) = trim(w1) // trim(w3) // trim(w2)\n\nperm(3) = trim(w2) // trim(w1) // trim(w3)\n\nperm(4) = trim(w2) // trim(w3) // trim(w1)\n\nperm(5) = trim(w3) // trim(w2) // trim(w1)\n\nperm(6) = trim(w3) // trim(w1) // trim(w2)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you concatenate strings, leading and trailing spaces are included. For example, if w1 is 'abc' (length 3), stored in a variable of length 1000, then trim(w1) would give 'abc' (length 3), so concatenating the trims would give the correct string.\n\nBut when we process the words, the result from process_str is a string that has all the alphabetic characters, with no leading or trailing spaces, since non-alphabetic characters are removed. So w1, w2, w3 are already the processed strings (only letters, lowercase). So when we concatenate, do we need to trim them? Well, the process_str function returns a string that is as long as the number of valid characters. For example, if the original input has leading and trailing non-letters, the processed string will have those removed, so the actual characters are the valid ones, so trimming is not needed. But perhaps the process_str returns a string with trailing spaces? Wait, no. For example, in the code for process_str, after the loop, res = temp(1:j), which is a substring from 1 to j. So the length of res is j. However, in Fortran, the function's return type's length must be fixed. Wait, no. When you declare the function as returning a character(len=*), but how is the length determined? Well, in the code I wrote earlier, the function process_str has a result(res), which is a character string. But the way I wrote it, temp is a character(256) variable, and then res is assigned temp(1:j). However, the function's return type length would be 256. Because the temp is declared as 256. So when we assign res = temp(1:j), the res variable would have length 256, but only the first j characters are non-blank. Wait, but in Fortran, when you assign a substring, the length of the result is fixed based on the declaration.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to adjust the process_str function to return a variable-length string. Alternatively, perhaps using adjustl and trim to manage leading spaces. Alternatively, use allocatable strings.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's rethink the process_str function.\n\nAlternative approach: create a function that returns a string with all the letters, converted to lowercase, in the order they appear. So for example, input \"A1b C\", the output is \"abc\".\n\nSo, in the process_str function, after collecting the characters into temp, the result is a string of exactly length j, with the collected characters.\n\nBut Fortran requires the function's result to have a fixed length. So perhaps using an allocatable character variable.\n\nSo, modifying the function to:\n\nfunction process_str(s) result(res)\n    character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: res\n    character(len=len(s)) :: temp\n    integer :: i, j\n    character :: c\n\n    j = 0\n    temp = ''\n    do i = 1, len(s)\n        c = s(i:i)\n        if ((c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') .or. (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z')) then\n            j = j + 1\n            if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n                temp(j:j) = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n            else\n                temp(j:j) = c\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n    res = trim(temp(1:j))\nend function\n\nWait, but temp is declared as len(s), which is the length of the input string. But after processing, the result is j characters. So temp(1:j) gives a substring of length j. Then trim is unnecessary, because temp(1:j) has no trailing spaces. Wait, no. Because temp was initialized to all spaces. Wait, no. temp is declared as character(len=len(s)), which for len(s) being the input's length. Then, temp is initialized as all blanks. Then, in the loop, for each valid character, j increments and temp(j:j) is set to the lowercase character. So after processing, temp(1:j) has the processed characters, and from j+1 to len(s) are blanks. Then, res is assigned temp(1:j). Wait, no. Because temp is of length len(s), temp(1:j) is a substring of length j. However, in Fortran, when you assign a substring, the length is fixed. So if j is 5, then temp(1:5) is a 5-character string. But when you assign res = temp(1:j), res becomes a 5-character string (assuming allocatable). So by using an allocatable result, the function can return a string of exactly the needed length.\n\nSo this approach would work if the compiler supports allocatable character variables in functions. Which is Fortran 2003 or later.\n\nAssuming that the Fortran compiler supports this, the process_str function can return a variable-length string containing only the processed characters.\n\nThen, in the main program, variables w1, w2, w3 can be allocatable strings.\n\nSo, code:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: w1, w2, w3, perm(6)\n\nThen, read lines, process them into w1, w2, w3.\n\nAfter that, generate the permutations.\n\nFor example:\n\nperm(1) = w1 // w2 // w3\n\nperm(2) = w1 // w3 // w2\n\nperm(3) = w2 // w1 // w3\n\nperm(4) = w2 // w3 // w1\n\nperm(5) = w3 // w2 // w1\n\nperm(6) = w3 // w1 // w2\n\nBut need to check if these permutations are correctly generated.\n\nThen, read the number of students N.\n\nThen, for each student, read their input line, process it into test_case, then check if it equals any of the permutations.\n\nBut comparing strings in Fortran: if test_case == perm(i), then it's a match.\n\nBut since all the perm(i) and test_case are processed to have no non-letter characters and are lowercase, the comparison is straightforward.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling dynamic strings with allocatable characters. Need to make sure that the Fortran code uses the correct syntax.\n\n- Reading lines with possible leading/trailing spaces. But the process_str function takes care of that.\n\nNow, let's outline the full code.\n\nFirst, the process_str function.\n\nThen, the main program.\n\nSample code:\n\nmodule processing\ncontains\n    function process_str(s) result(res)\n        implicit none\n        character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: res\n        integer :: i, j, ascii\n        character :: c\n\n        allocate(character(len=len(s)) :: res)  ! Max possible length\n        res = ''\n        j = 0\n        do i = 1, len(s)\n            c = s(i:i)\n            ascii = ichar(c)\n            if ((ascii >= 65 .and. ascii <= 90) .or. (ascii >= 97 .and. ascii <= 122)) then\n                j = j + 1\n                if (ascii >= 65 .and. ascii <= 90) then\n                    res(j:j) = char(ascii + 32)\n                else\n                    res(j:j) = c\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n        res = res(1:j)  ! Truncate to actual length\n    end function process_str\nend module processing\n\nprogram main\n    use processing\n    implicit none\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: w1, w2, w3, test_case\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: perm(6)\n    character(len=1000) :: line\n    integer :: students, i, j\n    logical :: matched\n\n    !

The code uses read(*, *) students, which leaves the input pointer at the end of the line. Then, the next read(*, '(a)') line would read the next line. But in Java's code, after reading the integer with in.nextInt(), it reads the next line (including any remaining characters on the same line) with in.nextLine().\n\nWait, Java's code does:\n\nstudents = in.nextInt();\n\nin.nextLine();\n\nThen, for each student, read a line.\n\nSo in Fortran, after reading the integer, there might be remaining characters in the line (like if the input was '3  abc', but the code reads 3 and then the next line). So, in Fortran, when reading the integer, the code should read the entire line, parse the integer, and then proceed.\n\nBut in the code above, the read(*, *) students would consume any leading whitespace and read the integer, but leave the rest of the line (including possible other inputs) in the buffer. So, the next read(*, '(a)') would read the rest of the line, which may be empty.\n\nThis could lead to errors. For example, if the input is:\n\n3\n\ntest1\n\ntest2\n\ntest3\n\nBut if after reading the integer students, the code reads the rest of the line (which may be empty) and then the next lines.\n\nBut in the Java code, after reading in.nextInt(), they call in.nextLine() to consume the rest of the line.\n\nIn Fortran, the code should do the same. So after reading the integer, read the rest of the line (which may be empty) to advance to the next line.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nAfter reading the students:\n\nread(*, *) students\n\n! consume the rest of the line\n\nread(*, '(a)') line ! this reads the remaining part of the line after the integer\n\nThen, in the loop, read each student's line.\n\nBut this can be done by reading the entire line, including possible leading spaces.\n\nAlternatively, use a dummy read to skip to the next line.\n\nBut the code may need to read the rest of the line after the integer to avoid capturing any residual input.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nread(*, *) students\n\n! read the rest of the line (possibly empty)\n\nread(*, '(a)') line\n\nThen, the loop reads students lines.\n\nBut wait, after reading the integer, the next line may be the first student's input.\n\nFor example:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\nstudent1_input\n\nstudent2_input\n\nstudent3_input\n\nIn this case, after reading the integer 3, the next read(*, '(a)') line would read the empty line (the rest of the line after 3). Then, the loop would read student1_input, student2_input, student3_input.\n\nBut if the input is:\n\n3 student1_input\n\nstudent2_input\n\nstudent3_input\n\nThen, after reading the integer 3, the rest of the line is ' student1_input', which would be processed as the first student's input. Then, the next reads would be student2_input and student3_input.\n\nBut in Java's code, after reading the integer with in.nextInt(), the code reads in.nextLine() which consumes the rest of the current line. Then, the next in.nextLine() calls read the following lines.\n\nSo to replicate that behavior in Fortran, after reading the integer, we need to read the rest of the line (possibly empty) to move the input to the next line.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nread(*, *) students\n\n! consume the rest of the line\n\nread(*, '(a)') line\n\nThen, proceed to read students lines.\n\nBut in Fortran, the first read(*, '(a)') after the integer will get the rest of the line, which may include part of the student's input if there's data after the integer.\n\nBut in the original Java code, the inputs after the three initial lines are the integer followed by the student inputs. The code expects that the integer is on its own line. If not, the original code would read it as part of the next line.\n\nBut according to the problem's input format, the three words are on separate lines, then the integer is on the next line, then the student's inputs follow.\n\nSo assuming that the integer is on a line by itself, the code after reading the integer should read the rest of that line (which is empty), then read the next lines as student inputs.\n\nBut if the integer is followed by other data on the same line, the Java code would skip that data. So the Fortran code should mimic that.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after reading the integer with read(*, *), the next read(*, '(a)') will read the rest of the current line (including any characters after the integer). That would be the first student's input, but that's not desired.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to read the entire line containing the integer, parse the integer from it, then proceed.\n\nSo, how to read a line, parse the integer from it, and then proceed.\n\nIn Fortran, this can be done as follows:\n\nread(*, '(a)') line\n\nread(line, *) students\n\nThis way, the entire line is read into 'line', and then parsed for the integer. This leaves the input pointer at the next line.\n\nThen, proceed to read the students' inputs.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\n! Read number of students\n\nread(*, '(a)') line\n\nread(line, *) students\n\nThen, for each student's input, read a line.\n\nThis way, any data after the integer in the line is ignored.\n\nSo adjusting the code:\n\n! Read number of students\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: line\n\nread(*, '(a)') line\n\nread(line, *) students\n\nThen, loop students times, reading each student's input line.\n\nThis way, the code correctly reads the integer from its own line, and then reads the next students lines.\n\nSo, integrating this into the code:\n\nprogram main\n    use processing\n    implicit none\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: w1, w2, w3, test_case\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: perm(6)\n    character(len=1000) :: line\n    integer :: students, i, j, io\n    logical :: matched\n\n    !

But since the three words are processed and concatenated, their lengths are fixed. However, in Fortran, array constructors require that all elements have the same length. So if the sum of the lengths varies between permutations, this could be a problem. Wait, no. For example, if the permutations are different orders of the same three words, their concatenation lengths are the same. Because each permutation is the three words concatenated in some order. So the total length is len(w1) + len(w2) + len(w3). So all six permutations have the same length. So the code should be okay.\n\nBut when declaring the perm array, how to set the length. Using len(w1) + len(w2) + len(w3) is possible. So:\n\nperm = [character(len= len(w1) + len(w2) + len(w3)) :: ... ]\n\nBut in Fortran, the length must be a constant expression. Wait, no. In Fortran 2003, the length can be a variable expression if using an allocatable array. But in this case, the perm array is declared as character(len=:), allocatable :: perm(6). Then, when assigning the array, each element's length is set. However, in Fortran, all elements of a character array must have the same length. So the code must ensure that all permutations have the same length. Which they do, since each permutation is the concatenation of the three words. For example, the length of each permutation is len(w1) + len(w2) + len(w3).\n\nSo when generating the permutations, each is exactly that length. So when creating the array, the length is set to that sum. So the code perm = [ ... ] with each element having the same length is correct.\n\nBut the code may need to compute the length as total_len = len(w1) + len(w2) + len(w3), then set the perm array to character(len=total_len).\n\nBut how to do this in Fortran.\n\nIn the code above, the array constructor uses:\n\nperm = [character(len=len(w1)+len(w2)+len(w3)) :: ... ]\n\nBut len(w1) is the length of the allocatable string. This should be valid.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, when using an array constructor with a type-spec, all elements must be of that type. So each element must have the specified length. But when we concatenate the three words, the resulting string's length is exactly len(w1)+len(w2)+len(w3), so each permutation element will have that length. So this should work.\n\nThus, the code should correctly generate the permutations.\n\nTesting this code:\n\nFor example, if w1 is \"a\", w2 is \"b\", w3 is \"c\", then each permutation is \"abc\", \"acb\", \"bac\", \"bca\", \"cba\", \"cab\", each of length 3.\n\nAnother example: if the three words are \"hello\", \"world\", \"test\", then each permutation is 5+5+4=14 characters. Each permutation is the concatenation of the three words in different orders.\n\nSo the code should generate the permutations correctly.\n\nNow, the final check in the loop:\n\nFor each student's test_case, compare to each perm(j).\n\nIf any match, output ACC.\n\nOtherwise, WA.\n\nIn Fortran, the comparison is case-sensitive and exact, which matches the Java code.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The process_str function must correctly process the input strings. For example, numbers and symbols are removed, letters are lowercased.\n\n- The permutations are generated correctly, in the same order as the Java code.\n\n- The student inputs are read correctly, including multiple lines after the integer.\n\n- Handling leading/trailing characters in the input lines, which should be removed by the process_str function.\n\nThus, the code should work as intended."
