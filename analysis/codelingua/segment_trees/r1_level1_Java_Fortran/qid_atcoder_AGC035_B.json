    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads a graph and checks if the number of edges is even. If not, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it performs a DFS to build a list of edges such that each node has an even degree in the resulting subgraph. The key part is the DFS function, which tracks visited nodes and the 'odd' array to determine the direction of edges.\n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have ArrayLists, so I'll have to represent the adjacency list using arrays. Maybe use a 2D array where each row represents a node's connected nodes. But since each node can have varying numbers of edges, perhaps using an array of pointers (like in Fortran's derived types) or a ragged array. Wait, Fortran can handle arrays of allocatable arrays, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, use a maximum size for each node's edges. But that's not flexible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a single array to store all edges, with an index array to track the start and end positions for each node's connections. That's a common approach. So for each node i, we can have an index array that tells where its edges start and end in the adjacency array. But building that might be a bit involved.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the connect array is an array of ArrayLists. Each element is a list of integers. In Fortran, perhaps using a derived type with an allocatable array for each node's edges. For example:\n\ntype Node\n    integer, allocatable :: edges(:)\nend type Node\n\ntype(Node), allocatable :: connect(:)\n\nBut Fortran requires that all elements of an array of derived types have the same length for their allocatable components, unless using pointers. So maybe using a pointer-based approach. Alternatively, precompute the maximum number of edges per node and use a 2D array. But that's memory inefficient. Hmm. Or, perhaps using a jagged array approach with arrays of pointers.\n\nAlternatively, use a single adjacency list array, and for each node, track the number of edges. For example:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: adjacency(:,:)\ninteger, allocatable :: degree(:)\n\nBut adjacency would be a 2D array where adjacency(i,1:degree(i)) holds the connected nodes. But in Fortran, arrays are fixed in size once allocated. So perhaps first read all edges, count the degree for each node, then allocate adjacency accordingly. Wait, but the original code builds the adjacency list incrementally. But in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be handled with allocatable arrays and reallocation, but that's a bit more work.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of edges is given (numEdge), perhaps we can pre-process the edges. Let's see: the Java code reads numEdge edges, adding each to both a and b's adjacency lists. So in Fortran, for each node, we can have a list of connected nodes, stored in an array of arrays.\n\nBut how to implement this in Fortran. Maybe using a 1D array to store all the edges, and an index array that tracks the start and end indices for each node's edges. For example:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: edges(:), start(:), end(:)\n\nBut that would require building it step by step. Let me think. For each node i, when adding a new edge, we append to the edges array, and update the start and end indices. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, use a linked list structure, but that's not straightforward in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, since in the Java code, after building the adjacency list, the main processing is a DFS. So perhaps in Fortran, for each node, we can have an array of connected nodes. For dynamic allocation, perhaps each node's adjacency list is an allocatable array that is extended as edges are added.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can have an array of allocatable arrays. Let me check. Yes, in Fortran 2003 and later, you can have arrays of allocatable components. For example:\n\ntype AdjList\n    integer, allocatable :: edges(:)\nend type\n\ntype(AdjList), allocatable :: connect(:)\n\nThen, for each node i, connect(i)%edges is an array of integers representing the connected nodes. When adding an edge, we can append to this array.\n\nSo that's possible. Then, in Fortran, for each edge (a, b), we do:\n\ncall append(connect(a+1)%edges, b)\ncall append(connect(b+1)%edges, a)\n\nBut note that in Java, the nodes are 0-based (since the input is read with a and b decremented by 1). So in Fortran, since it's easier to use 1-based indices, perhaps adjust all node indices to 1-based.\n\nSo first, when reading a and b, subtract 1 to get Java's 0-based, then add 1 again to make them 1-based in Fortran. Wait, no. Wait, the original code subtracts 1 from the input a and b to make them 0-based. Then in the code, when printing, adds 1 back. So in Fortran, perhaps just read the input as 1-based, so no need to subtract. Wait, let me check.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nWhen reading a and b, a = sc.nextInt() -1; same for b. So the input is 1-based, converted to 0-based. Then in the output, (crt +1) and (child +1) converts back to 1-based.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can keep the nodes as 1-based. So when reading a and b, subtract 1 to get the 0-based indices in Java. But in Fortran, perhaps read a and b as is (so 1-based in the input) and process them as 1-based. Wait, but the code's logic is based on 0-based nodes. So perhaps in Fortran, we can handle nodes as 1-based, adjusting the code accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, adjust to 0-based in Fortran. But Fortran is easier with 1-based arrays. Hmm. Let's see.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nnumNode = sc.nextInt(); numEdge = sc.nextInt();\n\nconnect is an array of ArrayLists, size numNode (0-based).\n\nEach edge is read as a and b, which are converted to 0-based.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps nodes are 1-based. So when reading a and b, subtract 1 to get 0-based in Java. Wait, but in Fortran code, perhaps:\n\nread a and b from input, subtract 1 (as in Java), but then in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so node numbers would start at 1, but then a and b are 0-based. So need to adjust. Wait, perhaps this is a problem.\n\nWait, the Java code uses 0-based indices for nodes. For example, connect[a] is the adjacency list for node a (0-based). So in Fortran, to avoid confusion, perhaps use 0-based arrays as well, but that's possible with Fortran's arrays. For example:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: connect(:)  ! but each element is an array of connected nodes.\n\nWait, but perhaps the easiest way is to shift everything to 1-based in Fortran. So when the input a and b are read, subtract 1 (to 0-based) as in Java code, then add 1 to make them 1-based in Fortran. Because in Java, nodes are 0-based, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. So for example, in Java, a is read as 3, becomes 2 (0-based). Then in Fortran, when reading 3, subtract 1 to 2 (Java's 0-based), then add 1 to get 3 (Fortran's 1-based). Wait, that's not right. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input a is 1-based (the user inputs 1-based nodes). Java code converts them to 0-based (a-1). So in Fortran, when reading a, we subtract 1 to get the Java 0-based, but then in Fortran, perhaps the nodes are 1-based, so need to add 1 again. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nIf the input for the Java code is, say, nodes 1 and 2, the code converts them to 0 and 1, then adds them to the adjacency list. So in Fortran, if the code is using 1-based indices, then when the input is 1 and 2, the code would treat them as 1 and 2, but that's different from Java's processing. So perhaps in Fortran, the code needs to subtract 1 from the input to get the 0-based indices as in Java, and then work with 0-based in Fortran? But Fortran's arrays can be 0-based. So perhaps in Fortran, we can define the connect array from 0 to numNode-1.\n\nYes. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: numNode, numEdge\n\nread *, numNode, numEdge\n\nThen, the connect array is allocated from 0 to numNode-1. So:\n\ntype(AdjList), allocatable :: connect(:)\n\nallocate(connect(0:numNode-1))\n\nThen, when reading a and b:\n\ndo i = 1, numEdge\n    read(*,*) a, b\n    a = a - 1\n    b = b - 1\n    call add_edge(connect, a, b)\n    call add_edge(connect, b, a)\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the indices for arrays can start at 0. So yes, that's possible.\n\nBut Fortran's array indexing is flexible. So for example:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:9) :: arr\n\ndefines an array from 0 to 9. So in the code, the connect array can be indexed from 0 to numNode-1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read numNode and numEdge.\n\n- Check if numEdge is even. If not, output -1.\n\n- Else, build adjacency lists as arrays for each node (0-based).\n\n- Then perform DFS starting from node 0 (converted to 0-based in Fortran).\n\nSo for the adjacency list:\n\nEach connect(i) (i=0 to numNode-1) is a list of connected nodes (0-based).\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to represent this. Using a derived type with an allocatable array for each node's edges.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the derived type:\n\ntype AdjacencyList\n    integer, allocatable :: edges(:)\nend type\n\nThen, the connect array is:\n\ntype(AdjacencyList), allocatable :: connect(:)\n\nallocate(connect(0:numNode-1))\n\nThen, for each a and b (0-based), append b to connect(a)%edges and a to connect(b)%edges.\n\nBut how to append elements in Fortran. For that, perhaps create a subroutine that appends an element to an array.\n\nsubroutine add_edge(list, node)\n    type(AdjacencyList), intent(inout) :: list\n    integer, intent(in) :: node\n    integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n    if (.not. allocated(list%edges)) then\n        allocate(list%edges(1))\n        list%edges(1) = node\n    else\n        call move_alloc(list%edges, temp)\n        allocate(list%edges(size(temp)+1))\n        list%edges(1:size(temp)) = temp\n        list%edges(size(temp)+1) = node\n    end if\nend subroutine\n\nBut this is inefficient as each append requires reallocation. Alternatively, preallocate in chunks. But for code simplicity, perhaps proceed with this approach, since the original Java code uses ArrayList, which dynamically resizes.\n\nOnce the adjacency list is built, the DFS is performed.\n\nIn the Java code, the variables are:\n\nstatic ArrayList<Integer> connect[];\nstatic int visited[];\nstatic boolean odd[];\nstatic StringBuilder print;\n\nIn Fortran, these would be:\n\n- connect is already handled as the adjacency list.\n\n- visited: an array (0:numNode-1) of integers.\n\n- odd: an array (0:numNode-1) of logical.\n\n- print: a string or a list of strings to accumulate the output.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are fixed-length, so using a character array or a derived type to accumulate lines. Alternatively, use a linked list of strings. But for simplicity, perhaps collect each line into an array of strings, and then print them all at the end.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps use a dynamic string buffer. But Fortran doesn't have a built-in string buffer. So maybe use a character array with a large size, but that's not flexible. Alternatively, use a temporary file to write the lines and then read back. But that's complicated. Alternatively, use an allocatable array of strings, appending each new line.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\ntype StringArray\n    character(:), allocatable :: str\nend type\n\ntype(StringArray), allocatable :: output(:)\ninteger :: output_size = 0\n\nThen, when adding a line, append to output.\n\nBut in Fortran, it's a bit cumbersome. Alternatively, use a single character variable with a large length, but that's limited by maximum length. Alternatively, use a linked list. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use a deferred-length character variable and keep appending lines with newline separators. But each time you append, you have to create a new variable. For example:\n\ncharacter(:), allocatable :: print_str\n\nprint_str = ''\n\n...\n\ncall add_line('1 2')\n\n...\n\nsubroutine add_line(line)\n    character(*), intent(in) :: line\n    character(:), allocatable :: tmp\n    tmp = print_str\n    if (allocated(print_str)) then\n        print_str = tmp // line // new_line('a')\n    else\n        print_str = line // new_line('a')\n    end if\nend subroutine\n\nBut this can be inefficient for large outputs. But perhaps manageable for the problem constraints.\n\nNow, the DFS function in Java is recursive. Fortran supports recursion, but some compilers may have stack limits, but assuming the code is within reasonable recursion depth.\n\nIn the Java code, the DFS function marks visited nodes as 1 (visiting) and then 2 (visited). The odd array tracks whether a node has an odd number of edges in the current traversal.\n\nIn Fortran, the DFS function will need to modify the visited, odd arrays, and append to the print_str.\n\nBut in Fortran, subroutines can have intent(inout) parameters. So the DFS subroutine would take crt, parent, and have access to the module variables (connect, visited, odd, print_str). Alternatively, use a module to hold these variables.\n\nYes. Because the code uses global variables in the Java code, it's easier to replicate that with module variables in Fortran.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Create a module that contains the connect, visited, odd, and the print_str.\n\nThen, the main program and the DFS subroutine can access these variables via the module.\n\nSo:\n\nmodule globals\n    type(AdjacencyList), allocatable :: connect(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: visited(:)\n    logical, allocatable :: odd(:)\n    character(:), allocatable :: print_str\nend module globals\n\nThen, in the main program and in the DFS subroutine, use these variables.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\n1. Read numNode and numEdge.\n\n2. Check if numEdge is even. If not, output -1.\n\n3. Read the edges and build the adjacency lists.\n\n4. Allocate visited and odd arrays.\n\n5. Initialize print_str.\n\n6. Perform DFS starting from node 0 (since in Java code, starts with 0).\n\n7. After DFS, output the print_str, or -1 if any condition is violated. Wait, the Java code outputs -1 only if the number of edges is odd. So in Fortran, after checking that, proceed.\n\nBut in Java code, during DFS, edges are printed in such a way that each node's degree is even. So assuming the input is valid (numEdge even and the graph allows such a configuration), the code outputs the edges.\n\nBut in Fortran, how to handle the case where it's not possible? The Java code only checks if the total edges are even. So perhaps that's the only check. So in Fortran, same logic: if numEdge is odd, output -1, else proceed.\n\nNow, let's start translating step by step.\n\nFirst, the main program structure.\n\nRead numNode, numEdge.\n\nCheck if mod(numEdge, 2) is not 0: print -1.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC035_B\n    use globals\n    implicit none\n    integer :: numNode, numEdge, a, b, i, ios\n    type(AdjacencyList), allocatable :: connect(:)\n    ! Wait, no. The connect is in the module. So in the main program, after reading, allocate the module variables.\n\n    read(*,*, iostat=ios) numNode, numEdge\n    if (ios /= 0) stop\n\n    if (mod(numEdge, 2) /= 0) then\n        print '(a)', '-1'\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    ! Allocate connect array (0-based)\n    allocate(globals%connect(0:numNode-1))\n\n    do i = 1, numEdge\n        read(*,*, iostat=ios) a, b\n        if (ios /= 0) stop\n        a = a - 1  ! convert to 0-based\n        b = b - 1\n        call add_edge(globals%connect(a), b)\n        call add_edge(globals%connect(b), a)\n    end do\n\n    ! Allocate visited and odd arrays (0-based)\n    allocate(globals%visited(0:numNode-1))\n    allocate(globals%odd(0:numNode-1))\n    globals%visited = 0\n    globals%odd = .false.\n\n    call dfs(0, -1)  ! root is 0, parent is -1 (invalid)\n\n    if (allocated(globals%print_str)) then\n        print '(a)', globals%print_str\n    else\n        print '(a)', '-1'  ? Not sure. The Java code only outputs -1 if numEdge is odd. But during DFS, if some condition is not met, maybe?\n        ! Wait, Java code doesn't handle that. So perhaps the code assumes that when numEdge is even, a solution exists. But that's not necessarily true. But according to the problem statement, perhaps the input is such that a solution exists when numEdge is even.\n\n        So perhaps in this code, if numEdge is even, the code outputs the edges. So in Fortran, after DFS, output the collected lines.\n\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine add_edge(list, node)\n        type(AdjacencyList), intent(inout) :: list\n        integer, intent(in) :: node\n        integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n        if (.not. allocated(list%edges)) then\n            allocate(list%edges(1))\n            list%edges(1) = node\n        else\n            call move_alloc(list%edges, temp)\n            allocate(list%edges(size(temp)+1))\n            list%edges(1:size(temp)) = temp\n            list%edges(size(temp)+1) = node\n        end if\n    end subroutine add_edge\n\nend program atcoder_AGC035_B\n\nWait, but the connect array is part of the globals module. So in the main program, after reading a and b, we need to add edges to the globals%connect array.\n\nWait, the code inside the main program should use the module's variables. So the main program is part of the module? Or the module is separate. So perhaps the module should be defined inside the program.\n\nAlternatively, have the module in the same file.\n\nBut in Fortran, the module needs to be defined before it's used.\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nmodule globals\n    type AdjacencyList\n        integer, allocatable :: edges(:)\n    end type\n\n    type(AdjacencyList), allocatable :: connect(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: visited(:)\n    logical, allocatable :: odd(:)\n    character(:), allocatable :: print_str\nend module\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC035_B\n    use globals\n    implicit none\n    integer :: numNode, numEdge, a, b, i, ios\n\n    read(*,*) numNode, numEdge\n\n    if (mod(numEdge, 2) /= 0) then\n        print '(a)', '-1'\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    allocate(connect(0:numNode-1))\n\n    do i = 1, numEdge\n        read(*,*) a, b\n        a = a - 1\n        b = b - 1\n        call add_edge(connect(a), b)\n        call add_edge(connect(b), a)\n    end do\n\n    allocate(visited(0:numNode-1))\n    allocate(odd(0:numNode-1))\n    visited = 0\n    odd = .false.\n\n    call dfs(0, -1)\n\n    if (allocated(print_str)) then\n        print '(a)', trim(print_str)\n    else\n        print '(a)', '-1'\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine add_edge(list, node)\n        type(AdjacencyList), intent(inout) :: list\n        integer, intent(in) :: node\n        integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n        if (.not. allocated(list%edges)) then\n            allocate(list%edges(1))\n            list%edges(1) = node\n        else\n            call move_alloc(list%edges, temp)\n            allocate(list%edges(size(temp)+1))\n            list%edges(:size(temp)) = temp\n            list%edges(size(temp)+1) = node\n        end if\n    end subroutine add_edge\n\nend program atcoder_AGC035_B\n\nWait, but the dfs subroutine is not part of the program. So the module needs to contain the dfs subroutine, or the program contains it. But since the dfs needs to access the module variables, it's better to have it inside the module.\n\nWait, the program uses the globals module. So the dfs subroutine should also be inside the module, or inside the program's contains section. However, in Fortran, the module can contain subroutines. So perhaps the best approach is to have the dfs subroutine inside the module.\n\nAlternatively, since the main program uses the module, and the module contains the variables, the dfs subroutine can be a module procedure.\n\nSo:\n\nmodule globals\n    implicit none\n\n    type AdjacencyList\n        integer, allocatable :: edges(:)\n    end type\n\n    type(AdjacencyList), allocatable :: connect(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: visited(:)\n    logical, allocatable :: odd(:)\n    character(:), allocatable :: print_str\n\ncontains\n\n    recursive subroutine dfs(crt, parent)\n        integer, intent(in) :: crt, parent\n        integer :: child, i\n        type(AdjacencyList) :: crtConnect\n\n        visited(crt) = 1\n        crtConnect = connect(crt)\n        do i = 1, size(crtConnect%edges)\n            child = crtConnect%edges(i)\n            if (child == parent .or. visited(child) == 1) then\n                cycle\n            else if (visited(child) == 2) then\n                call add_line(trim(int2str(crt+1)) // ' ' // trim(int2str(child+1)))\n                odd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)\n            else\n                call dfs(child, crt)\n                if (odd(child)) then\n                    call add_line(trim(int2str(child+1)) // ' ' // trim(int2str(crt+1)))\n                    odd(child) = .not. odd(child)\n                else\n                    call add_line(trim(int2str(crt+1)) // ' ' // trim(int2str(child+1)))\n                    odd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n        visited(crt) = 2\n    end subroutine dfs\n\n    subroutine add_line(line)\n        character(*), intent(in) :: line\n        character(:), allocatable :: tmp\n        if (allocated(print_str)) then\n            tmp = print_str\n            print_str = tmp // line // new_line('a')\n        else\n            print_str = line // new_line('a')\n        end if\n    end subroutine add_line\n\n    function int2str(i) result(s)\n        integer, intent(in) :: i\n        character(range(i)+2) :: s  ! enough space for sign and digits\n        write(s, '(I0)') i\n        s = trim(s)\n    end function int2str\n\nend module globals\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC035_B\n    use globals\n    implicit none\n    integer :: numNode, numEdge, a, b, i, ios\n\n    read(*,*) numNode, numEdge\n\n    if (mod(numEdge, 2) /= 0) then\n        print '(a)', '-1'\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    allocate(connect(0:numNode-1))\n\n    do i = 1, numEdge\n        read(*,*) a, b\n        a = a - 1\n        b = b - 1\n        call add_edge(connect(a), b)\n        call add_edge(connect(b), a)\n    end do\n\n    allocate(visited(0:numNode-1))\n    allocate(odd(0:numNode-1))\n    visited = 0\n    odd = .false.\n\n    call dfs(0, -1)\n\n    if (allocated(print_str)) then\n        print '(a)', trim(print_str)\n    else\n        print '(a)', '-1'\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine add_edge(list, node)\n        type(AdjacencyList), intent(inout) :: list\n        integer, intent(in) :: node\n        integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n        if (.not. allocated(list%edges)) then\n            allocate(list%edges(1))\n            list%edges(1) = node\n        else\n            call move_alloc(list%edges, temp)\n            allocate(list%edges(size(temp)+1))\n            list%edges(:size(temp)) = temp\n            list%edges(size(temp)+1) = node\n        end if\n    end subroutine add_edge\n\nend program atcoder_AGC035_B\n\nBut wait, the 'add_edge' subroutine is part of the program, but the 'connect' array is part of the module. So when the main program calls 'call add_edge(connect(a), b)', it's passing an element of the connect array (which is a type(AdjacencyList)) to the add_edge subroutine.\n\nYes. The add_edge subroutine is inside the main program's contains section, and it takes a list (type(AdjacencyList), intent(inout)) and a node. So when we call add_edge(connect(a), b), it appends the node to connect(a)'s edges.\n\nBut in the module's dfs subroutine, when accessing connect(crt), it gets the AdjacencyList type, which contains the edges array.\n\nSo in the dfs loop, for each child in crtConnect%edges:\n\nIn Java, the code iterates through connect[crt], which is an ArrayList. So in Fortran, the edges are stored in the edges array of the connect(crt) element.\n\nBut in Fortran, after building the adjacency lists, connect(crt)%edges is an array of integers (0-based node indices).\n\nBut in the code above, the dfs subroutine loops over i from 1 to size(crtConnect%edges). Wait, but in Fortran, the indices start at 1 for arrays. So if connect(crt)%edges is allocated, then size(edges) gives the number of elements, and the elements are accessed as edges(1), edges(2), etc.\n\nBut in the add_edge subroutine, when we append a new node, it's added to the end of the edges array. So the order of the edges is preserved as per input.\n\nBut in Java's code, the iteration is in the order edges were added. So the Fortran code's edges are in the same order.\n\nSo that should be correct.\n\nNow, the int2str function is needed to convert integers to strings for output. The function writes the integer into a string, then trims it.\n\nThe add_line subroutine appends the line to the print_str with a newline.\n\nBut in Java, the output lines are printed in the order of the edges added during the DFS. So the Fortran code should generate the same lines.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In Java, the adjacency lists are ArrayLists, which are dynamic and allow duplicates. In Fortran, the edges are stored in the order added, so duplicates are possible (if multiple edges between the same nodes). But the problem's input likely assumes simple edges, but the code doesn't check for that.\n\n- The DFS function is recursive. Fortran allows recursion, but for large graphs, this may cause stack overflow. But assuming the problem constraints are within reasonable limits.\n\n- Handling of node indices: ensuring that all are 0-based.\n\n- The parent in the initial call is -1. In the dfs subroutine, when checking child == parent, since parent is -1, and the nodes are 0-based, this should correctly skip the parent.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, during the iteration of the adjacency list, for each child, if the child is the parent or visited is 1, it skips. Else if visited is 2, it adds the edge and toggles odd[crt]. Else, it recurses.\n\nIn Fortran, the same logic applies.\n\nTesting this code would be necessary, but given the translation, this should be the correct approach."
