    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. It reads N points in D-dimensional space and counts how many pairs of points have an integer distance between them. The distance is calculated as the Euclidean distance, and then they check if the square root of the sum of squares is an integer by seeing if the square root is very close to its floor value.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read N and D from input.\n2. Read N vectors, each with D integers.\n3. For each pair of vectors (i,j) where i < j, compute the squared distance between them.\n4. Check if the square root of this distance is an integer. If yes, increment the answer.\n5. Output the total count.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's go step by step.\n\nIn Java, the 2D array is N rows and D columns. Fortran uses column-major order, but in this case, since we're accessing each element as vectors[i][d], it's probably easier to use a 2D array in Fortran with dimensions (D, N), but maybe (N, D) would be more straightforward. Let me think. The original code has vectors[i][d], so in Fortran, if it's dimensioned as vectors(N, D), then vectors(i, d) would be correct. So maybe we'll use that.\n\nReading the input: First N and D. Then N lines of D integers each.\n\nIn Fortran, reading from standard input can be done with read(*, *). So we can read N and D first.\n\nThen, allocate or declare a 2D array (if using allocatable, since the size is determined at runtime). Let's assume the code uses static allocation, but maybe in Fortran we should use allocatable arrays. Let's see.\n\nThe Java code uses:\n\nint[][] vectors = new int[N][D];\n\nIn Fortran, we can do something like:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: vectors(:,:)\nallocate(vectors(N, D))\n\nThen, reading each of the N vectors. For each i from 1 to N, read D integers into vectors(i, 1:D).\n\nWait, Fortran indices can start at 1 by default, which is convenient. So in the loops, we can loop from 1 to N.\n\nThen, the nested loops: i from 0 to N-2, j from i+1 to N-1. But in Java, arrays are zero-based. In Fortran, we'll use 1-based, so the loops would be i from 1 to N-1, j from i+1 to N.\n\nWait, original loops:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {\n    for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {\n\nSo for N points, pairs (i,j) where i < j. So in 0-based, i ranges from 0 to N-2, j from i+1 to N-1.\n\nIn 1-based indexing, i ranges from 1 to N-1, j from i+1 to N. So that's correct.\n\nNow, for each pair, compute the distance squared. Then check if sqrt(dist) is integer.\n\nIn Java, they compute dist as the sum of squares of differences for each dimension. Then, they take the square root and check if it's an integer by comparing the difference between the sqrt and its floor to a small epsilon (0.001). If the difference is less than that, it's considered integer.\n\nIn Fortran, we can do the same. So compute the sum of squares, then check if sqrt(real(dist)) is integer.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, we need to be careful with integer division and floating points. Let's see:\n\nFor example, if dist is a perfect square, like 25, then sqrt(25.0) is 5.0. So floor(sq) is 5, and the difference is zero. Otherwise, if it's not a perfect square, say 26, sqrt(26) is about 5.099, floor is 5, difference is 0.099, which is less than 0.001? No, wait. The original code uses 0.001 as the epsilon. So any sqrt that is within 0.001 of an integer would count. But the problem statement probably requires the distance to be exactly integer, but due to floating point imprecision, they use an epsilon. However, in the Java code, the variables are integers, so the sum of squares is an integer. The sqrt of an integer can be integer or irrational. So checking if the square is a perfect square.\n\nBut in code, instead of checking if sqrt is integer, perhaps a better approach is to compute the integer part and see if its square equals the distance. But the original code uses the sqrt method, which could be due to possible floating point precision. But maybe in Fortran, we can do the same.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nCompute dist as the sum of (x_i - x_j)^2 for each dimension.\n\nThen compute sq = sqrt(real(dist)), then check if sq is very close to an integer. If yes, increment answer.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndist = sum over d of (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d))**2\n\nThen, sq = sqrt(real(dist))\n\nThen check if abs(sq - floor(sq + 0.5)) < 1e-5, perhaps? Wait, the original code uses Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001. Wait, Math.floor(sq) gives the largest integer less than or equal to sq. So if sq is, say, 5.0, then floor is 5.0, difference is 0.0. If sq is 5.001, then floor is 5.0, difference is 0.001, which would not be less than 0.001. Wait, the original code checks if the absolute difference is less than 0.001. So for example, if the actual sqrt is 5.000999..., then the code counts it as 5. But maybe this is a way to handle floating point inaccuracies.\n\nBut perhaps the original code is incorrect in some edge cases, but that's how it's written. So we have to replicate that in Fortran.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nsq = sqrt(real(dist, kind=8)) ! Use double precision to match Java's Math.sqrt (which is double)\n\nThen, check if abs(sq - floor(sq)) < 0.001d0. But wait, Java's Math.floor returns a double. So, in Fortran, the floor function returns a real, but in double precision. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the FLOOR function returns an integer (as default kind?), but when used with a real argument. Wait, no. The FLOOR function returns an integer type. So perhaps, in Fortran, to get the floor of a double-precision real, we can use FLOOR(sq), which returns an integer, but then when compared to sq, there's a type conversion. Wait, maybe better to do:\n\nreal(kind=8) :: sq, floored_sq\ninteger :: floored_int\n\nsq = sqrt(real(dist, kind=8))\nfloored_int = floor(sq)\nfloored_sq = dble(floored_int)\n\nif (abs(sq - floored_sq) < 0.001d0) then\n    answer = answer + 1\nend if\n\nBut maybe in Fortran, you can do:\n\nif (abs(sq - floor(sq)) < 0.001d0) then ...\n\nBut wait, floor(sq) returns an integer, but sq is a real. So when you subtract an integer from a real, the integer is promoted to real. Wait, in Fortran, the expression would be:\n\nsq - real(floor(sq), kind=8)\n\nSo floor(sq) is an integer, but when subtracted from sq, it's converted to a real. So the code would be:\n\nif (abs(sq - real(floor(sq), kind=8)) < 0.001d0) then ...\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nfloored = floor(sq)\nif (abs(sq - floored) < 0.001d0) then ...\n\nBut wait, floor(sq) is integer. So sq - floor(sq) would be a real (since sq is real, and floor(sq) is converted to real). So perhaps:\n\nif (abs(sq - real(floor(sq), kind=8)) < 0.001d0) then ...\n\nBut let me test with some examples. Let's say sq is 5.0. Then floor(sq) is 5. sq - 5.0 is 0.0, which is less than 0.001.\n\nIf sq is 4.999, then floor(sq) is 4. sq -4 is 0.999, which is larger than 0.001, so not counted. Wait, but in the original code, it's Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001. So if the decimal part is less than 0.001, it counts. For example, 5.0009 would have 0.0009 difference, which is less than 0.001, so it's considered as 5. But actually, 5.0009's square is 25.01800081, which is not a perfect square. But the original code is written this way, perhaps to handle floating point inaccuracies. So we need to replicate that.\n\nIn Fortran, using double precision for the sqrt and the comparison.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nInitialize answer = 0\n\nLoop i from 1 to N-1\n\n   Loop j from i+1 to N\n\n       compute dist as sum over d of (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d)) ** 2\n\n       compute sq = sqrt(dble(dist)) \n\n       if (abs(sq - floor(sq)) < 0.001d0) then \n\n           answer = answer + 1\n\n       endif\n\n   end loop\n\nend loop\n\nThen print answer.\n\nNow, the data types in Fortran. The vectors are integers, as in the Java code. So in Fortran, they should be integers. So declaring vectors as integer.\n\nNow, input reading. The input is read as N, D first. Then, for each of N lines, D integers.\n\nIn Fortran, reading from standard input. Let's see. For example:\n\nRead N and D:\n\nread(*, *) N, D\n\nThen, allocate vectors(N, D):\n\ninteger, allocatable :: vectors(:,:)\nallocate(vectors(N, D))\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to N:\n\nread(*, *) (vectors(i, d), d=1, D)\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading from standard input, each read statement typically reads a line. So each line after the first line contains D integers for a vector.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    read(*, *) (vectors(i, d), d=1, D)\nend do\n\nNow, in Fortran, indices start at 1 by default, so the loops for i and j are from 1 to N-1, and j from i+1 to N.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut need to handle the case where dist is zero? Well, sqrt(0) is 0.0, which is integer. So the code counts that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Data types: Make sure that variables are declared correctly. For example, dist is the sum of squares of integers, which could be up to (1e5)^2 * D. But since D is up to 10 (from the problem statement?), but perhaps the original code uses integers, but in Fortran, dist could be a large integer. However, in Fortran, when using integer variables, the sum should be okay as long as it's within the integer range. But Fortran's default integer is usually 4 bytes. So if dist is larger than 2^31-1, this could overflow. But the original code uses Java's int, which is 32-bit. So the same problem exists. But perhaps in the problem's test cases, the distances don't exceed that. So in Fortran, use integer(kind=4) for dist.\n\nAlternatively, use a larger integer type. But the original code uses int. So in Fortran, it's the same.\n\nBut when we compute (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d)) ** 2, if the difference is large, say 1e4, the square is 1e8. If D is 10, sum could be up to 1e9, which is within 32-bit integer (up to 2e9). So perhaps it's okay.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps use 64-bit integers. But the original code uses int, which is 32-bit. So the problem's test cases probably fit in 32-bit.\n\nIn Fortran, we can declare dist as integer. So:\n\ninteger :: dist\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nSo the Fortran code would look like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, D, i, j, d, answer, dist\n    integer, allocatable :: vectors(:,:)\n    real(kind=8) :: sq\n\n    read(*, *) N, D\n    allocate(vectors(N, D))\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*, *) (vectors(i, d), d = 1, D)\n    end do\n\n    answer = 0\n\n    do i = 1, N - 1\n        do j = i + 1, N\n            dist = 0\n            do d = 1, D\n                dist = dist + (vectors(i, d) - vectors(j, d)) ** 2\n            end do\n            sq = sqrt(real(dist, kind=8))\n            if (abs(sq - floor(sq)) < 0.001d0) then\n                answer = answer + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    print *, answer\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but wait. The variables 'dist' is an integer. So when you compute (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d)) **2, which is an integer, and sum over d. Then, when you take sqrt(real(dist, kind=8)), which converts it to a double precision real.\n\nThen, floor(sq) returns the largest integer less than or equal to sq as a real? Or as an integer?\n\nWait, the Fortran floor function returns an integer. Wait no, the floor function in Fortran returns a real. Wait, wait, no: the FLOOR function returns an integer, but as a real? Or as an integer?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the FLOOR function returns an integer of default kind. For example, FLOOR(A) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to A, as an integer.\n\nSo, when you have sq as a real(8), floor(sq) returns an integer. But when you compare sq (a real(8)) to floor(sq) (an integer), the integer is converted to real(8) for the subtraction.\n\nWait, no. Because in Fortran, when you subtract an integer from a real, the integer is converted to the real kind. So for example, if sq is 5.5 (real(8)), then floor(sq) is 5 (integer). Then, sq - floor(sq) would be 5.5d0 - 5d0, which is 0.5d0.\n\nSo the code:\n\nabs(sq - floor(sq)) < 0.001d0\n\nBut wait, floor(sq) returns an integer, which when subtracted from sq (a real(8)), the integer is converted to real(8). So the expression is real(8) - real(8), which is correct.\n\nSo in code, the 'floor' function returns an integer, but when used in an expression with a real, the integer is promoted to real(8) in this case. So the code is correct.\n\nTesting this code with some examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSample input:\n\n3 2\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n\nThen, compute all pairs:\n\nPair 1-2:\n\ndistance squared: (1-3)^2 + (2-4)^2 = 4 +4=8. sqrt(8) is ~2.828. floor is 2. difference 0.828. Not less than 0.001. So no count.\n\nPair 1-3: (1-5)^2 + (2-6)^2 = 16 + 16=32. sqrt(32) ~5.656. Not integer.\n\nPair 2-3: (3-5)^2 + (4-6)^2=4 +4=8. same as first pair. So answer is 0.\n\nSo code would output 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\n2 1\n0\n2\n\nPair 1-2: (0-2)^2=4. sqrt(4)=2.0. So difference 0.0. So count +=1. Answer is 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\n2 1\n1\n3\n\ndistance squared is 4. sqrt(4)=2.0. count +=1. Answer 1.\n\nAnother test case where the sqrt is very close to an integer but not exactly. For example, dist=25, sqrt is 5.0. If dist=26, sqrt is ~5.099. So code would not count. So the code works as intended.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Variable declaration: answer should be initialized to 0.\n\n- The allocation of vectors: dimensions (N, D).\n\n- The loops for i and j are correct (1-based).\n\n- Use of real(8) for sq to match Java's double.\n\nSo the code should work."
