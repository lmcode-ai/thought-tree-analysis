But in the Java code, after processing the [l, r] range, the code sets answer[win-1] to 0 and adds it to the set. So even if win-1 wasn't in the [l, r] range (and thus wasn't removed during processing), adding it to the set would do nothing (since TreeSet doesn't allow duplicates), but answer[win-1] is set to 0. So in the Fortran code, after processing the current query's range, we need to:\n\n- Set answer(win-1) = 0.\n\n- Insert win-1 into the 'left' array (if it's not already present). But how to check if it's already present in the array.",

But the Java code's output is a string with each answer concatenated. Wait, no. Let's check the Java code: In the Java code:\n\n        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            ans.append(answer[i] + \"\");\n        }\n        System.out.println(ans);\n\nSo, the output is each answer[i] concatenated together without any spaces. So the output is a single line with each number printed consecutively. But the original Java code uses answer[i] + \"\", which converts the integer to a string, appending them together. So for example, if answer is [0,3,3,0], the output is \"0330\". So in Fortran, the code should print each element of the answer array as a string with no spaces. But the code provided earlier writes each answer element followed by a space. That's incorrect. So the correct code should print each answer element as a string, concatenated with no spaces.",

So perhaps in Fortran, we can maintain a sorted array, and for each query:\n\n- Use binary search to find the first index where element >= l.\n\n- Then, iterate through the array starting from that index, until the element exceeds r.\n\n- Collect all those elements, set their answers to win, and remove them from the array.\n\n-",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main part seems to be handling a range of integers from 0 to n-1, stored in a TreeSet called 'left'. For each query, they take a range [l, r] and a winner 'win'. Then, they iterate over all elements in 'left' that are between l and r, remove them, set their answer to 'win', but then set the winner's own position back to 0 and add it back to 'left'. \n\nWait, the Java code has a loop where for each query, they process the current l to r range. They find the ceiling of l in the TreeSet, which is the smallest element >= l. Then, while that element is <= r, they remove it from the set, set its answer to 'win'. But then, after processing all those elements, they set answer[win-1] to 0 and add win-1 back to the set. Hmm, so the winner's position is kept in the set, but others in the range are removed and their answers are set to 'win'.\n\nSo the TreeSet is being used to keep track of the remaining positions that haven't been processed yet. Each query affects a range, removing those positions (except the winner) and marking their answer as the winner.\n\nFortran doesn't have a built-in TreeSet structure, so I need to find an alternative. The TreeSet is being used to efficiently find and iterate over elements in a range. In Java, ceiling() and higher() methods are used. \n\nOne possible approach is to represent the remaining elements in a sorted list or array. But maintaining a sorted structure efficiently in Fortran could be challenging. Alternatively, maybe we can use a binary search approach on an array that's kept sorted. \n\nAlternatively, since the initial set is 0 to n-1, and elements are being removed and added back (only the winner's position is added back each time), perhaps we can track the elements using a boolean array where each index indicates whether it's present in the 'left' set. But then, how do we efficiently find the next element >= l and <= r? \n\nHmm, maybe a bitmask or an array of flags. But checking each element from l to r each time could be O(n) per query, which might be acceptable if the constraints are small. But the original Java code uses a TreeSet, which is O(log n) per operation. The problem statement mentions codeforces_356_A, which I think is a programming competition problem. So perhaps the constraints are tight, and we need an efficient solution.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, we don't have data structures like TreeSet. So perhaps the best approach is to simulate the TreeSet using an array that's kept sorted, and use binary search to find the required elements. Let's think about how to manage this.\n\nThe initial left set is all integers from 0 to n-1. So we can start with a sorted array. For each query, we need to find all elements in [l, r], set their answer to win, remove them from the array, then add back the win-1 position (if it was removed) and set its answer to 0.\n\nBut how to efficiently find and remove elements in a range [l, r] from a sorted array. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the array is sorted. We can find the first index where element >= l using binary search. Then, iterate through the elements from that index until we find elements <= r. All those elements need to be removed. For each such element, set answer[element] = win. Then remove them from the array. After that, check if win-1 is in the array. Wait, no: in the Java code, after removing the elements, they set answer[win-1] to 0 and add it back to the set. So even if win-1 was not in the range [l, r], but perhaps it's possible. Wait, in the Java code, during each query, after processing the elements in [l, r], they set answer[win-1] to 0 and add it to the set. So regardless of whether win-1 was in the range, they are adding it back. But wait, maybe the processing in the query's loop could have removed win-1. For example, if the [l, r] includes win-1, then during processing, it would have been removed from the set. Then, after that, setting answer[win-1] to 0 and adding it back. So the Java code ensures that the winner's position is always in the set after each query.\n\nSo the steps for each query are:\n\n1. Process the range l to r (inclusive):\n\n   a. Find all elements in the set that are >= l and <= r.\n\n   b. For each such element, set answer[element] = win.\n\n   c. Remove those elements from the set.\n\n2. Set answer[win-1] to 0.\n\n3. Add win-1 to the set (if it was removed in step 1c, or not).\n\nSo the key is that after each query, the winner's position is in the set, and its answer is 0. All other positions in the processed range (except the winner) are removed from the set and their answers are set to the winner.\n\nNow, how to model the set in Fortran. Let's think:\n\nThe set can be represented as a sorted array. Initially, it's [0, 1, ..., n-1]. \n\nFor each query:\n\n- Find the first index in the array where the element is >= l.\n\n- Then, iterate through elements starting from that index, as long as elements are <= r.\n\n- For each such element, mark their answer as win, remove them from the array.\n\n- Then, check if win-1 is present in the array. Wait, no: after removing those elements, the code adds win-1 back to the set. So regardless of whether it was there before, after step 1c, it's not in the set, and then step 3 adds it back. Wait, no. Let's see the Java code:\n\nAfter the loop that removes elements in [l, r], the code does:\n\nanswer[win - 1] = 0;\n\nleft.add(win - 1);\n\nSo regardless of whether win-1 was in the set before, after the loop, it's removed (if it was in [l, r]). Then, we set its answer to 0 and add it back to the set.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after processing the [l, r] range and removing those elements, we need to check if win-1 is present in the array. Wait, no. Because during the processing of the loop, if win-1 was in the range [l, r], it would have been removed. Then, in the Java code, we set its answer to 0 and add it back. So regardless of whether it was in the range, the code adds it back. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the query has l=0, r=5, and win is 3 (so win-1 is 2). The loop removes all elements in [0,5]. Then answer[2] is set to 0, and 2 is added back to the set. So even though 2 was in the range and was removed, it's added back. So in the end, the answer for 2 is 0, and it's present in the set.\n\nBut if the query's range doesn't include win-1, then during the loop, win-1 is not removed. Then, after the loop, answer[win-1] is set to 0 (but maybe it was already 0?), and the code adds it to the set again. Wait, but if it was already present in the set, then adding it again (since sets don't allow duplicates) would have no effect. So in Java's TreeSet, adding an existing element does nothing. So in the Fortran code, the array representing the set must not have duplicates and maintain sorted order.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\nFor each query:\n\n1. Find and remove all elements in [l, r] from the set. For each such element, set answer[element] = win.\n\n2. Set answer[win-1] to 0.\n\n3. Insert win-1 into the set (if it's not already present). But according to the Java code, even if it was present, the add operation would not change the set. So in Fortran, we need to check if win-1 is present. If not, add it. But in the Java code, after step 1, the element could have been removed (if it was in [l, r]), so adding it back. If it was not in [l, r], then it wasn't removed, and adding it again does nothing. So in Fortran, after step 1, we need to check if win-1 is in the array. If not, add it. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, after processing the [l, r] range, the code adds win-1 to the set, regardless of whether it was there before. But since the set in Java is a TreeSet (so no duplicates), adding an existing element has no effect. So in Fortran, after removing elements in [l, r], we need to check if win-1 is already present in the set. If not, add it.\n\nBut how to check for presence in the array? Since the array is kept sorted, we can perform a binary search for win-1. If it's not found, then insert it into the array in the correct position to maintain the sorted order.\n\nSo the main challenges are:\n\n- Implementing a sorted dynamic array that allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements, and binary search to find elements.\n\nIn Fortran, dynamic arrays can be managed using allocatable arrays, but inserting and deleting elements can be time-consuming for large arrays. However, given that the code is from a programming competition problem, and the constraints may not be too tight (but perhaps n can be up to 1e5?), this approach might not be efficient enough. But given that the original Java code uses TreeSet, which is O(log n) per operation, but if we use a sorted array with binary search, then insertion and deletion would be O(n) time, which is worse. So for large n, this approach would be too slow.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the original problem has n up to 1e5, which would make this approach with O(n) per query too slow. So the Java code uses a TreeSet, which allows O(log n) operations. So perhaps the Fortran code needs a more efficient way to represent the set.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, perhaps the problem can be approached using a binary indexed tree or segment tree. Alternatively, since the elements are consecutive integers initially, perhaps we can use a data structure that tracks the intervals of available elements. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a linked list. But Fortran doesn't have built-in linked lists, but we can simulate them using arrays. However, that could be cumbersome.\n\nWait, another idea: The Java code's TreeSet is used to track the remaining elements. Each time, when processing a query, we need to find all elements in [l, r], which can be done by starting from the first element >= l and then iterating until the element exceeds r. So perhaps in Fortran, we can maintain a sorted array, and for each query:\n\n- Use binary search to find the first index where element >= l.\n\n- Then, iterate through the array starting from that index, until the element exceeds r.\n\n- Collect all those elements, set their answers to win, and remove them from the array.\n\n- Then, check if win-1 is in the array. If not, insert it into the array (keeping it sorted).\n\nBut inserting and deleting elements in a sorted array would require O(n) time per operation. Which is okay for small n, but for large n (like 1e5), this would be too slow.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem's constraints are manageable. Let's see the code in Java. The code reads n and q, then processes q queries. The Java code uses a TreeSet, which for each query may perform multiple remove operations. Each remove in TreeSet is O(log n), so for each query, the time is O(k log n) where k is the number of elements removed in that query. But if the worst case is O(q k log n), then for large q and k, this is manageable.\n\nBut in Fortran, if we use a sorted array, then each query could require O(k + log n) time for the binary search, but for each element to remove, deleting from the array is O(n) time. So this would be O(k * n) per query, which is not acceptable for large n.\n\nSo we need a more efficient data structure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be re-expressed in a way that allows using an array-based approach with a binary indexed tree or something similar. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the set as a binary search tree structure. But implementing a balanced BST in Fortran is not trivial. However, since the elements are unique and the initial set is 0 to n-1 in order, perhaps a balanced BST isn't necessary. But inserting and deleting elements in a sorted array is O(n) time.\n\nAnother approach: Since the elements are initially 0 to n-1, and in each query, we remove elements from a certain range and then add back the winner's position. So the winner's position is added back each time. So the set is the initial elements minus all the ones that have been removed in previous queries, plus the winners added back.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nWait, maybe we can use a boolean array to track which elements are present in the set. For example, present(i) is true if i is in the set. Then, for each query, we need to iterate through all i from l to r, and for each present(i), set answer[i] to win, mark present(i) as false. Then, set present(win-1) to true and answer[win-1] to 0.\n\nBut the problem with this approach is that iterating from l to r each time could be O(n) per query, which is not feasible for large n and q. For example, if q is 1e5 and each query processes a range of 1e5 elements, this would be O(1e10) operations.\n\nBut the Java code uses a TreeSet to efficiently find the next element >= l, which allows processing only the elements in the range without iterating through all possible elements. So perhaps in Fortran, this approach isn't feasible, and we need a better way.\n\nSo, back to the original problem. To model the TreeSet in Fortran, perhaps we can use a sorted array and manage it with binary search. Even though insertion and deletion are O(n) time, perhaps for the problem's constraints, this is manageable. Let's assume that the problem's n is small enough, like up to 1e4, which would allow O(n) operations per query.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's q is small. But without knowing the problem's constraints, it's hard to say.\n\nBut given that the Java code uses a TreeSet, which is efficient for these operations, and the code is from a programming competition, perhaps the expected solution is to use a similar approach, but in Fortran, we need to find a way to mimic the TreeSet's functionality.\n\nAnother idea: Since the elements are integers, perhaps using a binary indexed tree or a segment tree to track the available elements. For example, each node in the segment tree represents a range and can quickly find the first available element >= l. But implementing such a structure in Fortran would be quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran has arrays and dynamic memory, perhaps we can use a binary search approach on the sorted array. Let's outline the steps:\n\n- Initialize a sorted array (left) with elements from 0 to n-1.\n\n- For each query:\n\n   a. Find the lower bound of l in the left array (first index where element >= l).\n\n   b. Iterate from that index onwards, while the elements are <= r.\n\n   c. Collect all those elements, set their answer to win, and remove them from the left array.\n\n   d. After processing, check if win-1 is in the left array. If not, insert it into the correct position to maintain sorted order. Also set answer(win-1) to 0.\n\nBut the problem is deleting and inserting elements from the array. Each deletion would require shifting elements, which is O(n) time. For multiple deletions in a query, this can be O(kn) per query. If k is up to n, then this is O(n\u00b2) time overall, which is not feasible for large n.\n\nHmm. So this approach would be too slow for large n.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the elements are added back only when a query sets them. So perhaps the winner's position is added back each time. So, for example, if a query sets a range [l, r], the winner's position (win-1) is added back. So, the 'left' set contains all the positions that were not processed in any query except for the winner's positions from each query.\n\nWait, but each query's processing may remove some elements and then add back the winner's element. So the 'left' set is a collection of elements that are either unprocessed or are the winners of previous queries.\n\nBut how can we manage this efficiently in Fortran?\n\nAnother idea: Since each query adds back the winner's position, perhaps we can track for each position whether it's available (present in the set). The answer for a position is the last winner that caused it to be removed, except for the winners themselves, which have answer 0.\n\nSo, perhaps we can use a binary array to track available positions, and for each query, find the first available position >= l, and iterate through all available positions in [l, r], marking them as unavailable and setting their answer. Then, we set the winner's position as available and its answer to 0.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the first available position >= l and <= r.\n\nHmm. This is similar to the problem of managing a set of available elements and quickly finding the next available element in a range. \n\nOne possible data structure for this is a segment tree that can track the available elements and allow range queries. For example, each node of the segment tree can track the minimum available element in its range. Then, to find the first element >= l, we can query the segment tree for the minimum element in the range [l, n-1]. If that element is <= r, then process it, mark it as unavailable, and repeat until the next element is > r.\n\nBut implementing a segment tree in Fortran could be challenging, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use a binary indexed tree approach. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use a binary search approach on a sorted list of available elements. But again, maintaining this list is O(n) per deletion.\n\nSo, considering all options, perhaps the only feasible way is to use a sorted array and binary search, even if it's O(n) per deletion. Let's proceed under that assumption, assuming that the problem's constraints are small enough.\n\nNow, let's think about the Fortran code structure.\n\nWe'll need:\n\n- An array 'left' that is kept sorted.\n\n- An array 'answer' initialized to 0.\n\n- For each query:\n\n   Read l, r, win (adjusting l and r to be 0-based).\n\n   Find the first index in 'left' where the element is >= l.\n\n   Then, iterate through elements starting at that index, as long as they are <= r.\n\n   For each such element:\n\n      Set answer(element) = win.\n\n      Remove the element from 'left'.\n\n   After processing all elements in [l, r], check if win-1 is in 'left'.\n\n   If not, add it to 'left' and sort 'left' again (or insert it in the correct position).\n\n   Set answer(win-1) = 0.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, even if win-1 was not in the [l, r] range, it's added back. For example, if a query has a range [1,2], and win is 5 (win-1 =4), then the code would set answer[4] to 0 and add 4 to the set, even though it's outside the range. So, even if the current query's range doesn't include the winner's position, the code is adding it to the set and setting its answer to 0.\n\nBut that's part of the problem's logic. So each query's processing adds back the winner's position to the set, regardless of whether it was in the range or not. But in the Java code, after processing the [l, r] range, the code sets answer[win-1] to 0 and adds it to the set. So even if win-1 wasn't in the [l, r] range (and thus wasn't removed during processing), adding it to the set would do nothing (since TreeSet doesn't allow duplicates), but answer[win-1] is set to 0.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after processing the current query's range, we need to:\n\n- Set answer(win-1) = 0.\n\n- Insert win-1 into the 'left' array (if it's not already present).\n\nBut how to check if it's already present in the array. Since the array is sorted, we can perform a binary search for win-1.\n\nSo the steps after processing the range are:\n\n1. Find if win-1 is in the 'left' array using binary search.\n\n2. If not present, insert it into the correct position to maintain sorted order.\n\nBut inserting into a sorted array can be done by finding the insertion point via binary search and then shifting elements to make space.\n\nNow, let's outline the code:\n\nFirst, read n and q.\n\nInitialize the 'left' array as a sorted array of 0 to n-1.\n\nInitialize answer as an array of size n, all zeros.\n\nThen, process each query:\n\nRead l, r, win. (Note: Java code subtracts 1 from l and r to make them 0-based, since the problem probably uses 1-based indices in input.)\n\nIn Fortran, we have to read l and r, subtract 1 to convert to 0-based.\n\nLoop through the 'left' array to find elements in [l, r], and process them.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently find those elements.\n\nSo:\n\nFor the current query:\n\nl = input_l - 1\n\nr = input_r - 1\n\nwin = input_win\n\nNow, in the 'left' array (sorted), find the first element >= l.\n\nThis can be done via binary search.\n\nIn Fortran, we can write a binary search function to find the lower bound (first index where element >= l).\n\nOnce we have that index, we can loop through the elements from that index onwards, as long as they are <= r.\n\nFor each such element, we need to set answer(element) = win and remove it from 'left'.\n\nBut removing elements from an array is tricky. One approach is to collect the indices of elements to remove, then create a new array excluding those elements. But for efficiency, perhaps we can track the elements to keep.\n\nAlternatively, iterate from the start index and collect all elements in the range, then remove them in one go.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be manipulated using the pack() function. For example, after collecting the elements to remove, the new 'left' array can be left = pack(left, ...).\n\nBut let's think:\n\nWe can find the starting index using binary search.\n\nThen, iterate from that index and collect all elements <= r.\n\nThe elements to remove are those elements in the range [l, r].\n\nBut the array is sorted, so once we find the first element >= l and the last element <= r, we can find the indices.\n\nSo for example:\n\nstart_idx = lower_bound(l)\n\nend_idx = upper_bound(r)\n\nThe elements from start_idx to end_idx -1 are those to remove.\n\nWait, the elements from start_idx to end_idx -1 are >= l and <= r.\n\nBut in Fortran, the array is 1-based or 0-based? Let's assume 1-based for the array indices (common in Fortran).\n\nSo, the code could look like:\n\ncall find_lower_bound(left, l, start_idx)\n\nThen, find the upper_bound for r, which is the first element > r.\n\nSo, elements from start_idx to upper_idx-1 are in [l, r].\n\nThen, those elements are to be removed. For each of those elements, set answer(element) = win.\n\nThen, the new left array is left(1:start_idx-1) // left(upper_idx:).\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut this approach would only work for sorted arrays.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n1. For the current left array, find the indices where elements are >= l and <= r.\n\n2. Split the array into elements before start_idx, elements in the range, and elements after upper_idx.\n\n3. The elements in the range are removed. Their answer is set to win.\n\n4. Then, check if win-1 is in the array. If not, add it to the array and sort.\n\nBut how to do this in Fortran.\n\nNow, implementing the binary search for lower and upper bounds.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the built-in functions if available, but in Fortran, there's no built-in binary search. So we need to implement it.\n\nLet's write a subroutine to find the lower bound (first element >= x) in a sorted array.\n\nOnce we have the start index, we can iterate from there until the elements exceed r.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nsubroutine lower_bound(arr, x, idx)\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(:), x\n    integer, intent(out) :: idx\n    integer :: low, high, mid\n\n    low = 1\n    high = size(arr)\n    idx = high + 1\n    do while (low <= high)\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if (arr(mid) >= x) then\n            idx = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else\n            low = mid + 1\n        end if\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nSimilarly, upper_bound (first element > x):\n\nsubroutine upper_bound(arr, x, idx)\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(:), x\n    integer, intent(out) :: idx\n    integer :: low, high, mid\n\n    low = 1\n    high = size(arr)\n    idx = high + 1\n    do while (low <= high)\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if (arr(mid) > x) then\n            idx = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else\n            low = mid + 1\n        end if\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nSo, for each query:\n\ncall lower_bound(left, l, start_idx)\n\ncall upper_bound(left, r, end_idx)\n\nThe elements to remove are from start_idx to end_idx -1.\n\nThese elements are in the range [l, r].\n\nSo, the elements to keep are:\n\nleft(1:start_idx-1) and left(end_idx:)\n\nSo, the new left array is:\n\nleft = [left(1:start_idx-1), left(end_idx:)]\n\nBut in Fortran, array concatenation can be done with the [ ] syntax, but for dynamic arrays, we need to manage the allocation.\n\nAlternatively, using the pack function.\n\nBut for each element in left, check if it is < l or > r.\n\nBut this would not be efficient for large arrays. So perhaps the binary search approach is better.\n\nBut in practice, for each query, we can extract the elements to remove and then update the left array.\n\nOnce the elements to remove are identified, their answer is set to win.\n\nThen, after processing all elements in the range, we need to add the win-1 to the left array if it's not present.\n\nSo, first, check if win-1 is in the current left array. Since the array is sorted, we can perform a binary search.\n\nsubroutine binary_search(arr, x, found, idx)\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(:), x\n    logical, intent(out) :: found\n    integer, intent(out) :: idx\n    integer :: low, high, mid\n\n    found = .false.\n    low = 1\n    high = size(arr)\n    do while (low <= high)\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if (arr(mid) == x) then\n            found = .true.\n            idx = mid\n            return\n        else if (arr(mid) < x) then\n            low = mid + 1\n        else\n            high = mid -1\n        end if\n    end do\n    idx = low ! insertion point\nend subroutine\n\nSo, after processing the query, we call binary_search on the new left array to see if win-1 is present.\n\nIf not found, we insert it at position idx.\n\nThen, the left array becomes:\n\nleft = [left(1:idx-1), win-1, left(idx:)]\n\nBut again, this requires reallocating and copying the array, which is O(n) time per insertion.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem's constraints, this is acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran code would need to:\n\n- Read n and q.\n\n- Initialize left array as [0, 1, ..., n-1].\n\n- Initialize answer array as all zeros.\n\n- For each query:\n\n   Read l, r, win.\n\n   Convert l and r to 0-based: l = l-1, r = r-1.\n\n   Process the current left array:\n\n      Find the elements >= l and <= r.\n\n      Remove them from left, set their answer to win.\n\n   Check if win-1 is in left:\n\n      If not, insert it into left (sorted).\n\n   Set answer(win-1) = 0.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, after removing the elements in the range, answer[win-1] is set to 0 and then added to the set. So regardless of whether win-1 was in the set before, after this step, it's added. So even if it was not removed (i.e., not in the processed range), we set its answer to 0 and add it to the set. But if it was already in the set, adding it again has no effect. But answer[win-1] is set to 0.\n\nWait, this is important. So for each query, after processing the range, the code:\n\nanswer[win-1] = 0;\n\nleft.add(win-1);\n\nSo, in the Java code, even if win-1 was not in the range, and thus not removed, the code sets its answer to 0 and adds it to the set. Which means that if it was already in the set, the add has no effect, but answer[win-1] is set to 0.\n\nSo, in the Fortran code, after processing the range, we need to:\n\nSet answer(win-1) = 0.\n\nAdd win-1 to the left array if it's not already present.\n\nBut how to ensure that win-1 is in the left array. So, after the processing step, we need to check if win-1 is present. If not, add it. But regardless, set its answer to 0.\n\nBut even if it was already present, the answer is set to 0. So in Fortran code:\n\nanswer(win) = 0\n\nBut wait, win is the input parameter, which is 1-based. So win-1 is the 0-based index.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nanswer(win-1) = 0\n\nThen, check if win-1 is in the left array. If not, add it.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each query:\n\n1. Process the range l to r:\n\n   a. Find and remove elements >= l and <= r from left.\n\n   b. Set their answers to win.\n\n2. Set answer(win-1) = 0.\n\n3. If win-1 is not present in left, add it.\n\nBut in the Java code, adding win-1 to the set (even if it was already present) has no effect. But the answer is set to 0 regardless.\n\nSo in Fortran code, after step 1, we set answer(win-1) to 0. Then, we check if win-1 is in the left array. If not, add it.\n\nSo, in the Fortran code:\n\nAfter processing the query's range and removing elements:\n\n- answer(win-1) = 0.\n\n- Check if win-1 is in the left array.\n\n   If not, insert it into left.\n\nThus, the left array will have win-1, and answer(win-1) is 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncall binary_search(left, win-1, found, idx)\n\nif (.not. found) then\n\n    ! insert win-1 into left at position idx\n\n    left = [left(1:idx-1), win-1, left(idx:)]\n\nend if\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so insertion is handled correctly.\n\nNow, handling the reading of input. The original Java code uses a FastReader class for efficient input. In Fortran, reading input can be done using standard read statements. But care must be taken to read all input correctly.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_356_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, q, i, l, r, win, j, pos\n    integer, allocatable :: left(:), answer(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n    logical :: found\n    integer :: idx_start, idx_end, idx\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    read(*,*) q\n\n    allocate(answer(n))\n    answer = 0\n\n    ! Initialize left with 0 to n-1\n    allocate(left(n))\n    do i = 1, n\n        left(i) = i-1\n    end do\n\n    do i = 1, q\n        read(*,*) l, r, win\n        l = l - 1 ! convert to 0-based\n        r = r - 1\n        win = win - 1 ! since answer(win-1) is 0-based in Fortran\n\n        ! Process elements in left between l and r\n        call lower_bound(left, l, idx_start)\n        call upper_bound(left, r, idx_end)\n\n        ! Elements to remove are from idx_start to idx_end-1\n        if (idx_start <= idx_end-1) then\n            ! Set their answers to win+1 (since in Java code, win is the input, which is 1-based)\n            ! Wait, in Java code, answer[curr] = win. Which is the input win (1-based).\n            ! Because in Java code, the input is read as win, which is the 1-based index of the winner.\n\n            ! So, in Java code, answer[curr] is set to the input win (1-based). For example, if the winner is 3, then answer[curr] = 3.\n\n            ! So in Fortran code, since answer is 0-based, we need to store win+1 in answer (since win is converted to 0-based).\n\n            ! Wait, no. In Java code, win is read as an integer, and for each element in the range, answer[curr] = win. Then, answer[win-1] is set to 0.\n\n            ! So the answer array stores 1-based winner indices. So in Fortran, the answer array should store the same values. For example, if the winner is 3 (1-based), then answer(win-1) = answer(2) is set to 0.\n\n            ! So, during processing, for each element in the range, answer(curr) = win (original 1-based value).\n\n            ! In Fortran, the 'win' variable here has been converted to 0-based (win = input_win -1). So to get the original 1-based value, we need to add 1.\n\n            ! So, answer(curr) = input_win.\n\n            ! But in the code above, after reading l, r, win:\n\n            l = l -1, r = r-1, win is input_win.\n\n            ! So, in the code, when we read win, it's the original 1-based value. So when processing the elements, answer(curr) = win.\n\n            ! But in the code above, after reading, we have:\n\n            ! win = input_win -1\n\n            ! Wait, no. Let's look:\n\n            ! In Java code, win is read as in.nextInt(). For example, the input win is 3 (1-based), and then the code sets answer[win-1] = 0 (converts to 0-based). So in Java, win is the 1-based value.\n\n            ! In Fortran code, after reading l, r, win, we need to subtract 1 from l and r to convert to 0-based. But for win, we need to keep it as the 1-based value (since answer[curr] = win in Java, which is the original input value). So in Fortran, when processing the elements in the range, we set answer(element) to the input win (1-based). But when adding back, win-1 (0-based) is used.\n\n            ! So, the confusion arises because in the Java code:\n\n            ! answer[curr] = win (win is the 1-based input).\n\n            ! answer[win -1] = 0 (win -1 is 0-based).\n\n            ! So in Fortran, during processing:\n\n            ! For each element in the range, answer(element) = input_win (the original 1-based value).\n\n            ! Then, answer(input_win -1) = 0.\n\n            ! So, during processing:\n\n            ! read l, r, input_win.\n\n            l = l -1\n\n            r = r -1\n\n            win_1based = input_win\n\n            win_0based = input_win -1\n\n            So, during processing the elements in the range:\n\n            answer(element) = win_1based\n\n            After processing:\n\n            answer(win_0based) = 0\n\n            And add win_0based to the left array if not present.\n\n            So, the code should read:\n\n            read(*,*) l_input, r_input, win_input\n\n            l = l_input -1\n\n            r = r_input -1\n\n            win_1based = win_input\n\n            win_0based = win_input -1\n\n            Then:\n\n            process elements in left between l and r:\n\n                answer(element) = win_1based\n\n            Then:\n\n            answer(win_0based) = 0\n\n            Then, add win_0based to left if not present.\n\n            So, in the code:\n\n            read(*,*) l, r, win_input\n\n            l = l -1\n\n            r = r -1\n\n            win_1based = win_input\n\n            win_0based = win_input -1\n\n            Then, during processing:\n\n            answer(element) = win_1based\n\n            After processing:\n\n            answer(win_0based) = 0\n\n            Then, check if win_0based is in left. If not, add.\n\n            So, the code should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n            So, in the code, after reading l, r, win_input:\n\n            l = l -1\n\n            r = r -1\n\n            win_1based = win_input\n\n            win_0based = win_input -1\n\n            Then process the elements:\n\n            call lower_bound(left, l, idx_start)\n\n            call upper_bound(left, r, idx_end)\n\n            The elements to process are left(idx_start : idx_end-1)\n\n            So, for j = idx_start to idx_end-1:\n\n                answer(left(j)) = win_1based\n\n            Then, remove these elements from left.\n\n            So, left becomes:\n\n            left = [left(1:idx_start-1), left(idx_end:)]\n\n            Then, set answer(win_0based) = 0\n\n            Then, check if win_0based is in left.\n\n            If not, insert it.\n\n            So, the code should be:\n\n            ! Process the range\n            call lower_bound(left, l, idx_start)\n            call upper_bound(left, r, idx_end)\n\n            if (idx_start <= idx_end -1) then\n                ! Set answer for these elements\n                do j = idx_start, idx_end -1\n                    pos = left(j)\n                    answer(pos+1) = win_input\n                end do\n\n                ! Remove elements from left\n                if (idx_start == 1) then\n                    if (idx_end > size(left)) then\n                        left = []\n                    else\n                        left = left(idx_end:)\n                    end if\n                else if (idx_end > size(left)) then\n                    left = left(1:idx_start-1)\n                else\n                    left = [left(1:idx_start-1), left(idx_end:)]\n                end if\n            end if\n\n            ! Set answer for win_0based to 0\n            answer(win_0based +1) = 0  ! because Fortran arrays are 1-based.\n\n            ! Check if win_0based is in left\n            call binary_search(left, win_0based, found, idx)\n\n            if (.not. found) then\n                ! Insert win_0based into left at position idx\n                if (size(left) == 0) then\n                    left = [win_0based]\n                else\n                    left = [left(1:idx-1), win_0based, left(idx:)]\n                end if\n            end if\n\n            ! Note: answer is 1-based in Fortran code, so pos is 0-based, so answer(pos+1) = win_input.\n\n            ! Also, win_0based is 0-based, so answer(win_0based+1) = 0.\n\n        end do\n\n        ! After processing all queries, print the answer\n        do i = 1, n\n            write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') answer(i), ' '\n        end do\n        write(*,*) ''\n\n    end program\n\nBut wait, the original Java code's answer array is 0-based, but in Fortran, the array is 1-based. So we need to adjust the indices.\n\nIn Java:\n\nanswer[curr] = win; // win is the input value (1-based)\n\nanswer[win-1] = 0; // win-1 is 0-based\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nThe answer array is 1-based. So:\n\nFor each element in the range (0-based), answer(pos+1) = win_input.\n\nFor the winner's position (0-based is win_0based), answer(win_0based +1) = 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code needs to be adjusted for 1-based indexing.\n\nNow, the remaining question is implementing the binary search, lower_bound, upper_bound, and binary_search routines.\n\nThese can be implemented as subroutines.\n\nNow, putting all this together.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be a bit tricky. For example, when left is empty, or when elements are added or removed.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Fortran, array indices start at 1. So when the array is empty, size(left) is 0.\n\nThe code for the lower_bound subroutine would need to handle empty arrays.\n\nNow, let's write the subroutines.\n\nsubroutine lower_bound(arr, x, idx)\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(:), x\n    integer, intent(out) :: idx\n    integer :: low, high, mid\n\n    low = 1\n    high = size(arr)\n    idx = high + 1\n\n    do while (low <= high)\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if (arr(mid) >= x) then\n            idx = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else\n            low = mid + 1\n        end if\n    end do\nend subroutine lower_bound\n\nsubroutine upper_bound(arr, x, idx)\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(:), x\n    integer, intent(out) :: idx\n    integer :: low, high, mid\n\n    low = 1\n    high = size(arr)\n    idx = high + 1\n\n    do while (low <= high)\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if (arr(mid) > x) then\n            idx = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else\n            low = mid + 1\n        end if\n    end do\nend subroutine upper_bound\n\nsubroutine binary_search(arr, x, found, idx)\n    integer, intent(in) :: arr(:), x\n    logical, intent(out) :: found\n    integer, intent(out) :: idx\n    integer :: low, high, mid\n\n    found = .false.\n    low = 1\n    high = size(arr)\n\n    do while (low <= high)\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if (arr(mid) == x) then\n            found = .true.\n            idx = mid\n            return\n        else if (arr(mid) < x) then\n            low = mid + 1\n        else\n            high = mid - 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    idx = low\n    found = .false.\nend subroutine binary_search\n\nNow, handling the case when the array is empty. For example, when after processing, the left array is empty. Then, inserting win_0based would create a new array with one element.\n\nAlso, when removing elements, if the indices are out of bounds, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, in the code for processing the query:\n\n            call lower_bound(left, l, idx_start)\n            call upper_bound(left, r, idx_end)\n\n            if (idx_start <= idx_end -1) then\n                ! Set answer for these elements\n                do j = idx_start, idx_end -1\n                    pos = left(j)\n                    answer(pos+1) = win_input\n                end do\n\n                ! Remove elements from left\n                if (idx_start == 1) then\n                    if (idx_end > size(left)) then\n                        left = []\n                    else\n                        left = left(idx_end:)\n                    end if\n                else if (idx_end > size(left)) then\n                    left = left(1:idx_start-1)\n                else\n                    left = [left(1:idx_start-1), left(idx_end:)]\n                end if\n            end if\n\nThis part removes the elements from left. The code uses array slicing and concatenation.\n\nBut in Fortran, array slicing is allowed, and array concatenation using the [ ... ] syntax is possible.\n\nBut when left is empty (size 0), the code may have issues. Need to handle that.\n\nNow, the final step is to print the answer array. The Java code appends each answer as a string. In Fortran, we can loop through the answer array and print each element, space-separated.\n\nBut the Java code's output is a string with each answer concatenated. Wait, no. Let's check the Java code:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\n        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            ans.append(answer[i] + \"\");\n        }\n        System.out.println(ans);\n\nSo, the output is each answer[i] concatenated together without any spaces. So the output is a single line with each number printed consecutively.\n\nBut the original Java code uses answer[i] + \"\", which converts the integer to a string, appending them together. So for example, if answer is [0,3,3,0], the output is \"0330\".\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should print each element of the answer array as a string with no spaces.\n\nBut the code provided earlier writes each answer element followed by a space. That's incorrect.\n\nSo the correct code should print each answer element as a string, concatenated with no spaces.\n\nIn Fortran, this can be done using a format that writes all elements without spaces.\n\nFor example:\n\n        do i = 1, n\n            write(*, '(I0)', advance='no') answer(i)\n        end do\n        write(*,*) ''\n\nThe 'advance='no'' prevents moving to the next line after each write. After all elements are written, a new line is printed.\n\nSo, the final code would have this part.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's test this code with a small example.\n\nFor example, the sample input:\n\n3 1\n\n1 3 2\n\nThe Java code would:\n\nn =3, q=1.\n\nleft starts as {0,1,2}.\n\nquery l=0, r=2, win=2.\n\nProcessing:\n\nelements in left >=0 and <=2 are all elements.\n\nremove them, set answer to 2.\n\nThen, set answer[1] (win-1 is 1) to 0, and add 1 back to left.\n\nSo answer array is [2, 0, 2].\n\nSo output is \"202\".\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nanswer array is 1-based. answer(1) = 2, answer(2) =0, answer(3) =2.\n\nSo the output would be \"202\".\n\nAnother test case.\n\nInput:\n\n5 2\n\n1 2 3\n\n4 5 5\n\nFirst query: l=0, r=1, win=3.\n\nProcessing elements >=0 and <=1: 0,1.\n\nSet answer[0+1=1] =3, answer[1+1=2] =3. Remove 0 and 1 from left. Left becomes [2,3,4]. Then, set answer[2] (3-1=2) to 0. Add 2 back to left. So left is [2,3,4].\n\nSecond query: l=3, r=4, win=5.\n\nProcessing elements >=3 and <=4: 3,4. Set their answers to5. Remove them from left. Left becomes [2]. Set answer[4] (5-1=4) to0. Add 4 to left. Left becomes [2,4].\n\nFinal answer array:\n\nanswer[0+1=1] =3 (from first query), answer[2] =0, answer[3+1=4] =5, answer[4+1=5] =5. Then, after second query, answer[4] =0.\n\nSo answer array is [3,3,0,5,0].\n\nSo output is \"33050\".\n\nBut let's see:\n\nAfter first query:\n\nanswer is:\n\nindex 1:3, index 2:3, others 0.\n\nThen, after processing, answer[2] is set to0.\n\nThen, second query: l=4-1=3, r=5-1=4. Wait, input is 4 5 5. So l=4-1=3, r=5-1=4.\n\nProcessing elements >=3 and <=4 in left [2,3,4]. lower_bound(3) is index 2 (element3), upper_bound(4) is index4 (since 4 is in the array, upper_bound finds first element >4, which is index4. So elements from 2 to 3-1=3-1=3 (wait, the code uses idx_end. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the code uses:\n\ncall upper_bound(left, r, idx_end)\n\nSo for the second query, r is4.\n\nThe left array after first query is [2,3,4].\n\nSo upper_bound(4) will find the first element >4. Since all elements are <=4, upper_bound returns size(left)+1=4.\n\nSo idx_end=4. The elements to process are from idx_start to idx_end-1 =2 to 3.\n\nleft(2) =3, left(3)=4.\n\nSo these elements are removed. answer[3+1=4] =5, answer[4+1=5] =5.\n\nThen, set answer[5-1=4] to0. So answer(5) is5, then set answer(4+1=5) to0?\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn the second query, win_input is5.\n\nSo win_0based is5-1=4.\n\nSo answer(4+1=5) is set to0.\n\nSo after processing the second query:\n\nanswer[3+1=4] is set to5 (from processing the element3), answer[4+1=5] is set to5 (from processing element4), but then answer[5] is set to0.\n\nSo the answer array becomes:\n\nAfter first query:\n\nanswer(1)=3, answer(2)=0, answer(3)=0, answer(4)=0, answer(5)=0.\n\nAfter second query:\n\nanswer(4)=5, answer(5)=0.\n\nSo overall:\n\nanswer = [3,0,0,5,0]\n\nSo the output is \"30050\".\n\nHmm, this seems correct.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Testing the code would be necessary.\n\nNow, this code is quite involved. The translation from Java to Fortran required handling the TreeSet with a sorted array and binary search, which increases the code's complexity. But given the constraints, this is the best approach possible.\n\nSo, the final Fortran code should look like this."
