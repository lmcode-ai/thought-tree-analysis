    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nThe Java code reads an integer N, then reads N integers into an array. It uses a priority queue (which is a min-heap) to track the minimum value encountered so far. For each element in the array, it adds the element to the queue. If the current element is less than or equal to the top of the queue (which is the minimum so far), it increments a sum. The final sum is returned, which counts how many times each element is the minimum up to that point.\n\nSo the key points here are:\n\n1. Simulate the priority queue behavior in Fortran.\n2. For each element, check if it's the smallest up to that index.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the priority queue is being used. When adding each element, the queue always contains all elements up to the current one. Then, the peek() gives the minimum. But the condition checks if the current element is <= the current minimum. Wait, but since the current element is added to the queue, the queue's minimum would be either the previous minimum or the current element. So if the current element is less than or equal to the previous minimum, then the sum increments. That means, the current element is the new minimum, so the sum increases. So the sum is counting the number of elements that are the minimum in their prefix of the array.\n\nFor example, if the array is [3, 1, 2, 4], then:\n\ni=0: add 3. Queue has [3]. Peek is 3. 3 <=3 \u2192 sum=1.\ni=1: add 1. Queue has [1,3]. Peek is 1. 1 <=1 \u2192 sum=2.\ni=2: add 2. Queue has [1,3,2]. Peek is 1. 2 >1 \u2192 no increment. Sum remains 2.\ni=3: add 4. Queue has [1,3,2,4]. Peek is 1. 4>1 \u2192 no increment. Sum is 2.\n\nSo the sum is 2, which counts the first two elements (3 and 1) as being the minimum in their respective prefixes.\n\nSo the approach is to count the number of times an element is the minimum up to its position.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently in Fortran, since Fortran doesn't have a built-in priority queue. Well, since each time we process an element, we just need to know the current minimum. So for each element, we can track the minimum up to that point. If the current element is less than or equal to the previous minimum, then it's a new minimum, so we increment the count. So the sum is the number of times a new minimum is found as we iterate through the array.\n\nWait, that's a simplification! Because in the Java code, after adding the current element to the priority queue, the peek() gives the minimum of all elements up to that point. So the condition arr[i] <= q.peek() is equivalent to checking if the current element is the new minimum. Because when you add the current element to the priority queue, the new minimum is min(previous_min, current_element). So if current_element is <= previous_min, then the new min is current_element. Otherwise, the min remains previous_min.\n\nSo the condition arr[i] <= q.peek() after adding it to the queue is equivalent to checking if the current element is the new minimum. So in other words, the sum is counting how many times an element is the minimum in the subarray up to its index.\n\nTherefore, instead of using a priority queue, we can track the current minimum as we iterate through the array. For each element, if it's less than or equal to the current minimum, we increment the sum and update the current minimum.\n\nThis would be a more efficient approach and easier to implement in Fortran. So the original Java code is unnecessarily using a priority queue when a simple variable tracking the current minimum suffices.\n\nSo the Java code can be simplified. For each element in the array, check if it is the smallest so far. If yes, increment the count. So the code can be rewritten in Java without the priority queue, which is O(n) time instead of O(n log n) time. Then the Fortran code can be written using that approach.\n\nBut the problem is to translate the given Java code, not to optimize it. Wait, but perhaps the original code's logic is equivalent to tracking the current minimum. Let's think again.\n\nIn the Java code, when adding the current element to the priority queue, the queue holds all elements up to and including the current index. Then, the peek gives the minimum. So the check is whether the current element is less than or equal to the current minimum. Because after adding the current element to the queue, the minimum is either the previous minimum or the current element. So the condition arr[i] <= q.peek() is equivalent to arr[i] being the new minimum (since after adding it to the queue, the new minimum is min(current_element, previous_min). So if arr[i] is <= previous_min, then the new minimum is arr[i], so the condition is true. Otherwise, the previous_min is still the minimum, so the current element is larger than the minimum, and the condition is false.\n\nSo the sum counts the number of times the current element is the new minimum in the array up to that point. So the code is equivalent to keeping track of the current minimum and checking if the current element is <= current minimum. So in that case, the Java code can be optimized by just tracking the current minimum, which is O(1) per element. The original code uses a priority queue, which adds O(n log n) time, but the alternative approach is O(n) time.\n\nSo for the Fortran translation, we can implement the more efficient approach. Therefore, we can avoid using a priority queue and instead track the current minimum.\n\nLet me check the sample input. Suppose the input is:\n\n4\n3 1 2 4\n\nThe Java code's sum is 2. Let's see with the alternative approach.\n\nInitialize current_min to something large. sum=0.\n\ni=0: arr[i] =3. current_min is infinity, so 3 < infinity \u2192 sum becomes 1. current_min =3.\n\ni=1: arr[i] =1. 1 <=3 \u2192 sum=2. current_min=1.\n\ni=2: arr[i]=2. 2>1 \u2192 no sum. sum remains 2.\n\ni=3: 4>1 \u2192 no sum.\n\nSo same result. So the alternative approach works. Therefore, the Java code is equivalent to tracking the current minimum. So the Fortran code can be written this way.\n\nThus, the translation can be done by replacing the priority queue logic with a current minimum variable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N.\n\n2. Read N integers into an array.\n\n3. Initialize current_min to a large value (like the maximum possible integer).\n\n4. Initialize sum to 0.\n\n5. Loop over each element in the array:\n\n   a. If the element is <= current_min, then increment sum and set current_min to this element.\n\nSo the code can be written this way.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would look like:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nRead the array.\n\nInitialize current_min to a high value (maybe using huge(0) in Fortran?), but for the first element, the initial current_min could be set to a very high value. Wait, for the first element, current_min is set to arr(1), so the first element is always counted. Let's see:\n\nIn the first iteration, current_min is set to a very high value. The first element is compared to it. If arr(1) is <= current_min (which it is, since current_min is huge), sum increments, and current_min becomes arr(1). That's correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\nsum = 0\n\ncurrent_min = huge(0)  ! Assuming integers are 32-bit or similar.\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    read *, num   ! or read the array first\n    if (num <= current_min) then\n        sum = sum + 1\n        current_min = num\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut wait, in the original Java code, the elements are read into an array first. So perhaps the Fortran code should read the array first, then process each element in order.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, sum, current_min\n    integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\n    read *, N\n    allocate(arr(N))\n    read *, (arr(i), i=1, N)\n\n    sum = 0\n    current_min = huge(0)  ! or a very large number\n\n    do i = 1, N\n        if (arr(i) <= current_min) then\n            sum = sum + 1\n            current_min = arr(i)\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, sum\n\n    deallocate(arr)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Java, the initial current_min is not set. Let's see:\n\nIn the Java code, the first element is added to the priority queue, then the check is done. So for the first element, the queue has [arr[0]], and arr[0] <= q.peek() \u2192 which is arr[0], so sum increments. So sum starts at 1. Then, for each element, it's added to the queue, then the check is done.\n\nBut in the alternative approach, the first element is compared to current_min, which is huge. So sum increments. So same result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code as written will correctly compute the same sum as the original Java code.\n\nThus, the answer is to implement this approach in Fortran, which is more efficient and straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the correct Fortran code should read N, read the array, then iterate through the array, tracking the current minimum and incrementing the count when a new minimum is found.\n\nSo the translated code is as above."
