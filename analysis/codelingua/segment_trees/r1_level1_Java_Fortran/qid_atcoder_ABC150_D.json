    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does first. The program reads n and m, then an array a of n elements. Each element is divided by 2 immediately. Then it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in a. If the LCM exceeds m, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it checks if dividing the LCM by each a[i] results in an even number. If any do, output 0. Otherwise, compute (m // lcd + 1) // 2 and output that.\n\nHmm. Let me break down the steps for Fortran.\n\nFirst, variable declarations. Java uses int and long. Fortran uses integer(kind=...) but for simplicity, maybe integer. But since the LCM could be large, maybe use 64-bit integers. So perhaps integer(8) for variables like gcd, lcd, and the loop counters.\n\nIn Fortran, reading inputs: read from standard input. The Java code uses Scanner to read n and m. Then reads n integers into a array, each divided by 2. So in Fortran, read n and m, then read n values into an array a, each element divided by 2.\n\nWait, in Java, the division is integer division. So in Fortran, when we divide by 2, it should be integer division as well. So a(i) = num / 2, but ensure it's integer division. So perhaps using integer variables.\n\nNext, the LCM calculation. The Java code uses a loop, computing GCD each time and then LCM as (current_lcd * a[i]) / gcd. The getGCD function is recursive in Java. In Fortran, functions can be recursive if specified. So create a recursive function for GCD.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, recursion needs to be declared. So the function should be declared as recursive. Let's see. So, the getGCD function would be a recursive function.\n\nIn Fortran, the main program can't have functions inside; I'll need to use modules or internal functions. Alternatively, put the GCD function in a module. But for simplicity, maybe write it as an external function. Or perhaps write it as a recursive function inside the main program.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the main program can't have internal functions unless using contains. So perhaps structure the code with a contains section for the GCD function.\n\nSo, the structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: n, m, i, gcd_val, lcd, res\n    integer(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n    read *, n, m\n    allocate(a(n))\n    do i = 1, n\n        read *, a(i)\n        a(i) = a(i) / 2_8\n    end do\n    lcd = 1_8\n    do i = 1, n\n        gcd_val = get_gcd(lcd, a(i))\n        lcd = (lcd * a(i)) / gcd_val\n        if (lcd > m) then\n            print *, 0\n            stop\n        end if\n    end do\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (mod(lcd / a(i), 2_8) == 0) then\n            print *, 0\n            stop\n        end if\n    end do\n    res = (m / lcd + 1) / 2\n    print *, res\ncontains\n    recursive function get_gcd(a, b) result(gcd)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n        integer(8) :: gcd\n        if (b == 0) then\n            gcd = a\n        else\n            gcd = get_gcd(b, mod(a, b))\n        end if\n    end function get_gcd\nend program\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables are case-insensitive. So get_gcd is okay.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the getGCD function is called with two arguments. The function here is recursive, which is allowed.\n\nAnother thing: when reading the array elements, each is read as an integer and divided by 2. So in Fortran, if the input is even, division by 2 is okay. But if odd, integer division would truncate, same as Java.\n\nNow, the LCM calculation: in the loop, for each a[i], compute GCD of current lcd and a[i], then compute the new lcd as (lcd * a[i]) / GCD. If at any point lcd exceeds m, print 0 and stop.\n\nThen, check each a[i] to see if (lcd / a[i]) is even. If any are even, output 0. Otherwise, compute (m // lcd +1) //2.\n\nWait, in Java, the code does (m / lcd +1) / 2. Since integer division truncates towards zero. In Fortran, integer division is similar. So (m / lcd) +1 divided by 2.\n\nSo (m / lcd + 1) //2. So in Fortran, that's ( (m / lcd) +1 ) / 2. But since all variables are integers, the division is integer.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Using integer(8) for variables. In Fortran, the kind for 8-byte integers is usually selected via selected_int_kind, but for simplicity, using integer(8) is common, though compiler-dependent.\n\n- The get_gcd function is recursive. Does Fortran handle recursion correctly? Yes, if the function is declared as recursive.\n\nWait, in the code above, I have \"contains\" and the function get_gcd. The function needs to be declared as recursive. So the correct declaration is:\n\nrecursive function get_gcd(a, b) result(gcd)\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n    integer(8) :: gcd\n    ...\nend function\n\nYes. So that's handled.\n\nTesting possible edge cases. For example, if n is 0, but the code probably expects n >=1. But according to the problem statement, perhaps n is positive.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the array is 0-based, in Fortran it's 1-based. So in the loops, the Java code loops from 0 to n-1, Fortran loops from 1 to n.\n\nBut when translating, the code in the loops for the array a is correct.\n\nWait, the Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    a[i] = ...;\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the loop is do i = 1, n.\n\nBut the array a in Java is size n. So in Fortran, a is allocated as a(n), and the loop runs from 1 to n. Each element is read correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother point: the LCM starts at 1. For each a[i], compute GCD with current LCM, then update LCM. That's same in both codes.\n\nThe check after computing the LCM: if any (lcd / a[i]) is even, output 0. Because in Java, the code does (lcd / a[i]) %2 ==0. So in Fortran, mod(lcd / a(i), 2) ==0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be structured as:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead n integers, divide each by 2, store in a.\n\nCompute LCM.\n\nIf LCM > m: output 0.\n\nCheck all a[i] for (lcd / a[i]) even.\n\nIf any: output 0.\n\nElse compute (m / lcd +1) // 2.\n\nNow, implement this in Fortran.\n\nPotential issues in Fortran code:\n\n- When reading the input, how to read the array? For example, in Fortran, if the input is given as space-separated numbers, then reading with read *, a(i) in a loop would work.\n\nBut in practice, the user might input the numbers in a single line or multiple lines. But the code should handle either case, as Fortran's read will proceed to the next line automatically.\n\nBut perhaps the original Java code reads each a[i] one by one via sc.next(), which splits on any whitespace. So the Fortran code's approach of reading a(i) in a loop is correct.\n\nAnother point: the initial value of lcd is 1. Then for each a[i], compute GCD(lcd, a[i]). So in the first iteration, GCD(1, a[0]) is 1, so LCM becomes 1 * a[0] /1 = a[0]. Then next elements.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, possible test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: the GCD function's parameters. In Java, the parameters are long, so 64-bit. In Fortran, using integer(8) for a and b.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: n, m, i, gcd_val, lcd, res\n    integer(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n    read *, n, m\n    allocate(a(n))\n    do i = 1, n\n        read *, a(i)\n        a(i) = a(i) / 2_8\n    end do\n    lcd = 1_8\n    do i = 1, n\n        gcd_val = get_gcd(lcd, a(i))\n        lcd = (lcd * a(i)) / gcd_val\n        if (lcd > m) then\n            print *, 0\n            stop\n        end if\n    end do\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (mod(lcd / a(i), 2_8) == 0) then\n            print *, 0\n            stop\n        end if\n    end do\n    res = (m / lcd + 1) / 2\n    print *, res\ncontains\n    recursive function get_gcd(a, b) result(gcd)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n        integer(8) :: gcd\n        if (b == 0) then\n            gcd = a\n        else\n            gcd = get_gcd(b, mod(a, b))\n        end if\n    end function get_gcd\nend program\n\nWait, the function is called get_gcd, and in the contains section. So the code should be okay.\n\nWait, in the contains section, the function is inside the program, so it has access to variables in the program. But in this case, the function is standalone.\n\nYes, the function get_gcd is recursive and uses its own parameters.\n\nAnother thing: in the division by 2_8, the _8 is the kind parameter for 8-byte integers, ensuring that the 2 is treated as an 8-byte integer. That's correct.\n\nTesting possible inputs. For example, if the input is:\n\n2 50\n4 6\n\nThen the Java code reads a as [4/2=2, 6/2=3]. LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. Then check 6/2=3 (mod 2 is 1), 6/3=2 (mod 2 is 0). So the second check fails, output 0. So the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nAnother test case where LCM is okay and all (lcd / a[i]) are odd.\n\nLike input:\n\n2 36\n2 6\n\nThen a becomes [1, 3]. LCM is 3. Check 3/1=3 (mod 2 is 1), 3/3=1 (mod 2 is 1). Then (36 /3 +1)/2 = (12+1)/2=13/2=6. So output 6.\n\nSo the Fortran code should do that.\n\nThus, the code seems correct."
