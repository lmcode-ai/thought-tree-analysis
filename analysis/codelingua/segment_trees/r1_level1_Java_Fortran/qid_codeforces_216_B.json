So for an edge between A and B, when processing A, neighbor B is not parent (assuming parent is someone else), so count increments by 1.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, looking at the main method: It reads integers m and n. Then it creates a graph as a linked list of linked lists, which represents adjacency lists for a graph. The graph has m+1 nodes (since the loop is from 0 to m). Then, it reads n edges and adds them to the graph, both directions because it's undirected. \n\nThe 'seen' array keeps track of visited nodes. Then, for each unvisited node, it performs a DFS. The DFS checks for cycles and counts the number of edges in the component. If a cycle is detected and the edge count is odd, it increments 'toremove'. Finally, it adjusts 'toremove' based on the parity of (m - toremove) and outputs the result.\n\nFortran doesn't have built-in linked lists, so I'll need to represent the graph using arrays. Maybe an array of arrays, but since Fortran's allocatable arrays can be jagged, but it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, use an adjacency list with a list for each node. But how?\n\nWait, maybe using a 2D array where each row represents a node's adjacent nodes, and the first element of each row is the count. Like, for each node i, adj(i, 1) is the number of neighbors, followed by the neighbor indices. But the maximum number of neighbors per node is needed. Let's see, the original code uses LinkedList, so each node can have any number of neighbors. So in Fortran, perhaps using a dynamic structure. Alternatively, use a list of arrays with varying sizes, but that's complicated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use a single array where each node's adjacency list is stored contiguously, with an index array that tracks where each node's list starts and ends. For example, for each node i, adj_start(i) and adj_end(i) give the indices in a large adjacency array. That's a common approach. But for simplicity, perhaps since m can be up to whatever, but in the Java code, the nodes are numbered from 1 to m. Let's see.\n\nWait, the original code uses m and n as inputs. The graph has m nodes (since the loop is up to m, but starting from 0, but nodes are 1-based in the rest of the code). Wait, the graph is initialized from 0 to m, which would be m+1 nodes. But the main loop for processing nodes is from 1 to m. So node 0 is not used? Let me check the original code.\n\nYes, in the main method, the code adds m+1 linked lists (from i=0 to m). Then, when adding edges, it uses nodes x and y, which are read from input. Since the problem probably uses 1-based node numbering, node 0 is probably not used. So in Fortran, perhaps the adjacency list can be represented with 1-based indices, ignoring 0. So nodes are 1 to m.\n\nSo for the adjacency list in Fortran, I'll need each node to have a list of connected nodes. Since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays per node, perhaps using a 2D array where each row is a list of neighbors, with a separate array tracking the count for each node.\n\nAlternatively, use an array of derived types, each containing a dynamic array. But that's possible in modern Fortran. Let me think. For example:\n\ntype Node\n    integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\n    integer :: count = 0\nend type Node\n\ntype(Node), allocatable :: adj(:)\n\nBut then, whenever adding a neighbor, we have to dynamically resize the array. That's possible but may be a bit involved. Alternatively, pre-allocate a maximum size, but that might not be efficient. Since in the Java code, edges are added in both directions, each edge is added twice.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read m and n.\n\n2. Initialize an adjacency list structure. For each node, store a list of connected nodes.\n\n3. Read n pairs of x and y, and add each to the adjacency lists of x and y.\n\n4. Perform a DFS to detect cycles, count edges in the component, and check if the count is odd.\n\nBut how to represent the adjacency list in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, use a linked list in Fortran, but that's complicated. Another approach: For each node, store the neighbors in a dynamic array. For example, adj is an array of allocatable integer arrays. In Fortran 2003 and later, this is possible.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: adj(:,:)  ! Hmm, not directly. Maybe an array of arrays.\n\nBut in Fortran, you can have an array of pointers to arrays. But perhaps it's easier to use a derived type with an allocatable array. Let's proceed.\n\nType definition:\n\ntype AdjList\n    integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\nend type\n\ntype(AdjList), allocatable :: graph(:)\n\nThen, allocate graph from 0 to m (as in Java code). But in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default, but you can set them. So:\n\nallocate(graph(0:m))\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to m, allocate graph(i)%neighbors as an empty array.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you allocate, you can start with size 0 and then extend as needed. However, dynamically resizing arrays in Fortran is a bit more manual. For example, to add an element to the neighbors list, you can create a new array with size increased by 1 and copy the elements over.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible number of edges per node is m-1 (if it's a complete graph), but that's not efficient. But perhaps, given that in the Java code, edges are added one by one, in Fortran, for each x and y, we can append to the neighbors array of x and y.\n\nBut appending to an array in Fortran requires reallocation. So for each addition:\n\ntemp = [graph(x)%neighbors, y]\ncall move_alloc(temp, graph(x)%neighbors)\n\nSimilarly for graph(y)%neighbors.\n\nThis way, the adjacency list can be built.\n\nOnce the adjacency list is built, the next step is the DFS.\n\nThe Java code uses a recursive DFS. However, Fortran's recursion support can be limited, depending on the compiler. But for the sake of this problem, let's assume recursion is allowed. Alternatively, implement it iteratively. But given the original code uses recursion, perhaps it's better to try to replicate that.\n\nIn Fortran, recursive functions need to be declared with the 'recursive' keyword.\n\nThe Java code's 'dfs' function returns either cycle or path. In the code, cycle is 1 and path is 0. So we can use integers for these constants.\n\nThe 'seen' array is a boolean array of size m+1 (since nodes are from 1 to m). In Fortran, we can have a logical array.\n\nThe 'count' variable in the Java code is a member variable. Since Fortran doesn't have classes, we'll need to manage this variable via parameters or module variables. Alternatively, use a module to hold the variables. But since the code may have multiple instances (though in the Java code, it's a single instance), but in Fortran, the code is likely to be procedural.\n\nSo, in the Fortran code, we'll need to manage the 'count' variable. However, since the 'dfs' function is recursive, and needs to modify 'count', which is part of the state during the traversal of each component. So perhaps, in the main program, for each component, before calling dfs, we set count to zero, and during dfs, we increment it. But since Fortran functions can't modify variables in the outer scope unless they are passed as arguments or in a module.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the 'count' is an instance variable. Each call to dfs for a component starts with count=0. But in Fortran, since functions can't directly modify variables in the main program, perhaps we need to pass 'count' as an inout argument.\n\nSo, the 'dfs' function in Fortran would need to take 'count' as an argument, and increment it during traversal.\n\nAlternatively, use a module to hold 'count' and 'seen' and 'graph'. That might make the code cleaner.\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nFirst, create a module to hold the graph, seen array, and count variable.\n\nBut since in Fortran, modules are global, but in this case, the code is single-threaded and the problem is simple, this approach should work.\n\nSo, the module would look like:\n\nmodule globals\n    integer, parameter :: path = 0, cycle = 1\n    integer, allocatable :: seen(:)\n    type(AdjList), allocatable :: graph(:)\n    integer :: count\ncontains\n    recursive function dfs(child, par) result(res)\n        integer, intent(in) :: child, par\n        integer :: res\n        integer :: i, neighbor\n        if (seen(child)) then\n            res = cycle\n            return\n        end if\n        seen(child) = .true.\n        do i = 1, size(graph(child)%neighbors)\n            neighbor = graph(child)%neighbors(i)\n            if (neighbor /= par) then\n                count = count + 1\n                res = dfs(neighbor, child)\n                if (res == cycle) return\n            end if\n        end do\n        res = path\n    end function dfs\nend module globals\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the DFS returns cycle if a cycle is detected. The logic is that if during the traversal, a node is revisited (other than the parent), it's a cycle.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the 'dfs' function would check if the child is already seen. If so, return cycle. Otherwise, mark as seen, and iterate over all neighbors except the parent.\n\nEach time a neighbor is processed (excluding the parent), increment count and recursively call dfs. If any recursive call returns cycle, propagate that.\n\nBut in the Java code, the count is incremented each time a neighbor (other than parent) is processed. Because the edge is traversed. Wait, the 'count' variable is incremented once per edge. Since each edge is visited twice (once from each node), but in the Java code, the count is incremented once per edge. Wait, let's think. When we process node X, and look at neighbor Y (which is not the parent), the code increments count. Then, when processing Y, and neighbor X (which is the parent), the code does not increment. So for each edge, it's counted once. Because each edge is processed once in each direction. So the 'count' variable is effectively counting the number of edges in the component, but since each edge is processed once in each direction, the total count would be 2 * E. Wait, but in the Java code, during the DFS, for each node child, it iterates through all its neighbors, and for each neighbor i not equal to parent, count is incremented. So for an edge between A and B, when processing A, neighbor B is not parent (assuming parent is someone else), so count increments by 1. Then, when processing B, neighbor A is parent (since parent is A), so not counted. So each edge is counted exactly once. So the total count is the number of edges in the component. So in the Java code, the count variable is equal to the number of edges in the component.\n\nSo for each component, if it's a cycle, then check if the number of edges is odd. If so, toremove is incremented.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, during the DFS, each edge is processed once, so the count variable correctly counts the edges.\n\nBut in the Java code, the count is initialized to 0 for each component. So for each unvisited node i (the start of a component), count is set to 0. Then, during the DFS, the edges are counted. So in Fortran, we'll need to reset the count to 0 each time a new component is processed.\n\nNow, in the module approach, the 'count' variable is shared. So for each component, before starting the DFS, set count = 0. Then, during the DFS, it's modified. Then, after the DFS, check if the return value is cycle, and if count is odd, increment toremove.\n\nSo the main program would:\n\n- Read m and n.\n\n- Initialize the graph (adjacency list) with 0 to m nodes.\n\nWait, but the original code in Java initializes the graph from 0 to m. But the nodes in the problem are from 1 to m, perhaps. Because the edges are read as x and y, which are likely 1-based. Then, the main loop processes i from 1 to m.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps the adjacency list is 1-based. So nodes are 1 to m. But in the Java code, the graph is initialized for 0 to m. However, the edges are added to x and y, which can be from 1 to m. So the node 0 in the Java code's adjacency list is unused. So in Fortran, maybe we can ignore node 0 and have the adjacency list from 1 to m. Let's see.\n\nBut the original code's graph is initialized with 0 to m, which is m+1 nodes. Then, the edges are added to x and y, which are possibly in 1 to m. So in Fortran, perhaps the adjacency list should be 0-based? But Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, which can complicate things. Alternatively, adjust the code to use 1-based indexing.\n\nSo in the Fortran code:\n\n- Allocate the graph from 1 to m (so m nodes). Then, when reading edges x and y, add them to graph(x) and graph(y). So the nodes are 1-based.\n\nBut then, the Java code's graph has 0 to m, but the edges are between 1-based nodes. So in Fortran, the code would have nodes 1 to m, and the graph is allocated from 1 to m. So the 0 node is omitted. Then, during processing, the code loops from 1 to m, which is correct.\n\nSo, proceeding with 1-based nodes in Fortran.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\n1. Read m and n.\n\n2. Allocate the graph as an array of AdjList from 1 to m.\n\n3. For each node from 1 to m, initialize their adjacency list as empty arrays.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you allocate a derived type array, each component is unallocated. So after allocating graph(1:m), each graph(i)%neighbors is unallocated. So for each i from 1 to m, we need to allocate graph(i)%neighbors as an empty array (size 0). So:\n\ndo i = 1, m\n    allocate(graph(i)%neighbors(0))\nend do\n\nBut wait, that would create a zero-sized array. Then, when adding elements, we can reallocate.\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't have a zero-sized array in some cases. Alternatively, initialize each as an empty array. So for each edge x and y, when adding, the code appends y to x's neighbors and x to y's neighbors.\n\nSo, for each pair x, y:\n\ncall add_edge(x, y)\ncall add_edge(y, x)\n\nwhere add_edge is a subroutine that appends the value to the adjacency list of the node.\n\nThe add_edge subroutine would handle reallocating the neighbors array.\n\nNow, for the add_edge subroutine:\n\nsubroutine add_edge(node, neighbor)\n    integer, intent(in) :: node, neighbor\n    integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n    integer :: n\n\n    n = size(graph(node)%neighbors)\n    allocate(temp(n + 1))\n    if (n > 0) then\n        temp(1:n) = graph(node)%neighbors\n    end if\n    temp(n + 1) = neighbor\n    call move_alloc(temp, graph(node)%neighbors)\nend subroutine add_edge\n\nThis way, each time a neighbor is added, the array is extended by one.\n\nOnce the adjacency list is built, the next step is the main loop.\n\nThe 'seen' array is of size m+1 in Java, but since the nodes are 1-based in Fortran, the 'seen' array can be of size m.\n\nIn the module, the seen array is allocated as:\n\nallocate(seen(m))\n\nThen, initialized to .false. before processing each component.\n\nIn the main program:\n\nuse globals\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: m, n, x, y, i, toremove, res\ntype(AdjList), allocatable :: graph(:)\nlogical, allocatable :: seen(:)\ninteger :: count\n\n! Read m and n\nread(*,*) m, n\n\n! Initialize graph\nallocate(graph(1:m))\ndo i = 1, m\n    allocate(graph(i)%neighbors(0))\nend do\n\n! Read edges\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) x, y\n    call add_edge(x, y)\n    call add_edge(y, x)\nend do\n\n! Initialize seen array\nallocate(seen(m))\nseen = .false.\n\ntoremove = 0\n\ndo i = 1, m\n    if (.not. seen(i)) then\n        count = 0\n        res = dfs(i, 0)\n        if (res == cycle) then\n            if (mod(count, 2) == 1) then\n                toremove = toremove + 1\n            end if\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nif (mod(m - toremove, 2) == 1) then\n    toremove = toremove + 1\nend if\n\nprint *, toremove\n\nBut wait, the 'dfs' function is part of the module. So the module needs to contain the graph, seen, and count variables.\n\nAlternatively, the module 'globals' contains the graph, seen, count, path, cycle.\n\nBut then, the main program must use the module.\n\nLet me reorganize.\n\nCreate a module called 'graph_module' that contains:\n\nmodule graph_module\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: path = 0, cycle = 1\n    type AdjList\n        integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\n    end type AdjList\n    type(AdjList), allocatable :: graph(:)\n    logical, allocatable :: seen(:)\n    integer :: count\ncontains\n    recursive integer function dfs(child, par) result(res)\n        integer, intent(in) :: child, par\n        integer :: i, neighbor\n        if (seen(child)) then\n            res = cycle\n            return\n        end if\n        seen(child) = .true.\n        do i = 1, size(graph(child)%neighbors)\n            neighbor = graph(child)%neighbors(i)\n            if (neighbor /= par) then\n                count = count + 1\n                res = dfs(neighbor, child)\n                if (res == cycle) return\n            end if\n        end do\n        res = path\n    end function dfs\n\n    subroutine add_edge(node, neighbor)\n        integer, intent(in) :: node, neighbor\n        integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n        integer :: n\n\n        n = size(graph(node)%neighbors)\n        allocate(temp(n + 1))\n        if (n > 0) then\n            temp(1:n) = graph(node)%neighbors\n        end if\n        temp(n + 1) = neighbor\n        call move_alloc(temp, graph(node)%neighbors)\n    end subroutine add_edge\nend module graph_module\n\nThen, the main program uses this module.\n\nprogram main\n    use graph_module\n    implicit none\n    integer :: m, n, x, y, i, toremove, res\n\n    read(*,*) m, n\n\n    ! Initialize graph\n    allocate(graph(1:m))\n    do i = 1, m\n        allocate(graph(i)%neighbors(0))\n    end do\n\n    ! Read edges\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) x, y\n        call add_edge(x, y)\n        call add_edge(y, x)\n    end do\n\n    ! Initialize seen array\n    allocate(seen(m))\n    seen = .false.\n\n    toremove = 0\n\n    do i = 1, m\n        if (.not. seen(i)) then\n            count = 0\n            res = dfs(i, 0)  ! parent is 0, but since nodes are 1-based, parent can be 0 (root)\n            if (res == cycle) then\n                if (mod(count, 2) == 1) then\n                    toremove = toremove + 1\n                end if\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (mod(m - toremove, 2) == 1) then\n        toremove = toremove + 1\n    end if\n\n    print *, toremove\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but the parent in the initial call is 0. But the nodes are 1-based. So when i is processed, and parent is 0 (which is not a node), so the first call is to i, with parent 0. Which is okay, because 0 is not a neighbor of any node (assuming the input edges don't include 0). So the code should work.\n\nBut in Fortran, the parent is passed as an integer. So when a node's neighbor is 0, but that's not part of the graph. So during the first call, the code checks if the child (i) has been seen. Initially, seen is all .false., so it marks seen(i) as true. Then, for each neighbor of i, if neighbor is not par (0), then increment count and call dfs.\n\nBut in the code, the graph is built with nodes 1 to m. So neighbor can't be 0, except if the input x or y is 0, but according to the problem statement, perhaps the input is 1-based.\n\nAssuming that the input edges are between 1-based nodes, the code is okay.\n\nAnother potential issue: in the Fortran code, when a node has no neighbors, the loop over the neighbors is skipped, and the function returns path. So the component is a single node (count 0 edges). Since count is even (0 is even), it's not added to toremove.\n\nBut in the original Java code, the component is a single node, and since the count is 0, which is even, the code doesn't add to toremove. So that's correct.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, the 'count' is initialized to 0 before each call to dfs. Then, during the dfs, each edge is processed once. So the count after dfs is the number of edges in the component.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, the count variable is part of the module, so each time before calling dfs, we set count = 0.\n\nBut in the module, the count is a module variable, which is global. So yes, in the loop, for each component, count is reset to 0.\n\nNow, testing for cycles: The DFS returns cycle if during the traversal, a node is revisited. For example, if there's a cycle in the component. But if the component is a tree (no cycles), then the DFS returns path.\n\nBut the code counts the number of edges in each cyclic component. If that number is odd, increment toremove.\n\nSo the code's logic is to count the number of cyclic components with an odd number of edges.\n\nBut the original problem is to find the minimum number of students to remove so that the remaining can be divided into pairs. The code's approach seems to be based on detecting cycles and their edge counts.\n\nBut regardless, the Fortran code should replicate the Java code's logic.\n\nAnother thing to check: In the Java code, the parameter passed to dfs is par. In Fortran, the parent is passed as an integer.\n\nNow, possible issues in Fortran:\n\n- The graph is allocated from 1 to m. So for each node in 1..m, the adjacency list is correctly built.\n\n- The 'seen' array is size m, indexed from 1 to m. So when accessing seen(child), child must be between 1 and m.\n\nIn the code, 'child' comes from the graph's neighbors, which are 1-based. So this is correct.\n\nNow, in the module's add_edge subroutine, the 'node' is the node to which the neighbor is added. So when x is read, add_edge(x, y) adds y to x's neighbors. Similarly for add_edge(y, x).\n\nBut the code uses 'call add_edge(x, y); call add_edge(y, x);' which adds both directions. So the adjacency list is built correctly.\n\nPotential problem: In Fortran, when passing parameters to subroutines, the variables must be of correct type. The 'x' and 'y' are read as integers, which is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: The 'dfs' function is recursive. Some Fortran compilers may have issues with deep recursion, but for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, compiling this code. Let me check for syntax errors.\n\nIn the module:\n\ntype AdjList\n    integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)\nend type AdjList\n\nYes.\n\nThe 'dfs' function is declared as recursive, with result(res).\n\nIn the module's 'dfs' function:\n\nif (seen(child)) then -> should be seen(child)\n\nWait, the code in the module's dfs function:\n\nif (seen(child)) then\n    res = cycle\n    return\nend if\n\nBut 'seen' is a logical array of size m, and 'child' is an integer between 1 and m.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the loop:\n\ndo i = 1, size(graph(child)%neighbors)\n    neighbor = graph(child)%neighbors(i)\n    if (neighbor /= par) then\n        count = count + 1\n        res = dfs(neighbor, child)\n        if (res == cycle) return\n    end if\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the main program uses the module's 'graph', 'seen', 'count', 'dfs', and 'add_edge'.\n\nIn the main program:\n\nAfter reading m and n, allocate(graph(1:m)) which is an array of AdjList from 1 to m.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to m, allocate(graph(i)%neighbors(0)), which initializes their neighbors as zero-length arrays.\n\nThen, for each edge, read x and y, add y to x's neighbors and x to y's neighbors.\n\nThen, allocate seen(m), initialized to .false.\n\nThen, loop over i from 1 to m.\n\nFor each unvisited i, call dfs(i, 0), which starts the dfs with parent 0.\n\nIf the return value is cycle, then check if count is odd. If yes, increment toremove.\n\nAfter processing all components, check if (m - toremove) is odd. If so, increment toremove by 1.\n\nFinally, print toremove.\n\nThis should replicate the Java code.\n\nNow, potential corner cases.\n\nTest case where m=3, n=3, edges forming a triangle (cycle of 3 nodes). The count of edges in the component is 3 (each edge is counted once). So the cycle's count is 3, which is odd. So toremove increments by 1. Then, m - toremove is 3-1=2, which is even. So total toremove is 1.\n\nAnother case: m=2, n=1. The component is a single edge (two nodes). The DFS will not find a cycle (since it's a tree), so toremove remains 0. Then, m - toremove is 2, which is even. So total toremove is 0. But if the original code's logic is to pair all students, but if even, then no removal. But if m is even, but after removing toremove, if the remaining is even, no further action. But if m - toremove is odd, increment toremove by 1.\n\nSo the code's final step is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work correctly."
