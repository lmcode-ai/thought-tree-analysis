    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does first. So, the code reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. It uses a HashMap to count the frequency of each number. Then it finds the maximum frequency. After that, it processes the array again, building another HashMap to track counts, and prints the first number whose count reaches the maximum frequency.\n\nHmm, Fortran doesn't have HashMaps, so I need to find an alternative approach. Let's think. Since the numbers are integers, maybe we can track their counts using an array. But wait, the problem is we don't know the range of the numbers. The original code uses a HashMap which allows any integer value, but in Fortran, using an array for counts might not be feasible if the values are large.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can process the array in two passes. First, find the maximum frequency. Then, in the second pass, keep track of counts and check when any number's count reaches the maximum, then output that number and exit.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, during the second pass, it's using a second HashMap (mm) to count occurrences again, and the first time a number's count reaches max, it prints it. So the idea is to find the first element in the array that reaches the maximum frequency when counted sequentially.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the array.\n2. Compute the frequency of each element and find the maximum frequency.\n3. Iterate through the array again, keeping a count for each element, and when any element's count reaches the maximum frequency, output it and stop.\n\nBut how to track counts without a HashMap in Fortran? One approach is to use an array where the index represents the element. But if the elements can be large, this might not work. However, looking at the problem statement (since it's codeforces 637A), perhaps the constraints allow for a certain maximum value, but since the original code uses a HashMap, we can't assume that.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to track counts as we iterate through the array the second time, and we need to check when a count reaches max, maybe we can use a dynamic data structure. But Fortran's limitations here are tricky.\n\nWait, maybe in the first pass, we can collect all the elements and their frequencies. Then, in the second pass, for each element, check if its frequency (from the first pass) is equal to the max. Then, track how many times we've seen it so far in the second pass. When the count in the second pass reaches the max frequency, output it. Because the first occurrence where the element's frequency is equal to the max, and we've seen it enough times.\n\nWait, no. The original code's approach is: during the first pass, count the frequencies and find the max. Then, in the second pass, build the count again from the start, and the first element whose count reaches the max during this second pass is the answer. So the second pass is like a simulation: as we iterate through the array, we increment the count for each element, and the first element to reach the max count is the one to output.\n\nSo in Fortran, to track the counts during the second pass, we can use an array where the index is the element's value, but if the elements can be very large, this would not be feasible. Alternatively, we can use a list to track which elements have been encountered and their counts. But Fortran's arrays are static, so maybe a better way is to use a dynamically allocated associative array, but Fortran doesn't have that. So perhaps a workaround is needed.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to process elements in order, and track the counts, perhaps we can use a list of pairs (element value and current count). For each element in the array, when we process it in the second pass, we check if it's already in the list and increment its count. Otherwise, add it with count 1. Then, after each increment, check if the count equals the max. If yes, output and exit.\n\nBut implementing this in Fortran would require some kind of linked list or dynamic structure. Hmm. Alternatively, since the maximum possible number of unique elements is n (if all elements are distinct), we can create two arrays: one for the elements and one for their counts, and track them as we go.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n- In the first pass, count the frequencies and find the maximum frequency.\n\n- In the second pass, for each element in the array, maintain a list of elements we've encountered so far and their counts. For each element in the array, check if it's already in the list. If yes, increment the count. If not, add it with count 1. Then check if this count equals the max. If yes, output and exit.\n\nThis requires a way to efficiently look up elements in the list. Since in the worst case, for each element in the array, we have to search through the list, which could be O(n^2), but for the purposes of programming competition problems, this might be acceptable if n is not too large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use an array to track the counts, assuming that the possible values are up to some maximum. But given that the original code uses a HashMap, we can't make such assumptions. However, perhaps the problem constraints limit the input values. For example, in the problem codeforces_637_A, perhaps the input values are within a certain range. But since the user hasn't provided the problem statement, we have to proceed without that knowledge.\n\nBut in the Java code, the elements are stored in an integer array, so perhaps the values can be up to Integer.MAX_VALUE, but in practice, for Fortran, we need a way to handle them.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a dynamic structure. But Fortran 95 (which is commonly used in programming contests) doesn't have built-in hash tables, so the alternative is to use a list of pairs (element, count) and search through them each time.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFirst, read the array and compute the frequency map. Since Fortran doesn't have HashMaps, we can use a list of elements and their counts. For each element in the array, check if it's in the list. If yes, increment the count. If not, add it with count 1. Then, after processing all elements, find the maximum count.\n\nThen, in the second pass, again process the array and track the counts using another list. For each element in the array, check if it's in the second list. If yes, increment the count. If not, add it with count 1. After each increment, check if the count equals the maximum found earlier. When found, output the element and exit.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFor the first pass:\n\n- Initialize an array (or a list) to hold elements and their counts.\n\n- For each element in the input array:\n\n   - Check if the element exists in the list.\n\n   - If it does, increment the count.\n\n   - If not, add it to the list with a count of 1.\n\nBut how to check if the element exists in the list? For each new element, loop through the list and see if it's present. This is O(n^2) time, but acceptable for small n.\n\nSimilarly, in the second pass.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nFirst, read n, then read the array.\n\nThen, process the first pass to build the frequency map and find max count.\n\nThen, process the second pass, building the count again, and check when any element's count reaches max.\n\nIn Fortran, we can use arrays of structures to hold the elements and counts.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nFor the first pass:\n\nWe can have two arrays, elements and counts. For each element in the input array, loop through elements array to see if it exists. If found, increment counts. If not, add to elements and counts arrays.\n\nOnce all elements are processed, find the maximum value in the counts array.\n\nThen, in the second pass:\n\nAgain, have two arrays (current_elements and current_counts). For each element in the input array, loop through current_elements to find if it's present. If yes, increment current_counts. Then check if current_counts equals max. If so, output and exit.\n\nIf not found, add to current_elements with count 1, check if count is max (1 == max?), which would only be possible if max is 1. Then output.\n\nThis approach would work, but could be slow for large n. However, the problem's constraints may allow it.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nLet's outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n, then the array.\n\nRead n:\n\ninteger :: n\n\nread *, n\n\nThen, read the array:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: ara(:)\n\nallocate(ara(n))\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    read(*,*) ara(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen, first pass to count frequencies.\n\nWe can use two arrays, elements and freqs. Let's start with a size of 0, and dynamically add elements.\n\ninteger, allocatable :: elements(:), freqs(:)\n\ninteger :: num_elements = 0\n\nallocate(elements(n), freqs(n))  ! worst case all elements are unique\n\nelements = 0\n\nfreqs = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    v = ara(i)\n\n    found = .false.\n\n    do j = 1, num_elements\n\n        if (elements(j) == v) then\n\n            freqs(j) = freqs(j) + 1\n\n            found = .true.\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (.not. found) then\n\n        num_elements = num_elements + 1\n\n        elements(num_elements) = v\n\n        freqs(num_elements) = 1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, find max frequency:\n\nmax_freq = 0\n\ndo i = 1, num_elements\n\n    if (freqs(i) > max_freq) then\n\n        max_freq = freqs(i)\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, second pass:\n\nWe need to process the array again, and track counts, looking for the first element whose count reaches max_freq.\n\nSimilarly, we can use two arrays, current_elements and current_counts, again allocated to size n.\n\ninteger, allocatable :: current_elements(:), current_counts(:)\n\ninteger :: current_num = 0\n\nallocate(current_elements(n), current_counts(n))\n\ncurrent_elements = 0\n\ncurrent_counts = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    v = ara(i)\n\n    found = .false.\n\n    do j = 1, current_num\n\n        if (current_elements(j) == v) then\n\n            current_counts(j) = current_counts(j) + 1\n\n            if (current_counts(j) == max_freq) then\n\n                print *, v\n\n                stop  ! exit program immediately\n\n            end if\n\n            found = .true.\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (.not. found) then\n\n        current_num = current_num + 1\n\n        current_elements(current_num) = v\n\n        current_counts(current_num) = 1\n\n        if (current_counts(current_num) == max_freq) then  ! if max_freq is 1\n\n            print *, v\n\n            stop\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nBut wait, in the case where max_freq is 1, the first occurrence of any element would have a count of 1. So the first element would be printed. But in the Java code, the first element that reaches max_freq in the second pass is printed. So this code should work.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nBut in Fortran, variables need to be declared. Let's code this step by step.\n\nBut first, note that in the Java code, the first pass uses a HashMap, and then the second pass uses another HashMap. The Fortran code will need to simulate these HashMaps with arrays and linear searches.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The elements in the array could be up to any integer, but in Fortran, integer size is limited. However, the Java code uses 'int', which is 32-bit. Fortran's default integer may be 32-bit as well, depending on the compiler. But assuming that the inputs are within Fortran's integer range.\n\n- The code assumes that the first occurrence of a count reaching max_freq in the second pass is the answer. Which matches the Java code's logic.\n\nSo the translated Fortran code would look something like this:\n\nprogram codeforces_637_A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, v, j, max_freq, current_num, found\n    integer, allocatable :: ara(:), elements(:), freqs(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: current_elements(:), current_counts(:)\n\n    ! Read input\n    read *, n\n    allocate(ara(n))\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) ara(i)\n    end do\n\n    ! First pass to count frequencies\n    allocate(elements(n), freqs(n))  ! Maximum possible size is n if all unique\n    elements = 0\n    freqs = 0\n    current_num = 0  ! acts as the count of unique elements so far\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        v = ara(i)\n        found = 0\n        do j = 1, current_num\n            if (elements(j) == v) then\n                freqs(j) = freqs(j) + 1\n                found = 1\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (found == 0) then\n            current_num = current_num + 1\n            elements(current_num) = v\n            freqs(current_num) = 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Find maximum frequency\n    max_freq = 0\n    do i = 1, current_num\n        if (freqs(i) > max_freq) then\n            max_freq = freqs(i)\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Second pass to find the first element reaching max_freq\n    allocate(current_elements(n), current_counts(n))\n    current_elements = 0\n    current_counts = 0\n    current_num = 0  ! reset for current elements\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        v = ara(i)\n        found = 0\n        do j = 1, current_num\n            if (current_elements(j) == v) then\n                current_counts(j) = current_counts(j) + 1\n                if (current_counts(j) == max_freq) then\n                    print *, v\n                    stop\n                end if\n                found = 1\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (found == 0) then\n            current_num = current_num + 1\n            current_elements(current_num) = v\n            current_counts(current_num) = 1\n            if (current_counts(current_num) == max_freq) then\n                print *, v\n                stop\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\nend program codeforces_637_A\n\nWait, but in the Fortran code, the 'current_num' variable is reused for the second pass. That's okay, since it's reset to 0 before the second loop.\n\nBut let me check variable names. The first pass uses elements, freqs, and current_num (which tracks the number of unique elements in the first pass). Then in the second pass, current_elements and current_counts are used, with current_num reset to 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThis code should work as per the Java code. Let me test with some examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput:\n5\n1 2 1 2 1\n\nFirst pass counts:\n\n1:3, 2:2. So max_freq is 3.\n\nSecond pass:\n\nProcess each element:\n\n1: added to current_elements (count 1). Since count is 1 !=3, continue.\n\n2: added (count 1, not 3).\n\n1: count becomes 2.\n\n2: count becomes 2.\n\n1: count becomes 3. Now, equals max_freq. So output 1 and exit.\n\nWhich matches the Java code's behavior.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n3\n3 3 2\n\nFirst pass: 3:2, 2:1. Max_freq is 2.\n\nSecond pass:\n\n3: count 1 (not 2).\n\n3: count becomes 2 (equals max_freq), so print 3 and exit.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case where max frequency is 1:\n\nInput:\n3\n1 2 3\n\nMax_freq is 1.\n\nSecond pass: first element 1 is added, count 1. So print 1 and exit.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should work."
