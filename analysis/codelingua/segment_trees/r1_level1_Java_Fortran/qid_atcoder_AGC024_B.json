    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Hmm. Let's start by understanding what the Java code is doing.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer N, then reads N integers into an array P. Each element is decremented by 1. Then, they create a map where the key is the value from P, and the value is its index. So, for each element in P, the map stores its position. Then, they check for consecutive numbers (i and i+1) in the range 0 to N-1, and see if their positions in the map are in decreasing order. If the position of i is greater than the position of i+1, then i is added to the nglist. \n\nThe nglist seems to collect the points where the sequence breaks the increasing order. Then, if nglist is empty, output 0. Otherwise, compute the minimal answer based on the elements in nglist. The initial ans is the minimum between (N - first ng element -1) and (last ng element +1). Then, for each consecutive pair in nglist, compute the sum of the first element +1 and N - next element -1, take the minimum of those with the current ans.\n\nSo the main steps are: read input, build the map, find the nglist, compute the answer based on the nglist.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about data structures. Java uses ArrayList and HashMap, but Fortran doesn't have built-in hash maps. Wait, but in the Java code, the map is used to store the value from P as the key, and the index as the value. Since P is an array where each element is unique (since it's a permutation?), because in the original code, the problem is likely about permutations. Because when they create the map, each P[i] is a key, and the value is i. So for example, if P is a permutation of 0..N-1, then the map is just the inverse permutation. So in Fortran, instead of a hash map, we can create an array where the index is the value from P, and the element is the position. Because P is a permutation, each value in P is unique and covers 0 to N-1. So we can replace the HashMap with a simple array. That's a key insight. So for example, in Java, map.get(i) would correspond to the array's (i+1)th element in Fortran (if using 1-based indexing). \n\nWait, Java uses 0-based indexing, and in the code, the P array is filled with values from 0 to N-1 (since each element is decremented by 1 when read). Then the map is built as map.put(P[i], i), which for each value in P (which is 0-based), maps to its index in the array. So for example, if P is [2,0,1], then the map would be (0 \u21921, 1\u21922, 2\u21920). So the map is effectively the inverse permutation. So in Fortran, we can create an array, say, inv_perm, where inv_perm(v) = i+1 (since Fortran is 1-based by default) if P[i] is v. Wait, original Java code uses 0-based. Let's think:\n\nIn Java, P is 0-based. So for i from 0 to N-1, P[i] is a permutation of 0..N-1. The map is key: P[i], value: i. So for each value v in 0..N-1, map.get(v) is the position where v occurs in P. So the inverse permutation array. So in Fortran, if we create an array, say, pos of size N, where pos(v+1) = i+1, since Fortran is 1-based. Wait, maybe in Fortran, the array can be 0-based if we declare it with indices starting at 0, but by default, arrays are 1-based. So perhaps it's easier to make the array 1-based. Let me think. Let's say in Fortran, the array pos is size N, and pos(k) gives the position (1-based) in the original array of the value (k-1). Because in Java, the map is for P[i] (0-based) to i (0-based). So to translate that to Fortran, perhaps for each element in P (which in Java is 0-based), we can have pos(P_java[i] +1) = i+1. Because if P_java[i] is 0-based (0..N-1), then in Fortran, we can index from 1 to N. So the array pos would have, for each value v (0-based in Java), pos(v+1) = i+1 (1-based position in Fortran). \n\nSo for example, if P in Java is [2,0,1], then pos(1) = 2 (because 0 is at index 1 in Java, but in Fortran, the position would be 2 (Java index 1 is the second element)), pos(2) =3, pos(3) =1. Wait, no. Let me recheck. Wait, in Java, the original code for P is filled with input values minus 1. So for example, if the input is 3, followed by 3 1 2, then P becomes [2,0,1]. Then, for each i (0-based), map.put(P[i], i). So for P[0]=2 \u2192 map.put(2, 0). So for v=2, the position is 0 (Java index). So in Fortran, the pos array would be such that pos(3) =1 (since 2+1=3, and Java index 0 becomes Fortran index 1). So pos(v_java +1) = i_java +1. So yes. So in Fortran, pos is an array of size N, where pos(k) is the position (1-based) in the original array where the value (k-1) is located. That way, pos(1) would correspond to the position of 0 (Java's 0) in the original array. \n\nSo replacing the HashMap with an array is the way to go. \n\nNext, the nglist is an ArrayList of integers. In Java, they loop from i=0 to N-2 (since it's N-1 in the loop condition), and check if map.get(i) > map.get(i+1). So for each i in 0..N-2, check if the position of i is after the position of i+1. If so, add i to nglist. \n\nIn Fortran, we can create a list (using an array, perhaps dynamic) to collect these i's. But since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays as easily, perhaps first determine the number of such elements by counting, and then filling an array, but for simplicity, since the maximum possible size of nglist is N-1, we can preallocate an array of size N-1. Alternatively, use a list structure. But perhaps easier to use an array and track the count. \n\nOnce the nglist is built, if it's empty, output 0. Otherwise, compute the minimal answer. \n\nThe initial ans is the minimum between (N - nglist(1) -1) and (nglist(last) +1). Wait, in Java, for the first element, it's nglist.get(0), which is the first element. Then N - nglist.get(0) -1. Let's see: N is the size of P. For example, if the first element is 3, then N -3-1= N-4. Hmm. But in Fortran, since the nglist array starts at index 1 if using 1-based. So we need to adjust the indices. \n\nIn Java, the code uses 0-based for the nglist. For example, nglist.get(0) is the first element. So in Fortran, if the nglist is stored in an array starting at 1, then the first element is at index 1, last is at index size. \n\nSo initial ans is min(N - nglist(1) -1, nglist(size) +1). Then for each consecutive pair in nglist (i and i+1 in the list), compute nglist(i) +1 + N - nglist(i+1) -1, and take the min with current ans. \n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be from i=1 to size-1, comparing nglist(i) and nglist(i+1). \n\nNow, the steps:\n\n1. Read N.\n\n2. Read N integers into array P, each element is input -1 (since Java code does P[i] = scan.nextInt() -1). But since in Fortran, perhaps the input is read as integers, and then subtracted by 1. \n\n3. Create the pos array (inverse permutation). For each i in 1..N (Fortran's indices), pos(P(i)+1) = i. Wait, because in Java, P[i] is the value (0-based), and in Fortran, the array is 1-based. For example, if in Java, P[0] is 2, then in Fortran, the first element is 2 (if we read into an array with 1-based indices). Then, pos(3) =1 (since 2 is the value, so pos(v+1) = i, where i is Fortran's index). \n\nWait, let me think. In Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) P[i] = scan.nextInt() -1;\n\nSo for example, if input is 3 1 2, then P becomes [2,0,1]. Then map.put(P[i], i), so for i=0 (Java index), P[i] is 2, so map.put(2,0). So in Fortran, pos(3) =1 (since 2+1=3, and i in Java is 0 \u2192 Fortran index 1). So in Fortran's pos array, the index is the value (0-based Java) plus 1, and the value is the position (Java index +1). So in Fortran:\n\npos = array of size N, where for each i (1..N), pos(P(i)+1) = i. Because P in Fortran is 1-based. For example, if in Fortran, P(1) = 2 (from Java code), then pos(3) =1. So, to build pos correctly:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    pos(P(i)+1) = i\nend do\n\nYes. Because P(i) is the Java value (0-based), so P(i) can be from 0 to N-1. So adding 1 gives 1 to N. So pos is an array of size N, and for each i from 1 to N, pos(v) = i, where v is the value (Java) +1.\n\nThen, the nglist is built by checking for each i from 0 to N-2 (Java) which corresponds to 1 to N-1 in Fortran's pos array. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn Java, for i from 0 to N-2 (i < N-1), check if map.get(i) > map.get(i+1). In Fortran, since pos maps the Java value (i) to the position (Java index +1), map.get(i) in Java is pos(i+1) in Fortran. Because for example, when Java's i is 0, pos(0+1) = pos(1) gives the position (Fortran index) of 0 in the array. So in Fortran, the equivalent check would be if pos(i) > pos(i+1) for i from 1 to N-1. Because i in Java is from 0 to N-2, which is i+1 in Fortran's pos array from 1 to N-1. So in Fortran, loop i from 1 to N-1, and check if pos(i) > pos(i+1). If so, add (i-1) to the nglist. Because in Java's code, the nglist adds i (Java's i) when map.get(i) > map.get(i+1). But in Fortran's pos array, i (Java) +1 = Fortran's pos index. So for example, Java's i=0 corresponds to Fortran's i=1. So if pos(1) > pos(2), then we need to add (i-1) to the nglist. So in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, N-1\n    if (pos(i) > pos(i+1)) then\n        nglist_count = nglist_count + 1\n        nglist(nglist_count) = i - 1\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, because in Java, when checking i and i+1 (Java's i and i+1), which correspond to Fortran's i and i+1 (since in the pos array, the index is the value +1). So for example, Java's i is 0, which is in the loop for i from 0 to N-2. Then, check if pos(1) (map.get(0)) > pos(2) (map.get(1)). If so, add i=0 to the nglist. So in Fortran, when checking i from 1 to N-1 (Java's i from 0 to N-2), and if pos(i) > pos(i+1), then add (i-1) to the nglist. Because i in the Fortran loop is (Java's i +1). So Java's i is (Fortran's loop i -1). So nglist stores Java's i values, which are (Fortran loop i -1). \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let's see:\n\nJava code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N-1; ++i) {\n    if (map.get(i) > map.get(i+1)) {\n        nglist.add(i);\n    }\n}\n\nBut in Fortran, the map.get(i) is pos(i+1) (since pos maps Java's i to the position +1). So for each Java i (0-based from 0 to N-2), check if pos(i+1) > pos(i+2). So in Fortran, loop i from 1 to N-1 (since i+1+1 is i+2?), wait no. Wait, Java's i ranges from 0 to N-2. The corresponding check is pos(i+1) > pos(i+2). So for Java i=0, check pos(1) > pos(2). For Java i= N-2, check pos(N-1) > pos(N). So in Fortran, we can loop i from 1 to N-1 (since Java i ranges from 0 to N-2 \u2192 N-1 terms), and check pos(i) > pos(i+1). So yes. Then, if this condition is true, the Java i is (i-1) in Fortran's loop. For example, Fortran's i=1 \u2192 Java i=0. So the nglist in Fortran should collect (i-1) in this case. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nnglist_count = 0\ndo i = 1, N-1\n    if (pos(i) > pos(i+1)) then\n        nglist_count = nglist_count + 1\n        nglist(nglist_count) = i-1\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, if nglist_count is 0, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nThe initial ans is min(N - nglist(1) -1, nglist(nglist_count) +1). \n\nWait, in Java, the first element of nglist is nglist.get(0), which is the Java i. The initial ans is min(N - nglist.get(0) -1, nglist.get(nglist.size()-1) +1). \n\nIn Fortran, nglist is 1-based. So the first element is nglist(1), which is Java i. So N - nglist(1) -1. Because in Java, the code does N - nglist.get(0) -1. For example, if nglist(1) is 3 (Java i=3), then N -3 -1 = N-4. \n\nThe other part is nglist(nglist_count) +1. Because nglist.get(nglist.size()-1) is the last element of the Java list. So in Fortran, it's nglist(nglist_count). So ans is min(N - nglist(1) -1, nglist(nglist_count) +1). \n\nThen, loop over consecutive elements in nglist. For Java, it's from i=0 to nglist.size()-2. For each pair nglist.get(i) and nglist.get(i+1), compute nglist.get(i) +1 + N - nglist.get(i+1) -1. Then take the min with ans. \n\nIn Fortran, the loop is from i=1 to nglist_count-1. For each pair nglist(i) and nglist(i+1), compute nglist(i) +1 + N - nglist(i+1) -1. Then compare with ans. \n\nSo putting this all together.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to handle dynamic arrays. For nglist, since the maximum possible size is N-1 (if every i from 0 to N-2 is in the nglist), we can preallocate an array of size N. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(N) :: nglist\ninteger :: nglist_count\n\nThen, after the loop, if nglist_count is 0, print 0. Else proceed. \n\nNow, translating the code step by step.\n\nFirst, read N.\n\nThen read N integers, subtract 1 from each, store in P array (Fortran 1-based). \n\nThen create the pos array. \n\nThen build nglist. \n\nThen compute the answer. \n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Fortran's array indices start at 1. So need to adjust indices accordingly. \n\nNow, code structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, temp, nglist_count, ans, current\n    integer, allocatable :: P(:), pos(:), nglist(:)\n    read *, N\n    allocate(P(N))\n    do i = 1, N\n        read *, temp\n        P(i) = temp -1  ! Convert to 0-based as in Java\n    end do\n    allocate(pos(N))\n    do i = 1, N\n        pos(P(i)+1) = i  ! Because P(i) is 0-based (Java's P[i])\n    end do\n    allocate(nglist(N-1))  ! Maximum possible size\n    nglist_count = 0\n    do i = 1, N-1\n        if (pos(i) > pos(i+1)) then\n            nglist_count = nglist_count +1\n            nglist(nglist_count) = i-1  ! Because i in Fortran's loop is Java's i+1\n        end if\n    end do\n    if (nglist_count == 0) then\n        print *, 0\n        stop\n    end if\n    ans = min(N - nglist(1) -1, nglist(nglist_count) +1)\n    do i =1, nglist_count-1\n        current = nglist(i) +1 + (N - nglist(i+1) -1)\n        if (current < ans) ans = current\n    end do\n    print *, ans\nend program\n\nWait, but let's test this code with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n2 1 3\n\nIn Java, the code reads N=3, then P becomes [1,0,2] (since each element is subtracted by 1). Then map is built as follows: P[0] is 1 \u2192 map.put(1,0). P[1] is 0 \u2192 map.put(0,1). P[2] is 2 \u2192 map.put(2,2). So map is {0:1, 1:0, 2:2}. Then, checking for i from 0 to 1 (N-1 is 3, so N-2 is 1). For i=0: map.get(0)=1 > map.get(1)=0 \u2192 yes, add to nglist. For i=1: map.get(1)=0 < map.get(2)=2 \u2192 no. So nglist has [0]. Then ans is min(3-0-1, 0+1) \u2192 min(2,1) \u2192 1. So output is 1.\n\nLet's see how the Fortran code handles this.\n\nIn Fortran, P is read as [1,0,2]. Then pos array:\n\npos(1) \u2192 0-based value 0: which is at P(2) \u2192 pos(0+1) = 2.\n\npos(2) \u2192 value 1: in P(1), so pos(2) =1.\n\npos(3) \u2192 value 2: in P(3), so pos(3) =3.\n\nThen, loop i from 1 to 2 (N-1=2):\n\ni=1: check pos(1) (2) > pos(2) (1) \u2192 yes. nglist_count becomes 1, nglist(1) =0.\n\ni=2: check pos(2) (1) > pos(3) (3) \u2192 no. So nglist has [0].\n\nThen ans is min(3-0 -1, 0 +1) \u2192 min(2,1) \u21921. Which matches.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n5\n\n3 5 1 4 2\n\nJava's code: N=5. P becomes [2,4,0,3,1]. Then map is:\n\n0 \u2192 index 2\n\n1 \u2192 index 4\n\n2 \u2192 index 0\n\n3 \u2192 index 3\n\n4 \u2192 index1.\n\nSo map.get(0) =2, map.get(1)=4, etc.\n\nCheck i from 0 to 3:\n\ni=0: map.get(0)=2 vs map.get(1)=4 \u2192 2 <4 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: map.get(1)=4 vs map.get(2)=0 \u21924>0 \u2192 yes, add 1 to nglist.\n\ni=2: map.get(2)=0 vs map.get(3)=3 \u21920 <3 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3: map.get(3)=3 vs map.get(4)=1 \u21923>1 \u2192 add 3.\n\nSo nglist is [1,3].\n\nThen ans is min(5-1-1=3, 3+1=4) \u21923. Then check pairs:\n\n1 and 3: 1+1 +5-3-1= 2 +1=3. So ans becomes 3. So output is 3.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nP is [2,4,0,3,1]. So P(1)=2, P(2)=4, P(3)=0, P(4)=3, P(5)=1. So pos array:\n\npos(1) \u2192 value 0 is at P(3) \u2192 pos(0+1)=3.\n\npos(2) \u2192 value 1 is at P(5) \u2192 pos(1+1)=5.\n\npos(3) \u2192 value 2 is at P(1) \u2192 pos(3) =1.\n\npos(4) \u2192 value3 is at P(4) \u21924.\n\npos(5) \u2192 value4 is at P(2) \u21922.\n\nNow loop i from1 to4 (N-1=5-1=4).\n\nCheck pos(i) > pos(i+1):\n\ni=1: pos(1)=3, pos(2)=5 \u21923 <5 \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: pos(2)=5, pos(3)=1 \u21925>1 \u2192 yes. nglist_count=1, nglist(1)=1 (i-1=2-1=1).\n\ni=3: pos(3)=1, pos(4)=4 \u21921 <4 \u2192 no.\n\ni=4: pos(4)=4, pos(5)=2 \u21924>2 \u2192 yes. nglist_count=2, nglist(2)=4-1=3.\n\nSo nglist is [1,3].\n\nans = min(5 -1 -1=3, 3+1=4) \u21923.\n\nThen loop i=1 to nglist_count-1=1:\n\ncurrent = nglist(1) +1 + (5 - nglist(2) -1) \u21921+1 + (5-3-1) =2 +1=3. So ans is 3.\n\nSo output is 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nOther edge cases: when nglist is empty. For example, when the sequence is already increasing. So the code outputs 0.\n\nAnother case: when nglist has multiple elements. \n\nSo the Fortran code should handle this correctly.\n\nPotential issues: array indices, 1-based vs 0-based. The key part is building the pos array correctly.\n\nThus, the translated Fortran code should be as follows."
