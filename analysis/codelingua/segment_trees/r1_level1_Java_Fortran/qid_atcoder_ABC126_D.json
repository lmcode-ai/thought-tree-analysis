    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, Java uses classes and objects, which Fortran doesn't handle in the same way. So I'll have to find a way to represent the data structures using Fortran's features.\n\nThe original code has a Point class with a name and a map of friends (which are other Points and the length of the edge). The main logic reads input, builds the graph, then performs a DFS to color the nodes based on the parity of the cumulative path length.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to represent the Points in Fortran. Since Fortran doesn't have classes, maybe I can use derived types. Each Point would need an array to track its connected nodes and the lengths. But in Java, each Point has a map of friends; in Fortran, perhaps for each node, I can have a list of connected nodes and their lengths. So maybe arrays of arrays, or arrays of structures.\n\nWait, maybe create a derived type for edges. For each node, store an array of edges, each containing a target node and a length. Then, have an array of such edge lists for all nodes.\n\nSo, first, in Fortran, I can define a type for edges:\n\ntype Edge\n    integer :: to\n    integer :: length\nend type Edge\n\nThen, have an array of arrays of Edge types to represent the adjacency list. For example, adjacency_list(i) would be an array of Edge elements representing the connections from node i.\n\nThen, the colors array can be a simple integer array, initialized to -1, similar to the Java code.\n\nThe DFS function in Java is recursive. Fortran can handle recursion, but I need to make sure the stack doesn't get too deep. But given that the problem is for a tree (n up to 1e5?), but in practice, the sample inputs might be small. Wait, the original code uses recursion for DFS, which for large n could cause stack overflow. But in Fortran, perhaps the default stack size is smaller, so maybe an iterative approach is better. But the Java code is using recursion, so perhaps the problem expects a tree structure where recursion depth is manageable. However, since the user provided code uses recursion, perhaps we can proceed with a recursive approach in Fortran.\n\nBut Fortran's recursion handling is a bit more involved. The recursive subroutine needs to be declared as recursive. So the DFS subroutine will be recursive.\n\nNow, the main steps:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n2. Initialize colors array to -1.\n3. Read n-1 edges, each connecting two nodes (u and v) with a length. Since the nodes are 0-based in Java, perhaps 1-based in Fortran? Wait, in the Java code, the nodes are 0-based (since when reading, me = sc.nextInt() -1). So in Fortran, maybe keep 0-based indexing? Or switch to 1-based. But arrays in Fortran can be 0-based. Let's stick with 0-based.\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading input, the user inputs integers like u and v, which are then decremented by 1. So perhaps in Fortran, the nodes are 0-based.\n\nSo, the adjacency list will be an array of arrays (or arrays of Edge types) where each element corresponds to a node. For each edge, add both directions (since the graph is undirected). But in the Java code, when adding an edge between me and you, both points add each other to their friends list. So in Fortran, for each edge (u, v, length), add v to u's adjacency list with the length, and u to v's adjacency list with the same length.\n\nThen, the DFS starts at node 0. For each node, if the color is not set (-1), set it based on the cumulative length mod 2. Then, recursively visit all neighbors, adding the current edge's length to the cumulative.\n\nSo, translating the DFS function: in Java, it's a static method that takes a Point and a length. The Fortran version will need to track the current node and the cumulative length. But since Fortran doesn't have objects, the adjacency list is a global structure, and the colors array is a module variable or passed around.\n\nBut in Fortran, passing arrays around can be done via arguments. However, for recursion, using module variables might be easier. Alternatively, use a module to hold the adjacency list and colors.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Define a module that contains the adjacency_list and colors array.\n\nBut in the Java code, colors is a static array. In Fortran, using a module to hold these variables would make sense.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Initialize adjacency_list as an array of Edge arrays. For each node, adjacency_list(node) is an array of Edge elements.\n\n- Read each of the n-1 edges. For each, read u, v, length. Convert u and v to 0-based by subtracting 1. Then add an Edge from u to v with length, and from v to u with length.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the edges are stored in each Point's friends map, which includes both directions. So in Fortran, the adjacency list is built similarly.\n\nOnce the adjacency list is built, perform the DFS starting at node 0 with initial length 0.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the initial call is dfs(points[0], 0). The points[0] is the node 0, and the initial length is 0. Then, for each friend, the cumulative length is the current length plus the edge's length.\n\nWait, the Java code's DFS function's 'length' parameter is the cumulative sum from the root to the current node. Then, for each neighbor, the edge's length is added to that cumulative sum. So the color is determined based on the parity of the cumulative sum from the root.\n\nAh, so the color of a node is based on the sum of the lengths along the path from the root (node 0) to that node. If the sum is even, color 0; else 1.\n\nSo, the initial call starts with 0, and each step adds the edge's length to the cumulative sum when moving to the child.\n\nBut in the Java code, the root's color is set to 0 (since 0 mod 2 is 0), then each neighbor is processed.\n\nSo, the Fortran code needs to model this.\n\nBut how to handle the adjacency list and the colors array.\n\nSo, the plan:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Initialize colors array (size n) to -1.\n\n3. Read n-1 edges. For each edge, read u, v, w. Then add to adjacency_list for u+1 and v+1 (if the input is 1-based) or u and v (if input is 0-based). Wait, the Java code subtracts 1 from the input integers to get 0-based indices.\n\nSo in the original code, the input for nodes is 1-based, converted to 0-based.\n\nSo, in Fortran, when reading the input, read u, v, w, then subtract 1 from u and v to make them 0-based.\n\nThen, for each u and v, add an edge to each other's adjacency list with length w.\n\nOnce all edges are read, perform a DFS starting from node 0 with cumulative length 0.\n\nIn the DFS function:\n\nIf the current node's color is not -1, return (already processed).\n\nSet the color based on the cumulative length mod 2.\n\nThen, for each neighbor (edge) in the adjacency list of the current node, recursively call DFS on the neighbor node with cumulative length plus the edge's length.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, when visiting a neighbor, the cumulative length is the parent's cumulative length plus the edge's length. So in the example, when processing node 0, which has a cumulative length of 0, the edge's length is added to that, and passed to the neighbor. The neighbor's color is set based on (parent's cumulative + edge length) mod 2.\n\nWait, but in Java code:\n\nIn the main, the initial call is dfs(points[0], 0). So the starting node is 0, with cumulative length 0.\n\nIn the dfs function:\n\nIf the node's color is known, return.\n\nSet the color based on the current length (0) mod 2 (0, so color 0).\n\nThen, for each friend (edge), it adds the edge's length to the current length (0) and passes that to the friend's dfs.\n\nSo, for example, if the neighbor's edge length is 3, the cumulative length passed to it is 0 + 3 = 3. Then, the neighbor's color is 3 mod 2 = 1.\n\nSo, the color depends on the sum of edge lengths from the root to the current node.\n\nSo, the DFS in Fortran will need to track the current node and the cumulative length.\n\nBut how to represent the adjacency list. Let's think.\n\nIn Fortran, we can have an array of arrays, but Fortran's dynamic arrays can be handled with allocatable arrays. For each node, the adjacency list is a list of edges (to and length).\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nDefine a derived type:\n\ntype Edge\n    integer :: to\n    integer :: length\nend type Edge\n\nThen, the adjacency list is an array of arrays of Edge:\n\ntype(Edge), allocatable :: adjacency_list(:,:)\n\nBut no, in Fortran, you can have an array of arrays using allocatable arrays. So each element of adjacency_list is an allocatable array of Edge.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ntype(Edge), allocatable :: adjacency_list(:,:)\n\nBut no, that's a 2D array. Alternatively, an array of pointers to arrays of Edge.\n\nBut in Fortran, you can have an array of allocatable arrays. Like:\n\ntype EdgeArray\n    type(Edge), allocatable :: edges(:)\nend type EdgeArray\n\ntype(EdgeArray), allocatable :: adjacency_list(:)\n\nThen, adjacency_list(i) is an EdgeArray, and adjacency_list(i)%edges is the list of edges for node i.\n\nYes, that's possible.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Allocate adjacency_list(0:n-1), since nodes are 0-based.\n\n3. For each node, adjacency_list(i)%edges is initialized as an empty array.\n\n4. Read n-1 edges. For each edge:\n\n   a. Read u, v, w. Subtract 1 from u and v to get 0-based.\n\n   b. Add an Edge to adjacency_list(u)%edges with to = v and length = w.\n\n   c. Add an Edge to adjacency_list(v)%edges with to = u and length = w.\n\nWait, but in Java, each edge is added to both nodes. So in Fortran, same thing.\n\nOnce the adjacency list is built, perform the DFS starting at node 0 with cumulative length 0.\n\nThe colors array is initialized to -1.\n\nThe DFS function:\n\nrecursive subroutine dfs(node, length)\n    integer, intent(in) :: node, length\n    if (colors(node) /= -1) return\n    colors(node) = mod(length, 2)\n    do i = 1, size(adjacency_list(node)%edges)\n        edge = adjacency_list(node)%edges(i)\n        call dfs(edge%to, length + edge%length)\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nBut in Fortran, the recursion must be declared with the 'recursive' keyword.\n\nSo, the subroutine is:\n\nrecursive subroutine dfs(node, cumulative_length)\n    integer, intent(in) :: node, cumulative_length\n    integer :: i\n    type(Edge) :: e\n\n    if (colors(node) /= -1) return\n\n    colors(node) = mod(cumulative_length, 2)\n\n    do i = 1, size(adjacency_list(node)%edges)\n        e = adjacency_list(node)%edges(i)\n        call dfs(e%to, cumulative_length + e%length)\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nBut how to handle the adjacency list and colors in the subroutine. Since they are in a module, perhaps.\n\nYes, we can create a module that holds the adjacency_list and colors.\n\nSo the module would look like:\n\nmodule graph\n    type Edge\n        integer :: to\n        integer :: length\n    end type Edge\n\n    type EdgeArray\n        type(Edge), allocatable :: edges(:)\n    end type EdgeArray\n\n    type(EdgeArray), allocatable :: adjacency_list(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: colors(:)\nend module graph\n\nThen, in the main program and the dfs subroutine, use this module.\n\nSo the overall steps are:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Allocate adjacency_list(0:n-1) and initialize each as an allocatable array of Edge.\n\nWait, no. The adjacency_list is an array of EdgeArray, each of which has an edges array.\n\nSo:\n\nallocate(adjacency_list(0:n-1))\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to n-1, adjacency_list(i)%edges is initially not allocated. For each edge added, we need to append to the edges array.\n\nBut appending to arrays in Fortran is a bit cumbersome. Since each time we read an edge, we need to add two entries (u to v and v to u), we can use the following approach for each edge:\n\nFor u and v:\n\nFor the adjacency_list(u)%edges, append an Edge with to=v and length=w.\n\nSimilarly for adjacency_list(v)%edges, append an Edge with to=u and length=w.\n\nTo append, perhaps:\n\ntemp = [Edge(v, w)]\nif (allocated(adjacency_list(u)%edges)) then\n    adjacency_list(u)%edges = [adjacency_list(u)%edges, temp]\nelse\n    adjacency_list(u)%edges = temp\nend if\n\nSame for v.\n\nBut this approach can be inefficient, but for the purpose of code translation, perhaps acceptable.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe code:\n\nmodule graph\n    implicit none\n    type :: Edge\n        integer :: to\n        integer :: length\n    end type Edge\n\n    type :: EdgeArray\n        type(Edge), allocatable :: edges(:)\n    end type EdgeArray\n\n    type(EdgeArray), allocatable :: adjacency_list(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: colors(:)\nend module graph\n\nprogram main\n    use graph\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, i, u, v, w\n    type(Edge), allocatable :: temp_edges(:)\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    m = n - 1\n\n    allocate(adjacency_list(0:n-1))\n    allocate(colors(0:n-1))\n    colors = -1\n\n    do i = 1, m\n        read(*,*) u, v, w\n        u = u - 1  ! convert to 0-based\n        v = v - 1\n\n        ! Add u -> v edge\n        if (allocated(adjacency_list(u)%edges)) then\n            adjacency_list(u)%edges = [adjacency_list(u)%edges, Edge(v, w)]\n        else\n            adjacency_list(u)%edges = [Edge(v, w)]\n        end if\n\n        ! Add v -> u edge\n        if (allocated(adjacency_list(v)%edges)) then\n            adjacency_list(v)%edges = [adjacency_list(v)%edges, Edge(u, w)]\n        else\n            adjacency_list(v)%edges = [Edge(u, w)]\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    call dfs(0, 0)\n\n    do i = 0, n-1\n        print *, colors(i)\n    end do\n\ncontains\n\n    recursive subroutine dfs(node, cumulative_length)\n        integer, intent(in) :: node, cumulative_length\n        integer :: i\n        type(Edge) :: e\n\n        if (colors(node) /= -1) return\n\n        colors(node) = mod(cumulative_length, 2)\n\n        if (.not. allocated(adjacency_list(node)%edges)) return\n\n        do i = 1, size(adjacency_list(node)%edges)\n            e = adjacency_list(node)%edges(i)\n            call dfs(e%to, cumulative_length + e%length)\n        end do\n    end subroutine dfs\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So when we loop through adjacency_list(node)%edges, which is an array, the indices start at 1. So in the loop, i goes from 1 to size(...).\n\nThat's correct.\n\nBut when building the adjacency_list, each time we append an edge, the array starts at 1.\n\nNow, testing edge cases:\n\nIf n=1, then m=0, no edges. Then, adjacency_list is allocated for 0..0 (size 1), but no edges. The dfs is called on node 0 with cumulative 0. The color is set to 0 mod 2 = 0. Then, printed.\n\nWhich matches the Java code.\n\nAnother case: for a tree with two nodes.\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n1 2 3\n\nThen, u=0, v=1. Both nodes have edges to each other with length 3.\n\nDFS starts at 0, cumulative 0. color[0] = 0.\n\nThen, process edges of 0: edge to 1 with length 3.\n\nCall dfs(1, 0+3=3). color[1] is -1. Set to 3 mod 2 =1.\n\nEdges of 1: edge back to 0. But when we call dfs(0, 3 +3=6). But color[0] is already 0, so return.\n\nThus, colors are 0 and 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle this.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling 0-based indices correctly.\n\n- Appending to the edges array. Each time we add a new edge, we create a new array by concatenating the existing edges with the new one. This can be inefficient for large n, but since the original Java code uses a similar approach (adding to a HashMap each time), perhaps acceptable.\n\nAnother possible optimization is to preallocate the edges array with a certain size and track the count, but for code simplicity, the current approach is manageable.\n\nThus, the translated Fortran code should work as intended."
