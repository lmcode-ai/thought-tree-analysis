    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the original code first.\n\nThe Java code reads an integer t for the number of test cases. Then for each test case, it reads an integer n and prints the result of maxLeft(n). The maxLeft function returns n-2 if n>2, else 0.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the Fortran program similarly. Fortran has a main program and functions or subroutines. Let's start by setting up the main program.\n\nIn Fortran, reading input can be done with READ(*,*). So, the first step is to read t. Then loop t times, each time reading n and printing the result of maxLeft(n).\n\nFor the function maxLeft, since it's a simple calculation, I can write it as a function. In Fortran, functions can be declared. The function will take an integer n and return an integer result. The condition is: if n > 2, return n-2, else 0.\n\nLet me structure this. The program will have:\n\n- A main program that reads t, loops t times.\n- Inside the loop, read n, compute the result, print it.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Declare variables: t, n, i as integers.\n2. Read t from input.\n3. Loop i from 1 to t (Fortran loops are usually 1-based, but Java uses 0-based. But since the loop is just t times, it doesn't matter as long as it runs t iterations).\n4. For each iteration, read n, compute the result using the function, then print it.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you read with READ(*,*), you need to make sure the variables are properly passed. Also, the function maxLeft needs to be declared. In Fortran, functions can be placed after the contains statement within a program.\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_23_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: t, n, i, result\n    read(*,*) t\n    do i = 1, t\n        read(*,*) n\n        result = maxLeft(n)\n        print *, result\n    end do\ncontains\n    integer function maxLeft(n)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        if (n > 2) then\n            maxLeft = n - 2\n        else\n            maxLeft = 0\n        end if\n    end function maxLeft\nend program codeforces_23_B\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you have a function inside a program, you need to declare its return type. Alternatively, the function can be inside the contains section. Also, variables in Fortran are case-insensitive, but the code here uses lowercase, which is fine.\n\nTesting this code: For example, if n=1, returns 0; n=3 returns 1. The original Java code's function is correct.\n\nBut wait, the original Java code's maxLeft returns n-2 when n>2, else 0. So for n=3, 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should work. Let me check for possible errors.\n\nAnother thing: The function maxLeft is declared with integer function maxLeft(n). The 'implicit none' is important to avoid implicit typing. The contains statement includes the function within the program.\n\nYes, this should work. Let me write this as the final answer."
