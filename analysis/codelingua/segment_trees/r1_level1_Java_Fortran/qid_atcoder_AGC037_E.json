So in Fortran, when building the substrings from revU, which is reversed (S//T), we need to extract N-length substrings starting at different positions.

The Java code's input is supposed to be correct, so we can assume S is length N.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nS = buffer(1:N)\n\nBut to be safe, after reading the buffer, take the first N characters. So the code:\n\ninteger :: N, K, step, i_java, i\ncharacter(len=200000) :: buffer\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: S, T, revU, sDash, tmp\nlogical :: firstTime\n\nread(*,*) N, K\nread(*, '(a)') buffer\nS = buffer(1:N) firstTime = .true.\nstep = 1\n\ndo while (K > 0)\n\n   ! Generate T as reverse of S\n   T = S(len(S):1:-1)\n\n   !",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads two integers N and K, then a string S. The main loop runs K times, but there's some condition with step and firstTime. The code seems to generate some transformed strings and find the minimal one under certain conditions. There's also a part where if it's the first time and 2^K is larger than N, it outputs the first character of sDash repeated N times. \n\nHmm. Let's break down the steps. \n\nThe main challenge here is dealing with string manipulations in Fortran, which is a bit different from Java. Java uses StringBuilder with methods like reverse(), substring(), and compareTo(). Fortran doesn't have these built-in, so I'll have to implement them manually.\n\nLet's start by translating the variables. The Java code uses N, K, S (as a StringBuilder), firstTime (boolean), step. In Fortran, variables can be declared with appropriate types. For strings, we'll need character arrays or allocatable strings. \n\nIn the Java code, S is a StringBuilder. So in Fortran, we'll use a character variable, perhaps of sufficient length or dynamically allocated. Since Fortran strings are fixed-length, but we can work with substrings. \n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read N, K, and the string S. In Fortran, reading a string might require knowing its length in advance. The original Java code uses sc.next(), which reads the next token. So assuming S is a single word without spaces. So in Fortran, we can read it with a format like '(A)'.\n\n2. The loop runs while K > 0. Each iteration modifies S and K decreases by 1. But there's a step variable that can affect how the loop proceeds.\n\n3. T is the reverse of S. Then revU is S concatenated with T, then reversed again. So revU in Java is (S + T).reverse(). Wait, let's see:\n\nIn Java code:\nT is S reversed. revU is S + T, then reversed. So for example, if S is \"abc\", T is \"cba\", S+T is \"abccba\", reversed revU would be \"abccba\" reversed is \"abccba\"? Wait no. Wait, S + T is \"abc\" + \"cba\" = \"abccba\". Then revU is that reversed, which would be \"abccba\" reversed again, which is \"abccba\" again. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's check:\n\nOriginal S is \"abc\". Then T is reverse of S, which is \"cba\". Then revU is S.toString() + T.toString() = \"abccba\". Then revU.reverse() would make it \"acbcba\"? Wait, no. Wait, when you reverse \"abccba\", the result is \"abccba\" because it's a palindrome. So maybe in that example, revU becomes the same as S+T. But for non-palindromic S, it's different. So revU is the reverse of the concatenation of S and T. \n\nBut then, in the Java code, they loop from i = N down to 0 in steps of step, taking the substring i to i + N. Wait, the original code is in Java:\n\nrevU is S + T reversed. Then revU is reversed again. So for example, S is \"abc\", T is \"cba\", S + T is \"abccba\". Then revU is the reverse of that, which would be \"abccba\" reversed is \"abccba\". Then revU is that. Then when they take revU.substring(i, i + N), they get a substring of length N. \n\nBut maybe I need to think about how to reverse strings in Fortran. So for a given string, to reverse it, I can loop from the end to the beginning and build the reversed string. \n\nAnother thing to note is that in Java, the step variable starts at 1 and can be doubled. The loop for i in Java starts at N, steps down by step each time (i -= step). So for each K, they generate sDash by checking various substrings and selecting the minimal one. \n\nThe firstTime flag is used to check if it's the first iteration. If it is, and if 2^K is greater than N, then output the first character of sDash repeated N times. Otherwise, proceed. \n\nSo translating all this to Fortran requires handling strings, reversing them, concatenating, and comparing substrings. \n\nLet's start by setting up the variables in Fortran. \n\nIn Fortran, variables can be declared as:\n\ninteger :: N, K, step\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: S, T, revU, sDash\nlogical :: firstTime\n\nBut since Fortran strings are fixed-length, we might need to preallocate enough space. For example, S is the original string of length N. T is the reverse of S, also length N. revU is S concatenated with T (length 2N), then reversed, so length 2N. \n\nWait, in Java code, revU is the reverse of (S + T). So in Fortran, to get revU, we can concatenate S and T, then reverse the entire string. \n\nSo for example, S is \"abc\", T is \"cba\", S//T is \"abccba\", reversed would be \"abccba\" again. But if S is \"ab\", T is \"ba\", S//T is \"abba\", reversed is \"abba\". So for even-length S, perhaps. \n\nBut in any case, the revU is the reversed version of S concatenated with T. \n\nNow, in the Java loop, for each i from N down to 0 (step steps), extract the substring from i to i+N (exclusive in Java's substring, which is [i, i+N)), which is of length N. Then compare each tmp to sDash and keep the minimal one. \n\nSo in Fortran, substrings are handled with (start:end). So to get the substring from i+1 to i+N (since Java uses 0-based, Fortran 1-based), perhaps. Wait, Java's substring(i, i+N) starts at index i (inclusive) and ends at index i+N (exclusive). So the length is N. So in Fortran, if the original string is of length 2N, then the substring starting at i+1 (since Java's i is 0-based) would be revU(i+1:i+N). Wait, but in Java, when i is up to N, the maximum i + N would be N + N = 2N. So when i is N, the substring is from N to 2N-1 in Java, which is length N. \n\nSo in Fortran, revU is a string of length 2*N. The substrings start at positions from 1 to N+1 (since when i is N in Java, which is 0-based, then in Fortran it's i+1 = N+1. Wait, wait, in Java code, the loop is for (int i = N; i >= 0; i -= step). So i starts at N (Java 0-based?), but the code says N, K are read as integers. Wait, the Java code's N is read from input, which is the length of the string. The initial S has length N. \n\nWait, the Java code reads S as sc.next(), which is the initial string. Then, in the code, when building revU, S is concatenated with T (which is reversed S), so S and T are each length N, making revU length 2N. Then revU is reversed, so it's a string of length 2N. Then, when extracting substrings of revU from i to i+N (exclusive), which is N characters. So i can range from 0 to N, inclusive? Because when i is N, the substring is from N to N + N = 2N, which is exactly the last N characters. \n\nBut in Java, the loop is i starts at N and steps down by step. Wait, the loop is written as for (int i = N; i >= 0; i -= step). So i starts at N, then N-step, etc., until it's >=0. \n\nSo in Fortran, when building the substrings from revU, which is reversed (S//T), we need to extract N-length substrings starting at different positions. \n\nSo in Fortran, after creating revU (which is the reversed (S//T)), the loop would iterate i from N down to 0 (Java's i), but since Fortran is 1-based, perhaps we need to adjust. Wait, in Java, revU is of length 2N, so indices are 0 to 2N-1. When taking substring(i, i+N), the starting index is i, ending index is i+N (exclusive). So the characters are at positions i, i+1, ..., i+N-1. \n\nIn Fortran, revU is a string of length 2N. So the equivalent substring would be revU(i+1 : i+N). Because in Fortran, the indices are 1-based. For example, Java's i=0 corresponds to Fortran's 1: i+1=1, and the substring is 1:N. Similarly, when i=N in Java, the substring is N:2N-1 (Java indices). In Fortran, that would be (N+1) : (N+1 + N -1) = N+1 : 2N. \n\nWait, in Java's revU, when i is N, the substring is from index N to N + N = 2N (exclusive), so indices N to 2N-1. That's N characters. So in Fortran, revU is a string of length 2N, so the substring would be revU(N+1 : 2N). \n\nSo the loop in Java runs i from N down to 0, stepping by step. So in Fortran, perhaps the loop would be do i = N, 0, -step, but adjusted for 1-based indices. Wait, no. Wait, Java's i is in 0-based. So when the Java code has i=N (the initial value), that's N in 0-based terms. So the first substring starts at i=N, which in Java is revU's index N, and takes N characters. \n\nSo in Fortran, the equivalent starting position would be i_java + 1 = N+1. So the loop in Fortran would need to start at i_start = N+1, then decrement by step each time. Wait, but step is in terms of Java's indices. Or perhaps, since in Fortran, the step is the same as in Java, but the indices are shifted by 1. \n\nHmm. Let's see: the loop in Java is for (int i = N; i >=0; i -= step). For each i, the substring is revU.substring(i, i + N). So in Fortran, the starting position is i+1 (Java's 0-based to Fortran's 1-based). The length of the substring is N. So the substring is revU(i+1 : i+N). Wait, but if i+1 to i+N would be correct? For example, when i is 0 (Java), then the substring is 0 to N-1 in Java (0-based), which is length N. In Fortran, that's 1 to N. So yes, for Java's i, the Fortran substring starts at i+1 and has length N. \n\nSo in the Java code, the loop for i from N down to 0, steps of step. For each i, the substring is revU.substring(i, i+N). \n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\ndo i = N, 0, -step\n   tmp = revU(i+1 : i+N)\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, when i starts at N (Java's i=N), the starting index is N+1. But if revU is length 2N, then i+1 + N-1 = N+1 + N-1 = 2N, which is the end of the string. So that's correct. \n\nBut how to handle the loop? For example, in Fortran, the loop variable has to be an integer. So perhaps in Fortran, the loop variable i_java starts at N and steps down by step, and the starting index in Fortran is i_java +1. \n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would look something like:\n\ni_java = N\ndo while (i_java >= 0)\n   tmp = revU(i_java+1 : i_java + N)\n   ! compare and update sDash\n   i_java = i_java - step\nend do\n\nBut how to implement this loop structure in Fortran? Because the loop is not a simple step loop. Well, the Java code's for loop is:\n\nfor (int i = N; i >=0; i -= step)\n\nWhich can be translated to a do-while loop in Fortran. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ni_java = N\ndo while (i_java >= 0)\n   ! process\n   i_java = i_java - step\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the main steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read N, K, S.\n\n2. Initialize firstTime as .true., step as 1.\n\n3. While K > 0:\n\n   a. T = reverse(S)\n   b. revU = reverse(S // T)\n   c. sDash = S\n\n   d. loop i_java from N down to 0 step step:\n\n      i. tmp = substring of revU starting at i_java+1, length N\n      ii. compare tmp with sDash lexicographically. If tmp is smaller, set sDash = tmp. Else, if not firstTime, break the loop.\n\n   e. if firstTime is .true.:\n\n      i. set firstTime to .false.\n      ii. if 2^K > N, then output the first character of sDash N times and exit.\n\n   f. else:\n\n      i. step = step * 2\n\n   g. K = K -1\n\n   h. S = reverse(sDash)\n\n4. After the loop, output S reversed.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after each K iteration, S is set to sDash reversed. Then, after all K steps, output S reversed again. So the final output is reverse(S), which would be reverse(reverse(sDash)) = sDash. Wait, no. Let me check the Java code:\n\nAt the end of the loop:\n\nS is set to new StringBuilder(sDash).reverse();\n\nThen, after K steps, the code does System.out.println(S.reverse());\n\nSo S is reversed again. So the final output is sDash reversed twice, which is sDash. Or wait, no. Let's track:\n\nEach iteration of K:\n\nS is assigned sDash reversed.\n\nAt the next K iteration, sDash is computed, then S becomes sDash reversed again.\n\nAfter K steps, the code reverses S again and prints. So for example, if K=1, then after processing, S is sDash reversed. Then, S.reverse() is printed, which is sDash.\n\nBut perhaps the final output is S reversed. So in Fortran, after the loop, we need to reverse the current S and output.\n\nSo the steps for each K iteration:\n\n- Generate T as reversed S.\n\n- Generate revU as reversed (S // T). So revU is the reverse of the concatenated S and T.\n\n- Then, for various i, extract substrings of revU of length N, compare to find the minimal sDash.\n\n- Then, if firstTime, check if 2^K > N, in which case output the first character of sDash N times.\n\n- Else, update step.\n\n- K decreases by 1.\n\n- S becomes sDash reversed.\n\nSo in Fortran, each of these steps needs to be translated.\n\nNow, let's think about how to reverse a string in Fortran. For a string of length L, reversed_string = original_string(L:1:-1). For example, \"abc\" reversed is \"cba\".\n\nSo for S, T = reverse(S) would be S reversed. Similarly, revU is the reverse of (S concatenated with T). So:\n\nT = S(len(S):1:-1)\nrevU = reverse(S // T) \u2192 which is (S // T)(len(S//T):1:-1)\n\nIn Fortran, concatenation is done with // operator. Reversed can be done with (string)(len(string):1:-1).\n\nBut the original S is length N. So when S is reversed, T is also length N. Then S//T is length 2N. Then revU is the reverse of that, which is also length 2N.\n\nSo for revU, in Fortran:\n\nrevU = (S // T)(len(S//T):1:-1)\n\nNow, in the loop for i_java from N down to 0 step step:\n\nFor each i_java, get the substring of revU starting at i_java+1, length N. But we need to ensure that the substring is valid. For example, when i_java is N, then starting position is N+1, and the substring is revU(N+1 : N+1 + N-1) \u2192 revU(N+1 : 2N). Which is correct.\n\nBut if i_java is 0, then starting position is 1, substring is revU(1:N). Which is correct.\n\nNow, comparing strings lexicographically. In Java, sDash.compareTo(tmp) > 0 means tmp is smaller than sDash. So in Fortran, we need to compare the strings lex order. Fortran has the .lt. operator for characters. But comparing two strings can be done as:\n\nif (tmp < sDash) then ... \n\nBut leading and trailing spaces can affect comparison. Since we are dealing with exact substrings, perhaps it's safe. So for example, if sDash is 'abc' and tmp is 'abd', then tmp is larger. So the comparison in Fortran would be (tmp < sDash) returns true if tmp is lex smaller.\n\nSo in the code, if tmp is less than sDash, then update sDash to tmp.\n\nElse, if not firstTime, break the loop.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (tmp < sDash) then\n   sDash = tmp\nelse\n   if (.not. firstTime) then\n       exit\n   endif\nendif\n\nNow, the firstTime condition. After the first iteration, firstTime is set to .false. Also, if firstTime is .true., after processing, if 2^K > N, output the first character of sDash N times.\n\nBut 2^K is computed as 2**K in Fortran. But K is modified during the loop. Wait, in the Java code, when firstTime is true, after processing the loop over i_java, the code checks if Math.pow(2, K) > N. But K is the original K before the decrement? Because in the code, K is being decremented only after this check. Because the code is:\n\nwhile (K >0) {\n\n   ... processing ...\n\n   if (firstTime) {\n      firstTime = false;\n      if (Math.pow(2, K) > N) { ... }\n   }\n\n   K--;\n\n}\n\nSo when checking Math.pow(2, K) > N, it's using the current K (before decrement). Because K is decremented after the check. So in Fortran, during the firstTime check, the current K is the original K before K = K -1.\n\nSo in Fortran, during the first iteration of K (when firstTime is true), K is the original K, not yet decremented. Because the K-- is after the check.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the loop over i_java (the substring processing), if firstTime is true:\n\n   firstTime = .false.\n\n   if (2**K > N) then\n\n       print the first character of sDash, repeated N times.\n\n       stop\n\n   endif\n\nThen, step is increased by doubling it (but only if not firstTime). Wait, in the Java code, after the firstTime check, if firstTime is true, step is not modified (since step is added in the else block). Else, step += step (doubled).\n\nSo in Fortran, after the firstTime block, if firstTime was .true., then step remains 1. Else, step is doubled.\n\nSo, code flow:\n\nif (firstTime) then\n\n   firstTime = .false.\n\n   if (2**K > N) then\n\n       ! output first character of sDash N times\n\n       write(*, '(a)') repeat(sDash(1:1), N)\n\n       stop\n\n   endif\n\nelse\n\n   step = step * 2\n\nendif\n\nThen K is decremented by 1.\n\nNow, the next step is to set S = sDash reversed. So in Fortran:\n\nS = sDash(len(sDash):1:-1)\n\nBut wait, sDash is a substring of revU, which is of length N. So sDash is length N. So reversed sDash is of length N.\n\nPutting this all together.\n\nNow, handling variable declarations. Since Fortran requires variables to be declared with their types. \n\nThe initial variables:\n\ninteger :: N, K, step, i_java\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: S, T, revU, sDash, tmp\nlogical :: firstTime\n\nBut in Fortran, when dealing with dynamic length strings, we need to allocate them. For example, after reading N, we can set the length of S to N.\n\nBut when reading S from input, how to handle the length? For example, in Fortran, if we read a string into a variable, the length is fixed. So when reading S, assuming it's exactly length N. So:\n\nread(*,*) S  ! but this would require S to be declared with length, say, 1000. But not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, read into a buffer of sufficient length, then trim and adjust.\n\nBut in the Java code, the input S is a single token (assuming sc.next()). So perhaps we can read the entire line and take the first N characters.\n\nAlternatively, read the input as a string, possibly with trailing spaces, and then take the first N characters.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nread(*,*) N, K\n\nThen read S:\n\ncharacter(len=200000) :: buffer  ! assuming maximum possible length\n\nread(*, '(a)') buffer\n\nS = trim(buffer)\n\nBut we need to ensure that S is exactly length N. So perhaps:\n\nS = buffer(1:N)\n\nBut what if the input is shorter than N? The Java code's input is supposed to be correct, so we can assume S is length N.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nS = buffer(1:N)\n\nBut to be safe, after reading the buffer, take the first N characters.\n\nSo the code:\n\ninteger :: N, K, step, i_java, i\ncharacter(len=200000) :: buffer\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: S, T, revU, sDash, tmp\nlogical :: firstTime\n\nread(*,*) N, K\nread(*, '(a)') buffer\nS = buffer(1:N)\n\nfirstTime = .true.\nstep = 1\n\ndo while (K > 0)\n\n   ! Generate T as reverse of S\n   T = S(len(S):1:-1)\n\n   ! Generate revU as reverse(S//T)\n   revU = (S // T)(len(S//T):1:-1)\n\n   ! Initialize sDash as S\n   sDash = S\n\n   ! Loop i_java from N down to 0 step step\n   i_java = N\n   do while (i_java >= 0)\n\n       ! Extract substring starting at i_java+1 of length N\n       tmp = revU(i_java+1 : i_java + N)\n\n       if (tmp < sDash) then\n           sDash = tmp\n       else\n           if (.not. firstTime) then\n               exit\n           endif\n       endif\n\n       i_java = i_java - step\n   end do\n\n   if (firstTime) then\n       firstTime = .false.\n\n       if (2**K > N) then\n           ! Print first character of sDash N times\n           write(*, '(a)') repeat(sDash(1:1), N)\n           stop\n       endif\n   else\n       step = step * 2\n   endif\n\n   K = K - 1\n\n   ! S becomes sDash reversed\n   S = sDash(len(sDash):1:-1)\n\nend do\n\n! After loop, output S reversed\nwrite(*, '(a)') S(len(S):1:-1)\n\nNow, let's check some points.\n\n- When revU is created, it's the reverse of S concatenated with T, which is the reverse of S. So S concatenated with T is S followed by reversed S. Then revU is the reverse of that. For example, if S is \"abc\", then T is \"cba\", S//T is \"abccba\", revU is \"abccba\" reversed, which is \"abccba\" again (since it's a palindrome). But for non-palindromic S, this would change.\n\n- The loop over i_java starts at N and steps down by step. For each iteration, tmp is a substring of revU of length N. These substrings are compared to find the lex smallest sDash.\n\n- The firstTime condition handles the case where after the first step, if 2^K is greater than N, which implies that after K steps, the minimal possible string is all the first character of sDash. So output that.\n\n- The step variable is doubled each time after the first iteration.\n\nNow, potential issues:\n\n- Handling of substrings when i_java+1 exceeds the length of revU. But revU is of length 2*N. The loop starts at i_java = N, so i_java+1 is N+1, and i_java+N is N + N = 2*N. So the substring is revU(N+1:2*N), which is valid. For i_java = 0, the substring is revU(1:N), which is valid. So no out-of-bounds.\n\n- The repeat function in Fortran for generating the first character N times. The code uses repeat(sDash(1:1), N). That should work.\n\n- The final output is S reversed. Because in each step, S is set to sDash reversed, and after K steps, the final S is the result of K reversals. Then, the code reverses it again and outputs. \n\nBut let's think about the initial steps. For example, K=1:\n\nInitial S = s0.\n\nAfter processing K=1:\n\nsDash is computed, then S becomes sDash reversed.\n\nThen, after the loop, output S reversed \u2192 which is sDash.\n\nWhich matches the Java code's behavior.\n\nSo yes, the final output is S reversed, which is the same as sDash after the last iteration.\n\nNow, testing the code with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 1\n\nabc\n\nJava code steps:\n\nS = \"abc\"\n\nK=1.\n\nT = reverse(S) = \"cba\".\n\nrevU = reverse(S + T) \u2192 reverse(\"abccba\") = \"abccba\".\n\nLoop i from 3 down to 0 step 1 (since step=1 first time).\n\ni=3: substring starts at 3 (Java indices) \u2192 substring is 3 to 6 (excl), which is \"cba\". revU is \"abccba\", so substring (3,6) is \"cba\". sDash starts as \"abc\". \"cba\" is smaller, so sDash = \"cba\".\n\ni=2: substring starts at 2 \u2192 \"bcc\" \u2192 \"bcc\" compared to \"cba\" \u2192 \"bcc\" is larger, so no change.\n\nBut since firstTime is true, even if not smaller, we don't break.\n\ni=1: substring starts at 1 \u2192 \"abc\" \u2192 same as original sDash, which is now \"cba\". So \"abc\" is larger than \"cba\", so no change. Since firstTime is true, continue.\n\ni=0: substring starts at 0 \u2192 \"abcc\" \u2192 no, wait substring is 0 to 3 (excl) \u2192 \"abc\".\n\nWait, revU is \"abccba\". So in Java:\n\ni=3: substring(3, 6) \u2192 characters 3,4,5 \u2192 'cba'.\n\ni=2: substring(2,5) \u2192 'ccb'?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me re-calculate.\n\nrevU is \"abccba\" (reverse of \"abccba\" since S is \"abc\", T is \"cba\", so S//T is \"abccba\", reversed is \"abccba\".\n\nLoop i from 3 down to 0:\n\ni=3: substring(3, 3+3) \u2192 3 to 6 (excl), which is 'cba'.\n\ni=3-1=2: i=2: substring(2,5) \u2192 'ccb'.\n\nWait, revU is \"abccba\", indexes 0-5.\n\ni=3: substring 3-6 \u2192 indexes 3,4,5 \u2192 'cba'.\n\ni=2: substring 2-5 \u2192 indexes 2,3,4 \u2192 'ccb'.\n\ni=1: substring 1-4 \u2192 'bcc'.\n\ni=0: substring 0-3 \u2192 'abc'.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal substring is 'abc' (i=0) and 'cba' (i=3). But in the loop, since i starts at 3 and steps down, 'cba' is found first. So sDash becomes 'cba'. Then, when i=2, substring is 'ccb', which is larger than 'cba', so no change. Since firstTime is true, the loop continues. At i=0, substring is 'abc' which is larger than 'cba' (since 'cba' < 'abc' is false). So sDash remains 'cba'.\n\nThen, since firstTime is true and 2^K = 2^1 = 2 which is not >3 (N=3), so no output. Then step becomes step*2 = 2. K is decremented to 0. The loop ends. Then, S is 'cba' reversed \u2192 'abc'. The final output is S reversed \u2192 'cba'.\n\nSo the output is 'cba'.\n\nBut according to the code, after K=1, the code would output S reversed, which is 'cba'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother example where 2^K > N:\n\nN=2, K=3.\n\nInput S is 'ba'.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nK=3, firstTime is true.\n\nT is 'ab', revU is reverse('baab') \u2192 'baab' reversed is 'baab' (since 'baab' reversed is 'baab').\n\nLoop i_java from 2 down to 0 step 1.\n\ni=2: substring 3:4 (Fortran) \u2192 'ab' (assuming revU is 'baab', length 4. i_java=2, starts at 3, substring is 3:4 (Fortran) \u2192 'ab'.\n\nsDash starts as 'ba'. 'ab' is smaller \u2192 sDash = 'ab'.\n\nThen i=1: substring starts at 2 \u2192 'aa' (from 'baab' \u2192 positions 2:3 \u2192 'aa').\n\nCompare 'aa' < 'ab' \u2192 yes. sDash becomes 'aa'.\n\ni=0: substring starts at 1 \u2192 'ba' (from 'baab', positions 1:2 \u2192 'ba').\n\nCompare 'ba' < 'aa' \u2192 no. Since firstTime is true, loop continues.\n\nSo sDash is 'aa'.\n\nThen, firstTime is false. Check if 2^3=8>2. Yes. So output 'a' repeated 2 times \u2192 'aa'.\n\nSo the code would output 'aa'.\n\nYes, this is correct.\n\nNow, translating all this to Fortran, considering string allocations and such.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, when you assign a string to a variable, if the target is longer than the source, it is padded with spaces. But in our case, the substrings are exactly of length N. So when extracting tmp from revU, tmp is exactly N characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, if the substring is longer than the available characters, it will pad with spaces. So to prevent that, need to ensure that the substring is within bounds.\n\nBut in our case, revU is length 2*N. The loop i_java runs from N down to 0, so the maximum starting index is N+1 (i_java+1). The substring is N characters, so the end index is N+1 + N-1 = 2N. Which is exactly the length of revU. So no padding occurs.\n\nSo the code should handle this correctly.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when comparing strings with operators like '<', the comparison is done lexicographically, but trailing spaces are considered. However, in our case, all strings are exactly length N, so no trailing spaces. Thus, the comparisons should work correctly.\n\nNow, let's write the Fortran code.\n\nBut Fortran has some limitations, such as not being able to dynamically allocate the length of a string in a loop easily. But in this code, S, T, revU, sDash, tmp are all of length N or 2N.\n\nBut in Fortran, when we assign a string to a variable, it must have the same length, or padded with spaces. So perhaps we should preallocate the variables with the maximum possible length.\n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nS is initialized with length N.\n\nT is S reversed, also length N.\n\nrevU is S concatenated with T, which is length 2N.\n\nsDash is initialized as S (length N).\n\ntmp is a substring of revU (length N).\n\nSo all variables can be declared with lengths N or 2N. But in Fortran, the length is fixed once allocated. So, for example:\n\nWhen S is assigned 'abc', its length is 3. Then T is assigned S reversed, which is also 3. revU is assigned the reverse of S//T, which is 6. sDash is assigned S, which is 3. Then tmp is a substring of revU, which is 3 characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you assign a string of different length to a variable, it is either truncated or padded. So to avoid this, we need to ensure that variables are properly allocated with the correct lengths.\n\nBut in Fortran, we can use deferred-length character variables (allocatable), which adjust their length upon assignment.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: S\n\nS = 'abc'  ! Now S has length 3.\n\nThen, T = S(len(S):1:-1) \u2192 length 3.\n\nrevU = (S//T)(len(S//T):1:-1) \u2192 length 6.\n\nBut when you assign revU, it will have length 6.\n\nsDash = S \u2192 length 3.\n\ntmp = revU(i_java+1:i_java+N) \u2192 which is N characters. So tmp will have length N.\n\nBut if sDash is assigned tmp, which is length N, then sDash will become length N. So initially, sDash is length N. Then, after the loop, when S is assigned sDash reversed (length N), which is correct.\n\nBut in Fortran, if you assign a longer string to a variable, it is padded with spaces. Wait no: for deferred-length variables, when you assign a value, the variable is reallocated to the length of the right-hand side.\n\nSo, for example:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: sDash\n\nsDash = 'abc'  ! length 3.\n\nThen:\n\nsDash = 'abcd'  ! now length 4.\n\nSo, this should work.\n\nBut in the code:\n\nInitially, S is length N. Then, after each iteration, S is assigned sDash reversed, which is length N (since sDash is length N). So S remains length N.\n\nSo the code should handle the dynamic length changes properly.\n\nAnother point: the revU is created as the reverse of S//T, which has length 2N. So when N is large, say 1e5, the revU could be 2e5 characters. But in Fortran, this should be manageable as long as the system has enough memory.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFinal Fortran code:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC037_E\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, K, step, i_java\n    character(len=200000) :: buffer\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: S, T, revU, sDash, tmp\n    logical :: firstTime\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*, *) N, K\n    read(*, '(a)') buffer\n    S = buffer(1:N)\n\n    firstTime = .true.\n    step = 1\n\n    do while (K > 0)\n        ! Generate T as reverse of S\n        T = S(len(S):1:-1)\n\n        ! Generate revU as reverse(S // T)\n        revU = (S // T)(len(S // T):1:-1)\n\n        ! Initialize sDash to S\n        sDash = S\n\n        ! Loop over i_java from N down to 0 step step\n        i_java = N\n        do while (i_java >= 0)\n            ! Extract substring of revU starting at i_java+1, length N\n            tmp = revU(i_java + 1 : i_java + N)\n\n            ! Compare tmp and sDash\n            if (tmp < sDash) then\n                sDash = tmp\n            else\n                if (.not. firstTime) then\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end if\n\n            i_java = i_java - step\n        end do\n\n        ! Check if firstTime\n        if (firstTime) then\n            firstTime = .false.\n            if (2**K > N) then\n                ! Output first character of sDash repeated N times\n                write(*, '(a)') repeat(sDash(1:1), N\n                stop\n            end if\n        else\n            step = step * 2\n        end if\n\n        K = K - 1\n\n        ! Update S to reversed sDash\n        S = sDash(len(sDash):1:-1)\n    end do\n\n    ! Output reversed S\n    write(*, '(a)') S(len(S):1:-1)\n\nend program atcoder_AGC037_E\n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nAfter the firstTime check, if 2**K > N, we call stop, which terminates the program. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nAlso, the variables revU and tmp are of length 2*N and N, respectively. But with deferred-length allocation, this should be handled automatically.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- revU could be very large, but Fortran should handle it as long as memory allows.\n\n- The repeat function may have limitations on very large N, but again, assuming the system allows it.\n\nThus, this Fortran code should correctly translate the Java code."
