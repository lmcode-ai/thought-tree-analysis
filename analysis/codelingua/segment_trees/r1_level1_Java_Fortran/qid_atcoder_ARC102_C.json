    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java code computes combinations (n choose k) using dynamic programming. It initializes a 2D array nchoosek up to 4001x4001. The mod is 998244353. Then, for each test case, it reads k and n, and processes each i from 2 to 2*k. \n\nThe main steps are:\n1. Precompute the combination numbers modulo mod.\n2. For each i, compute pairs and active based on some conditions.\n3. Then calculate a total using a loop over j up to pairs, involving the combination numbers and some modular arithmetic.\n\nNow, Fortran has some differences from Java. Arrays are 1-based by default, but I can adjust that. Also, Fortran uses do loops. Since the original code uses 0-based indices for the combination array, I need to adjust that for Fortran's 1-based. Wait, in Java, the array starts at index 0. So for Fortran, maybe declare the array as (0:4000, 0:4000) to keep the same indices. That might be easier.\n\nSo first, the combination table. In Java, nchoosek[i][j] is computed for i from 0 to 4000. In Fortran, if I define it as (0:4000, 0:4000), that's okay. The first loop in Java initializes the 0th and i-th element of each row i. Then for i from 2 to 4000, fill the rest.\n\nIn Fortran, the loops would need to start from 0. Wait, the Java code initializes for all i in 0 to 4000, setting nchoosek[i][0] and nchoosek[i][i] to 1. Then for i >=2, j from 1 to i-1. So Fortran code for this would be:\n\nInitialize nchoosek(0:4000, 0:4000). Then for i from 0 to 4000, set nchoosek(i,0) = 1 and nchoosek(i,i) = 1. Then for i from 2 to 4000, and j from 1 to i-1, compute nchoosek(i,j) = (nchoosek(i-1,j) + nchoosek(i-1,j-1)) mod mod.\n\nWait, but in Java, the loops start from i=0 for the first part. But when i=0, in the first loop, j=0 is set to 1. But for i=0, the loop runs for j=0, which is okay. Then for the second loop, i starts from 2. So the first loop is for all i, setting the first and last elements. Then, for each i >=2, the inner loop from j=1 to j=i-1.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the combination table:\n\nnchoosek = 0\ndo i = 0, 4000\n    nchoosek(i,0) = 1\n    nchoosek(i,i) = 1\nend do\n\ndo i = 2, 4000\n    do j = 1, i-1\n        nchoosek(i,j) = mod(nchoosek(i-1,j) + nchoosek(i-1,j-1), mod)\n    end do\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the modulo operation is mod(a, p), so that's okay. But need to ensure that the variables are of integer type with sufficient size. Since 998244353 is a prime and the combinations can be large, but since we take mod each time, the numbers should stay within the modulus. So using integer(kind=8) for the variables to handle large numbers.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the variables should be declared as integer(8) to handle large integers, and the mod function would return the correct value.\n\nNext, the input part: Java uses Scanner to read k and n. In Fortran, I can read using read(*,*) k, n.\n\nThen, the main loop: for i from 2 to 2*k. But in Java, the loop is for (int i=2; i <=2*k; i++). So in Fortran, do i=2, 2*k.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop variable is incremented by 1 each time. So if 2*k is, say, 10, then i runs 2,3,...,10. Which matches the Java code.\n\nInside the loop, compute pairs based on i. If i >k, then pairs =k -i/2. Else, pairs = (i-1)/2.\n\nWait, but in Java, i is an integer, so i/2 is integer division. In Fortran, using i/2 would also be integer division. So that's okay.\n\nThen active = k - 2*pairs. Then, if i is even (i%2 ==0), subtract 1 from active.\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nif (i % 2 ==0) active -=1;\n\nSo in Fortran, if (mod(i,2) ==0) then active = active -1.\n\nThen, times2 is initialized to 1. Then loop over j from 0 to pairs:\n\ntimes2 starts as 1, then for each j, choice is times2 * nchoosek(pairs,j) mod mod. Then times2 is multiplied by 2 mod mod.\n\nThen check if active + j -1 is <0. If so, skip. Else, add to total the product of choice and nchoosek(n + active -1, active +j -1). Also, if i is even, add another term: choice * nchoosek(n + active -2, active +j -1).\n\nThen total is modulo mod each time.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ntotal = 0_8\ntimes2 = 1_8\ndo j=0, pairs\n    choice = mod(times2 * nchoosek(pairs, j), mod)\n    times2 = mod(times2 * 2, mod)\n    if (active + j -1 < 0) cycle\n    term1 = nchoosek(n + active -1, active + j -1)\n    total = mod(total + choice * term1, mod)\n    if (mod(i,2) ==0) then\n        term2 = nchoosek(n + active -2, active + j -1)\n        total = mod(total + choice * term2, mod)\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the term for when i is even is added to the total. So in Java:\n\ntotal += choice * nchoosek[n + active -1][active +j -1];\nif (i%2 ==0) {\n    total += choice * nchoosek[n + active -2][active +j -1];\n}\n\nBut in Fortran, when active +j -1 could be negative. So in the Java code, there's a check if (active +j -1 <0) continue; So in Fortran, after computing active +j -1, if it's negative, skip.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nIn Java:\n\nif (active + j -1 <0) continue;\n\nSo the subsequent lines (adding to total) are skipped if active +j-1 is negative.\n\nBut in the code, active is k-2*pairs. Let's see:\n\nWhen i is even, active is adjusted (subtract 1). But during the loop over j, active +j -1 could be negative. So in that case, the code skips the iteration.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each j in 0..pairs, check if (active +j -1) <0. If yes, cycle (skip the rest of the loop body).\n\nWait, but in the code, the check is done after computing choice and times2. So the code first computes choice and updates times2, then checks if active +j-1 is negative. If so, skips the rest. So in Fortran, inside the loop:\n\ndo j=0, pairs\n    choice = mod(...)\n    times2 = ...\n    if (active + j -1 <0) cycle\n    compute term1 and add to total\n    if i even, compute term2 and add\nend do\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the code:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j <= pairs; j++) {\n    long choice = times2 * nchoosek[pairs][j] % mod;\n    times2 = times2 * 2 % mod;\n    if (active + j -1 < 0) continue;\n    total += choice * nchoosek[n + active -1][active + j -1];\n    if (i % 2 == 0) {\n        total += choice * nchoosek[n + active -2][active + j -1];\n    }\n    total %= mod;\n}\n\nSo the choice is computed regardless of the condition, and times2 is updated. So even if active +j-1 is negative, the choice and times2 are calculated. So in Fortran, the code should do the same.\n\nThus, in the Fortran loop, even if active +j-1 is negative, the choice is computed and times2 is updated, but the terms are not added to total.\n\nSo the Fortran loop would be:\n\ndo j=0, pairs\n    choice = mod(times2 * nchoosek(pairs, j), mod)\n    times2 = mod(times2 * 2, mod)\n    temp = active + j -1\n    if (temp <0) cycle\n    term1 = nchoosek(n + active -1, temp)\n    total = mod(total + choice * term1, mod)\n    if (mod(i,2) ==0) then\n        term2 = nchoosek(n + active -2, temp)\n        total = mod(total + choice * term2, mod)\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the term for when i is even is added. The 'active +j -1' is the same for both terms. But in the second term, the first parameter is n + active -2. So for the term2, the first index is n+active-2, and the second is active+j-1.\n\nSo in Fortran, that's:\n\nnchoosek(n + active -2, active +j -1)\n\nBut in the code, active +j-1 could be up to (pairs) + active -1. But since pairs is (i-1)/2 or similar, perhaps it's within the array bounds. But in the combination array, the first dimension is up to 4000, so n + active-1 must be <=4000.\n\nBut the original Java code uses nchoosek up to 4000. So in Fortran, the array is dimensioned from 0 to 4000 in both dimensions, which should be okay.\n\nBut we need to make sure that when n is read from input, n + active -1 and n + active -2 do not exceed 4000. Otherwise, the code would access out of bounds. Wait, in the original Java code, how is the nchoosek array used? For example, in the code:\n\nnchoosek[n + active -1][active + j -1]\n\nIn Java, the array is 4001x4001, indexes from 0 to 4000. So if n+active-1 exceeds 4000, this would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. But in the Java code, is there any check on n and k to ensure that these values are within the allowed range? For example, the code reads k and n from the input, but the combination array is precomputed up to 4000. So if n + active -1 exceeds 4000, the code would crash.\n\nBut the original code does not have any input constraints mentioned. So perhaps in the problem statement, the input values for n and k are such that these indices do not exceed 4000. Therefore, when translating to Fortran, the same assumption is made.\n\nSo the Fortran code will not check for array bounds, but will expect that the input values are within the constraints that n + active -1 <=4000. Otherwise, the code will crash.\n\nSo moving on.\n\nNow, in Fortran, when writing the code, all variables must be declared. Let's think about the variable declarations.\n\nThe variables k, n, i, pairs, active, j, temp are integers. The combination array is a 2D array of integers (mod 998244353). The total and times2 are integers as well.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger(8) :: mod = 998244353\ninteger(8), dimension(0:4000, 0:4000) :: nchoosek\ninteger(8) :: k, n, i, pairs, active, j, temp, times2\ninteger(8) :: total, choice, term1, term2\n\nBut in Fortran, variables declared inside the program need to be properly initialized. Also, the combination array is initialized in the code.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\n1. Precompute the combination table.\n2. Read k and n.\n3. Loop i from 2 to 2*k.\n4. For each i, compute pairs and active.\n5. Compute the total via the inner loop over j.\n6. Print total.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nIn Fortran, the code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: mod = 998244353_8\n    integer(8), dimension(0:4000, 0:4000) :: nchoosek\n    integer(8) :: i, j, k, n, pairs, active, times2, temp, total, choice, term1, term2\n    integer(8) :: ii, jj\n\n    ! Precompute nchoosek\n    do i = 0, 4000\n        nchoosek(i, 0) = 1_8\n        nchoosek(i, i) = 1_8\n    end do\n\n    do i = 2, 4000\n        do j = 1, i-1\n            nchoosek(i, j) = mod(nchoosek(i-1, j) + nchoosek(i-1, j-1), mod)\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) k, n\n\n    ! Process each i from 2 to 2*k\n    do i = 2, 2*k\n        if (i > k) then\n            pairs = k - i / 2\n        else\n            pairs = (i - 1) / 2\n        end if\n\n        active = k - 2 * pairs\n        if (mod(i, 2) == 0) active = active - 1\n\n        times2 = 1_8\n        total = 0_8\n\n        do j = 0, pairs\n            choice = mod(times2 * nchoosek(pairs, j), mod)\n            times2 = mod(times2 * 2_8, mod)\n\n            temp = active + j - 1\n            if (temp < 0) cycle\n\n            term1 = nchoosek(n + active - 1, temp)\n            total = mod(total + choice * term1, mod)\n\n            if (mod(i, 2) == 0) then\n                term2 = nchoosek(n + active - 2, temp)\n                total = mod(total + choice * term2, mod)\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        write(*, '(I0)') total\n    end do\nend program main\n\nBut wait, in the combination array, the first index is nchoosek(n + active -1, temp). In Java, nchoosek is a 2D array where the first index is the 'n' and the second is 'k'. So in Fortran, nchoosek is also (n, k). So the code is correct.\n\nNow, test for possible off-by-one errors. For example, when i is 2, k is given. Let's say in Java, pairs is (i-1)/2. For i=2, (2-1)/2=0.5, which is 0 in integer division. So pairs=0. Then active = k - 0*2 =k. If i is even (mod 2=0), active is k-1.\n\nBut in the code, for example, when i=2 and pairs=0, then in the j loop, j runs from 0 to 0. So j=0. Compute choice as times2 * nchoosek(0,0) = 1*1=1. Then check if active +j -1 >=0. active is k-1 (since i is even). So temp = (k-1) +0 -1 =k-2. If k >=2, then temp >=0. So term1 is nchoosek(n + (k-1) -1, k-2) = nchoosek(n +k-2, k-2) which is the combination of (n+k-2 choose k-2). Then, since i is even, add term2: nchoosek(n +k-2 -1, k-2) = nchoosek(n +k-3, k-2). So total is (term1 + term2) * choice (which is 1).\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Fortran, when using integer division, (i-1)/2 for i even. For example, i=3: (3-1)/2=1. i=4: (4-1)/2=1.5 => 1. But in Java, integer division rounds towards zero, so (3-1)/2 is 1, (4-1)/2 is 1.5 truncated to 1. So same in Fortran.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the variables are declared as integer(8), which is 8-byte integers. The mod is 998244353, which is less than 2^30, so 8-byte integers can handle the mod operations.\n\nNow, testing the code with some input. Let's take a sample input, like k=2, n=1. Then the code would process i from 2 to 4.\n\nBut I'm not sure what the expected output is, but assuming that the Fortran code is a correct translation of the Java code, which is the main goal here.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. Array indexing: Java uses 0-based, Fortran uses 0-based here (since the array is declared from 0 to 4000). So no problem.\n\n2. Modular operations: mod function in Fortran returns a non-negative result. Which matches Java's % operator (but in Java, if the value is negative, % returns a negative remainder. Wait, no. Java's % operator returns a remainder with the same sign as the dividend. So in Java, (a % mod) can be negative if a is negative. But in the code, all the terms are positive, so the sum would be positive, so (a +b) % mod is okay. In Fortran, mod(a, mod) returns a non-negative result. So in cases where a is negative, mod in Fortran returns a different result. But in the code, the variables are computed such that they are positive. Because the code in Java uses (a +b) % mod, which ensures that the sum is non-negative. So in Fortran, using mod after each step is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when you do mod(a, mod), the result is in [0, mod-1]. In Java, the same when a is positive. So the code should work.\n\nThus, the translation should be correct."
