    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. \n\nThe main part is the solve() function. It reads a position value, then finds some index through a loop. The getValueAtIndex function computes 1 + ((index-1)*index/2). Then, the solve function determines the startIndex and outputs (position - startIndex + 1).\n\nSo the steps are: find the largest nrstSeqStartIndx such that getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx) <= position. Then calculate the difference plus one.\n\nFirst, let's think about the loops. The first loop doubles nrstSeqStartIndx until getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx*2) is less than position. Then, it increments nrstSeqStartIndx while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx+1) <= position. This effectively finds the highest index where the value is <= position.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let's start with the getValueAtIndex function. In Java, it's a function that takes a long and returns a long. In Fortran, I'll make it a function as well. The formula is 1 + (index-1)*index/2. Since Fortran uses integer division with /, but here (index-1)*index is even, so dividing by 2 should be okay. \n\nNow, the main program. The Java code uses a Scanner and PrintWriter for input/output. Fortran will read from standard input and write to standard output. The in class with nextLong() is used to read the input. In Fortran, we can just read the input as an integer.\n\nSo, the steps for Fortran:\n\n1. Read the position as an integer. Let's use a 64-bit integer to handle large values, since Java's long is 64-bit. In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) variables.\n\n2. Implement the getValueAtIndex function.\n\n3. Replicate the loop structure to find nrstSeqStartIndx.\n\nLet me outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, the getValueAtIndex function:\n\nfunction getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n    integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: index\n    integer(kind=8) :: res\n    res = 1 + ((index - 1) * index) / 2\nend function\n\nThen, the main program:\n\nprogram codeforces_622_A\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex\n    integer(kind=8) :: getValueAtIndex\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) position\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\n    end do\n\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx + 1\n    end do\n\n    startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n    write(*, '(I0)') (position - startIndex) + 1\n\ncontains\n\n    function getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: index\n        integer(kind=8) :: res\n        res = 1 + ((index - 1) * index) / 2\n    end function\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the do while loops have to have conditions. Also, in the Java code, the first loop checks if getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx*2) is less than position. So in Fortran, the condition is getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position. If yes, multiply by 2 and loop again.\n\nThe second loop increments nrstSeqStartIndx as long as getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position. So the condition is getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position, and inside the loop, we add 1.\n\nWait, no. The Java code says while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++; So as long as the next index's value is <= position, increment. So in Fortran:\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx + 1\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the do while loop checks the condition before each iteration. So if the condition is true, it executes the loop body. So the loop continues as long as the condition is true. That's the same as the Java code. So the translation here is correct.\n\nNow, about the integer types. In Java, the code uses long, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, using integer(kind=8) is appropriate. But sometimes, the kind values can vary between compilers. To be safe, perhaps use iso_fortran_env's int64.\n\nSo including:\n\nuse, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env\n\nand then using integer(int64) for variables.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_622_A\n    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env\n    implicit none\n    integer(int64) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex\n    integer(int64) :: getValueAtIndex\n\n    read(*,*) position\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1_int64\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_int64) < position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_int64\n    end do\n\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1_int64) <= position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx + 1_int64\n    end do\n\n    startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n    write(*, '(I0)') position - startIndex + 1_int64\n\ncontains\n\n    function getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n        integer(int64), intent(in) :: index\n        integer(int64) :: res\n        res = 1_int64 + ((index - 1_int64) * index) / 2_int64\n    end function\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you have expressions with integers, you need to make sure that the operations don't overflow. Since the original Java code uses longs, which can handle large numbers, using int64 in Fortran should be okay.\n\nBut when you multiply (index-1) * index, this could be a very large number. However, in Java, it's allowed to overflow, but in Fortran, if it's out of the integer range, it could cause an error. But since the problem constraints probably don't require numbers larger than 2^63-1, perhaps it's okay. But the original code in Java uses longs, so Fortran's int64 is the right choice.\n\nAnother thing: in the first loop, multiplying by 2 each time. So if position is very large, this loop could be efficient.\n\nTesting the code with some examples.\n\nFor example, if position is 1: the first loop, getValueAtIndex(2) is 1 + (1*2)/2 = 1+1=2. Which is >1. So the loop doesn't execute. Then the second loop checks getValueAtIndex(2) which is 2 <=1? No. So nrstSeqStartIndx remains 1. startIndex is getValue(1) =1. Then position - startIndex +1 is 1-1+1=1.\n\nAnother example: position 3. The getValueAtIndex(1) is 1. getValue(2) is 2, getValue(3) is 4. So first loop: check 2*1=2. getValue(2) is 2. If position is 3, 2 <3. So enter loop, nrst becomes 2. Then check getValue(4) = 1 +3*4/2= 1+6=7. 7 <3? No. So loop ends. Then the second loop: check getValue(3) which is 4 <=3? No. So startIndex is getValue(2)=2. So 3-2+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the Fortran code should read from standard input and write to standard output. So the read statement is read(*,*) position. The write uses '(I0)' to avoid leading spaces.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, the initial value for nrstSeqStartIndx should be 1_int64 to ensure it's treated as int64.\n\nPotential issues: the first loop may have integer overflow if the initial nrstSeqStartIndx*2 becomes too large. But the Java code handles that with long, which Fortran's int64 should as well.\n\nSo the translated code should look like that. Now, check if there's any syntax errors.\n\nWait, in the first line of the program, iso_fortran_env is written as iso_fortran_env, not iso_fortran.\n\nYes.\n\nAlso, in the contains section, the function is inside the program. That's correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nuse iso_fortran_env\n\nprogram codeforces_622_A\n    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env\n    implicit none\n    integer(int64) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex\n\n    read(*,*) position\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1_int64\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_int64) < position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_int64\n    end do\n\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1_int64) <= position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx + 1_int64\n    end do\n\n    startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n    write(*, '(I0)') position - startIndex + 1_int64\n\ncontains\n\n    function getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n        integer(int64), intent(in) :: index\n        integer(int64) :: res\n        res = 1_int64 + ((index - 1_int64) * index) / 2_int64\n    end function getValueAtIndex\n\nend program codeforces_622_A\n\nThat's the correct translation."
