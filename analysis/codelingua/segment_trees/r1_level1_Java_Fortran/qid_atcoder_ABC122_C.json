So in Fortran, the same thing. So for each i from 2 to n:\n\nif ( s(i-1) == 'A' .and. s(i) == 'C' ) then\n    frag(i) = 1\nelse\n    frag(i) = 0\nend if\n\nBut wait, in Java, the loop starts at i=2 and adds 1 to frag[i] if the condition holds. So the frag array starts as all zeros, and after the loop, frag[i] is 1 if the condition holds, else 0. So in Fortran, we can directly assign frag(i) to 1 or 0 based on the condition. Yes, that's correct. Then, the rui array is built. rui[0] is 0. For i from 1 to n:\n\nrui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i]\n\nWait, no. In Java, the loop runs from i=2 to n:\n\nrui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i]\n\nBut in Java, the rui array is initialized to zero. So for i=2, rui[2] = rui[1] (0) + frag[2] (0 or 1). Then for i=3, rui[3] = rui[2] + frag[3], and so on. In Fortran, since the rui array is from 0 to n, and initialized to zero, we can loop from i=1 to n and compute rui(i) as rui(i-1) + frag(i), but wait, in Java, the loop for rui is from i=2 to n. So in Java, for i=2, rui[2] = rui[1] + frag[2]. Then for i=3, rui[3] = rui[2] + frag[3], etc. In Fortran, to replicate this, we can loop from i=2 to n:\n\nrui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i) But in Fortran, the rui array is initialized to zero. So rui(0) is 0, rui(1) is 0. For i=2, rui(2) = rui(1) (0) + frag(2). For i=3, rui(3) = rui(2) + frag(3), etc. So the code in Fortran would be:\n\nrui(0) = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n    rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i)\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop starts at i=2. So rui[1] remains 0. Then, for i=2, rui[i] is rui[i-1] (rui[1] which is 0) plus frag[i]. So in Fortran, if the loop is from i=2 to n:\n\ndo i = 2, n\n    rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i)\nend do But what about the initial values?",

Another point: in the code, the frag array is allocated as n elements, but in the loop from i=2 to n, when i=2, we check s(i-1) which is s(1), which is the first character. So that's correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the code reads integers n and q, then a string which is converted to a char array. Then it reads q pairs of integers into a 2D array called range. \n\nNext, there are two arrays, frag and rui. Frag is initialized to size n+1, same with rui. Then, from i=2 to n, it checks if the previous two characters in the c array are 'A' followed by 'C'. If so, frag[i] is incremented by 1. The rui array is a prefix sum of frag.\n\nFinally, for each query, it calculates rui[right] - rui[left] and prints it.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let's start with variable declarations. \n\nFortran uses static typing, so variables need to be declared with their types. The main variables here are n, q, the character array (string), the range array, frag, and rui.\n\nIn Java, the characters are in an array c. In Fortran, we can read the input string into a character variable and process each character. Since Fortran strings are 1-based, the indices might shift. The original code uses c[i-2] and c[i-1] when i starts at 2. So for i=2, in Java, it's accessing index 0 and 1 (since it's 0-based). In Fortran, if the string is stored as a character array starting at 1, then for i starting from 2, we would check positions i-1 and i. Wait, let's think: Java code's c is 0-based. So for i starting at 2 (loop from 2 to n), the code checks c[i-2] and c[i-1]. For example, when i=2, c[0] and c[1]. So in Fortran, if the string is stored as 1-based, then for i=2, we would check positions 1 and 2. So the loop in Fortran would be from 2 to n, and for each i, check if c(i-1) is 'A' and c(i) is 'C'. Because in Fortran, the first character is at index 1. So when i is 2 in the loop (Java), it's c[0] and c[1]. In Fortran, if we read the string into a variable of length len, then each character is at position 1 to len. So the original c array in Java is 0-based, so to get the same elements in Fortran, the indices would be shifted by +1. So, for Java's c[i-2], in Fortran that would be the (i-2 +1)th character? Wait, perhaps I need to map the indices correctly.\n\nWait, let's think again. The Java code's c array is from sc.next().toCharArray(), which is the input string. For example, if the input string is \"ACGT\", then c[0] is 'A', c[1] is 'C', c[2] is 'G', etc.\n\nIn the loop starting at i=2 (from 2 to n), the code checks c[i-2] and c[i-1]. So for i=2, that's c[0] and c[1]. So in Fortran, the string is stored as a variable, say, str, of length n. So each character is str(1), str(2), ..., str(n). So the equivalent of Java's c[i-2] would be str(i-2 + 1) = str(i-1) in Fortran? Wait, when i is 2 in the Java loop, the indices are 0 and 1. But in Fortran, the first character is at 1. So if the Fortran code's loop runs from i=2 to n, then checking str(i-1) and str(i) would correspond to Java's c[i-2] and c[i-1]. Wait, maybe not. Let's see: in Java, for i=2, c[i-2] is c[0], and c[i-1] is c[1]. In Fortran, if the string is stored in str, then the first character is str(1), which is the same as c[0] in Java. So the Java c[k] is Fortran's str(k+1). So for Java's c[i-2], which is k = i-2, then in Fortran, str(k+1) = str(i-2+1) = str(i-1). Similarly, c[i-1] would be str(i-1+1) = str(i). Wait, no. Wait, the Java code's c array has indices from 0 to n-1. Because the input string is of length n. For example, if n is 5, then the string has 5 characters. So when the Java code reads the input into a char array c of length n. So in Fortran, when we read the string, it's stored as a variable of length n, with indices 1 to n. So Java's c[j] corresponds to Fortran's str(j+1). \n\nSo in the Java loop for i from 2 to n, the code checks c[i-2] and c[i-1]. So i-2 ranges from 0 (when i=2) to n-2 (when i=n). So in Fortran, to get the same characters, we need to check str((i-2)+1) and str((i-1)+1). Wait, that would be str(i-1) and str(i). Because (i-2) in Java's index is j, so j+1 is the Fortran index.\n\nSo for i in 2 to n, check if str(i-1) is 'A' and str(i) is 'C'. Because in Java's code, when i=2, it's checking c[0] and c[1], which are the first two characters. In Fortran, those would be str(1) and str(2), which correspond to i-1=1 and i=2 when i=2.\n\nSo yes, in the Fortran code, for each i from 2 to n, check if str(i-1) is 'A' and str(i) is 'C'. If so, increment frag(i) by 1.\n\nNow, for the frag array. In Java, frag is of size n+1. So in Fortran, we can declare it as an array from 1 to n+1, perhaps. Wait, in Java, frag is initialized as new int[n+1], which has indices from 0 to n. But in the code, frag is accessed starting from index 2. Because the loop starts at i=2. So in Fortran, maybe we can have the frag array from 1 to n, but since the loop is from 2 to n, perhaps declaring it as (n) would suffice. Wait, in Java, frag is size n+1. Let's see: the loop runs from i=2 to n (inclusive). So when n is 5, i goes up to 5. The frag array has size n+1, which is 6, indices 0 to 5. So frag[5] is a valid index. So in Fortran, we need to have frag(2) to frag(n). So the array needs to be from 1 to n. So declare frag as dimension(n) perhaps. Wait, but in Java, frag is of size n+1. So for i up to n, which is allowed. So perhaps in Fortran, the frag array should be from 1 to n+1? Or maybe the code uses i up to n, so in Java, the array is size n+1. So in Fortran, we can dimension(0:n), but in Fortran, array indices can start at 1. Let's see. Let me recheck.\n\nIn Java, the frag array is size n+1, so indices 0 to n. The loop runs from i=2 to n. So for i=2, we set frag[i] (since Java arrays are 0-based, i is 2, but the index is 2. Wait no, Java's array is 0-based. Wait no, Java's array is created as new int[n+1], which has indices from 0 to n. So when the code does frag[i]++, for i in 2 to n, that's indices 2 to n. So in Fortran, to have the same indices, the array should be from 1 to n. Because in Fortran, array indices can start at 1, which is more natural. So, for i in 2 to n, frag(i) would correspond to Java's frag[i]. So in Fortran, the frag array can be dimension(n) with indices from 1 to n.\n\nBut in Java, frag is of size n+1. Wait, when n is 5, the array is size 6 (indices 0-5). The loop runs from i=2 to i=5 (since n is 5). So in Java, the code accesses frag[2], frag[3], up to frag[5]. So in Fortran, if the array is declared as frag(n), indices 1 to n, then for n=5, frag has 5 elements. So when i=5, that's allowed. So maybe in Fortran, the array should be from 1 to n, same as Java's indices from 1 to n. But wait, Java's array is 0-based. So when the loop starts at i=2, which is the third element (index 2) in Java's array. Hmm, perhaps there's confusion here.\n\nWait, the Java code has a loop for (i = 2; i <= n; i++). So i runs from 2 to n inclusive. For each i, frag[i]++. So in Java, the frag array is of size n+1 (since it's initialized as new int[n+1]). So the valid indices are 0 to n. So for i=2, the index is 2. So in Fortran, we need to have an array that can hold indices from 2 to n. So declaring frag as (n) and starting from 1 would work, because in Fortran, for i=2, it's frag(2), which is the second element. So the array would be of size n, with indices 1..n. That's acceptable.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nIn Java, frag[i]++ when i starts at 2. So in Fortran, frag(i) = frag(i) + 1.\n\nNow, the rui array is a prefix sum. In Java, rui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i]. So for each i from 2 to n, rui is built. The Java code initializes rui as an array of size n+1. So in Fortran, rui can be dimension(n) as well, starting from 1. But again, in Java, rui is size n+1. For example, for n=5, rui has 6 elements. The loop runs from i=2 to 5, and rui[5] = rui[4] + frag[5]. So in Fortran, if we have rui as (0:n), then for i=2 to n, rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i). But how is rui initialized?\n\nIn Java, rui is initialized to all zeros. Then, for i from 2 to n:\n\nrui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i]\n\nSo in Fortran, the rui array needs to start from 1, but perhaps the initial index is 0. Wait, maybe in Fortran, the rui array can be dimension(0:n). Because for i=1, rui(1) = rui(0) + frag(1). But in Java, when i=2, rui[2] = rui[1] + frag[2]. So in Fortran, if rui is dimensioned from 0 to n, then for i=2 in Java, we have i=2 in Fortran, and rui(2) = rui(1) + frag(2). That would be correct.\n\nWait, maybe in Fortran, the rui array should be from 0 to n. Because in Java, rui[0] is part of the array but is not used. Because the loop starts at i=2. So in Java, rui[i] is computed starting at i=2, which depends on rui[i-1]. For i=2, rui[2] = rui[1] + frag[2]. But rui[1] was initialized to 0, as per Java's array initialization.\n\nSo in Fortran, to have rui(0) as the initial zero, then for i=2 to n, rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i). So the rui array in Fortran would need to have indices from 0 to n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Declare frag as an array from 1 to n, initialized to zero.\n\n- Declare rui as an array from 0 to n, initialized to zero.\n\nIn Fortran, variables are not automatically initialized, so we need to set them to zero.\n\nNow, for reading the input.\n\nIn Java, the code reads n and q, then a string, then q pairs of integers.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read the input using read statements.\n\nFirst, read n and q:\n\nread(*,*) n, q\n\nThen, read the string. The string has length n. So in Fortran, we can read a character variable of length n.\n\ncharacter(n) :: str\n\nread(*,*) str\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read a string with read(*,*), it will read until a whitespace, but maybe the input has leading or trailing spaces. Alternatively, perhaps the input is given as a single line with the string. So the code may need to read the string properly. Alternatively, use a format to read the entire line.\n\nBut let's proceed. So after reading n and q, read the string. So:\n\ncharacter(n) :: s\nread(*,*) s\n\nThen, read q pairs of integers. Each pair is stored in range[i][0] and range[i][1]. In Java, the range array is a 2D array of size q x 2.\n\nIn Fortran, we can have a 2D array of size (q,2), but Fortran is column-major, so perhaps we can store it as (2,q) if needed, but for simplicity, perhaps (q,2).\n\nBut how to read q pairs of integers. For each query, read two integers.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(q,2) :: range\ndo i = 1, q\n    read(*,*) range(i,1), range(i,2)\nend do\n\nBut in Java, range[i][0] and range[i][1] correspond to left and right. So in Fortran, range(i,1) is the first element (left), range(i,2) is the second (right).\n\nNow, processing the frag and rui arrays.\n\nInitialize frag to zero.\n\ninteger, dimension(n) :: frag = 0\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can't initialize arrays that way in declaration unless they are parameters. So perhaps we need to use a loop to initialize.\n\ninteger :: frag(n), rui(0:n)\n\nfrag = 0\nrui = 0\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can assign arrays with = 0 if they are of integer type.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nFirst, frag is of size n (indices 1..n), initialized to 0.\n\nThen, loop from i=2 to n:\n\ndo i=2, n\n    if (s(i-1:i) == 'AC') then\n        frag(i) = frag(i) + 1\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, because in Fortran, the characters are stored as a string s of length n. So for each i from 2 to n, check s(i-1) and s(i). Because in Java's code, for i=2, we check c[0] and c[1], which are s(1) and s(2) in Fortran.\n\nWait, in the original code, for i in 2..n in Java:\n\nif (c[i-2] == 'A' && c[i-1] == 'C') then frag[i]++.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i (Java's i) in 2..n:\n\nthe Java code checks c[i-2] and c[i-1], which are positions i-2 and i-1 in Java's array. But in Fortran, those correspond to s(i-2+1) and s(i-1 +1) ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nJava's c array is 0-based. So for i=2 in Java (the loop variable), c[i-2] is c[0], c[i-1] is c[1].\n\nIn Fortran, the string s is 1-based. So the first character is s(1), second s(2), etc. So c[0] is s(1), c[1] is s(2), etc. So when i=2 in Java's loop, the code checks c[0] and c[1], which are s(1) and s(2) in Fortran. So the condition in Fortran would be s(i-1) == 'A' and s(i) == 'C' ?\n\nBecause in Java's loop, when i=2, we check c[0] (s(1)) and c[1] (s(2)), which are positions i-1 and i in Fortran's loop. So for Fortran's loop from i=2 to n, the code checks s(i-1) and s(i). So in Fortran:\n\nif ( s(i-1) == 'A' .and. s(i) == 'C' ) then\n\nSo for i starting at 2 up to n:\n\ndo i = 2, n\n    if ( s(i-1:i) == 'AC' ) then\n        frag(i) = 1\n    else\n        frag(i) = 0\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, no. Because in Java, for each i, if the condition is met, frag[i] is incremented by 1. So frag[i] is 1 if 'AC' is found at positions i-2 and i-1 in Java's code, which in Fortran would be positions i-1 and i. So in Fortran, for each i from 2 to n, if s(i-1) is 'A' and s(i) is 'C', then frag(i) = 1. Otherwise, 0. Because initially, frag is all zero. So in Fortran, the loop would set frag(i) to 1 in that case.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, frag[i] is initially 0 (since the array is initialized to zero), and for each i, if the condition holds, it increments by 1. So in Fortran, the same thing. So for each i from 2 to n:\n\nif ( s(i-1) == 'A' .and. s(i) == 'C' ) then\n    frag(i) = 1\nelse\n    frag(i) = 0\nend if\n\nBut wait, in Java, the loop starts at i=2 and adds 1 to frag[i] if the condition holds. So the frag array starts as all zeros, and after the loop, frag[i] is 1 if the condition holds, else 0. So in Fortran, we can directly assign frag(i) to 1 or 0 based on the condition.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the rui array is built. rui[0] is 0. For i from 1 to n:\n\nrui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i]\n\nWait, no. In Java, the loop runs from i=2 to n:\n\nrui[i] = rui[i-1] + frag[i]\n\nBut in Java, the rui array is initialized to zero. So for i=2, rui[2] = rui[1] (0) + frag[2] (0 or 1). Then for i=3, rui[3] = rui[2] + frag[3], and so on.\n\nIn Fortran, since the rui array is from 0 to n, and initialized to zero, we can loop from i=1 to n and compute rui(i) as rui(i-1) + frag(i), but wait, in Java, the loop for rui is from i=2 to n. So in Java, for i=2, rui[2] = rui[1] + frag[2]. Then for i=3, rui[3] = rui[2] + frag[3], etc.\n\nIn Fortran, to replicate this, we can loop from i=2 to n:\n\nrui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i)\n\nBut in Fortran, the rui array is initialized to zero. So rui(0) is 0, rui(1) is 0. For i=2, rui(2) = rui(1) (0) + frag(2). For i=3, rui(3) = rui(2) + frag(3), etc.\n\nSo the code in Fortran would be:\n\nrui(0) = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n    rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i)\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop starts at i=2. So rui[1] remains 0. Then, for i=2, rui[i] is rui[i-1] (rui[1] which is 0) plus frag[i]. So in Fortran, if the loop is from i=2 to n:\n\ndo i = 2, n\n    rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i)\nend do\n\nBut what about the initial values? Since rui is initialized to 0, then rui(0) = 0, rui(1) = 0. Then, for i=2, rui(2) = rui(1) (0) + frag(2). For i=3, rui(3) = rui(2) + frag(3), etc. So yes, this is correct.\n\nBut in Java, the code for rui starts at i=2 and runs up to n. So the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nSo the code for building rui is:\n\nrui(0) = 0\nrui(1) = 0\ndo i = 2, n\n    rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i)\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, if rui is initialized to zero, then rui(0) and rui(1) are already zero. Then, the loop for i=2 to n would compute rui(i) correctly.\n\nBut in the Java code, for i=2, the loop starts. So in Fortran, the loop should start at i=2. So yes.\n\nThen, for each query, left and right are the input numbers. For each query, the output is rui[right] - rui[left].\n\nBut in Java, the output is rui[right] - rui[left]. For example, if the query is (left, right), then the answer is rui[right] - rui[left].\n\nIn Fortran, since rui is 0-based, for a query with left and right (which are 1-based?), we need to check. The original code in Java reads the input as range[i][0] and range[i][1], which are left and right. For example, if the input is 2 3, then the code subtracts rui[3] - rui[2].\n\nSo in Fortran, for a query with left and right, the result is rui(right) - rui(left).\n\nSo in the output phase:\n\ndo i = 1, q\n    left = range(i, 1)\n    right = range(i, 2)\n    print *, rui(right) - rui(left)\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Java, the left and right are the input integers. For example, the code reads them as range[i][0] and range[i][1], which are stored as left and right. Then, the code computes rui[right] - rui[left].\n\nSo in Fortran, the same applies. So for each query, take left and right from the range array, then subtract rui(left) from rui(right).\n\nBut in Java, the rui array is of size n+1, so if right is up to n, which is allowed. In Fortran, rui is 0:n, so right can be up to n.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, let's put this all together.\n\nFirst, variable declarations:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC122_C\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, q, i, left, right\n    character(:), allocatable :: s\n    integer, allocatable :: frag(:), rui(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: range(:,:)\n    \n    read(*,*) n, q\n    allocate(character(n) :: s)\n    read(*,'(A)') s\n    allocate(range(q,2))\n    do i = 1, q\n        read(*,*) range(i,1), range(i,2)\n    end do\n    \n    allocate(frag(n))  ! frag(1..n)\n    frag = 0\n    do i = 2, n\n        if (s(i-1:i) == 'AC') then\n            frag(i) = 1\n        else\n            frag(i) = 0\n        end if\n    end do\n    \n    allocate(rui(0:n))\n    rui = 0\n    do i = 2, n\n        rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i)\n    end do\n    \n    do i = 1, q\n        left = range(i,1)\n        right = range(i,2)\n        print *, rui(right) - rui(left)\n    end do\nend program atcoder_ABC122_C\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read a string into a variable, if the length is fixed, perhaps using a fixed-length character variable. So when reading the string, if the user inputs a string of length n, then the code reads it properly. However, in Fortran, when you read a string with '(A)', it reads the entire line, including leading and trailing spaces. So for example, if the input string is after n and q, perhaps the code needs to read the string correctly.\n\nBut assuming that the input is given correctly, then this should work.\n\nAnother point: in the code, the frag array is allocated as n elements, but in the loop from i=2 to n, when i=2, we check s(i-1) which is s(1), which is the first character. So that's correct.\n\nBut in Fortran, the frag array is 1-based. So frag(2) is the second element. The loop starts at i=2, which is correct.\n\nNow, for the rui array: allocated as 0:n. Then, in the loop from i=2 to n, rui(i) = rui(i-1) + frag(i). So for i=2, rui(2) = rui(1) + frag(2). But rui(1) is initialized to 0. So yes.\n\nBut wait, in the code after allocating rui, it's initialized to 0. Then, the loop starts at i=2. So rui(0) is 0, rui(1) is 0. For i=2, rui(2) = rui(1) (0) + frag(2) (0 or 1). Then for i=3, rui(3) = rui(2) + frag(3), etc.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting this code with sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n8 3\nACACTACG\n3 7\n2 3\n1 8\n\nIn Java, the code would compute the frag array as follows:\n\nThe string is \"ACACTACG\".\n\nIndices in Java's c array (0-based):\n\n0: A\n1: C\n2: A\n3: C\n4: T\n5: A\n6: C\n7: G\n\nThe loop for i from 2 to 8 (since n=8):\n\nFor i=2: check c[0] (A) and c[1] (C) \u2192 AC \u2192 frag[2] = 1.\n\ni=3: check c[1] (C) and c[2] (A) \u2192 no \u2192 frag[3] = 0.\n\ni=4: check c[2] (A) and c[3] (C) \u2192 AC \u2192 frag[4] =1.\n\ni=5: c[3] (C) and c[4] (T) \u2192 no.\n\ni=6: c[4] (T) and c[5] (A) \u2192 no.\n\ni=7: c[5] (A) and c[6] (C) \u2192 AC \u2192 frag[7] =1.\n\ni=8: c[6] (C) and c[7] (G) \u2192 no \u2192 frag[8] =0.\n\nSo the frag array (Java's indices 0-8):\n\nfrag[0] = 0 (unused)\n\nfrag[1] =0 (unused)\n\nfrag[2] =1\n\nfrag[3] =0\n\nfrag[4] =1\n\nfrag[5] =0\n\nfrag[6] =0\n\nfrag[7] =1\n\nfrag[8] =0\n\nThe rui array (Java) is:\n\nrui[0] =0\n\nrui[1] =0\n\nrui[2] =1\n\nrui[3] =1 (rui[2] + frag[3] \u2192 1+0=1)\n\nrui[4] =1+1=2\n\nrui[5] =2+0=2\n\nrui[6] =2+0=2\n\nrui[7] =2+1=3\n\nrui[8] =3+0=3.\n\nSo for queries:\n\n3 7 \u2192 rui[7] - rui[3] \u21923-1=2.\n\nIn the sample input, the first query is 3 7. The answer is 2.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the same input, the code should output 2.\n\nIn Fortran, the frag array would be:\n\nfrag(2) =1\n\nfrag(4) =1\n\nfrag(7) =1.\n\nThen, rui(0) =0, rui(1)=0, rui(2)=1, rui(3)=1 (rui(2) + frag(3) \u2192 1 +0), rui(4)=2, etc.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, checking the code for potential issues.\n\nThe reading of the string: in Fortran, when you allocate a character variable of length n and read it with read(*,'(A)'), it may read the entire line, including trailing spaces. But if the input string is exactly of length n, then it's fine. Otherwise, if there are trailing spaces, the code may read more characters. For example, if the input line is \"ACACTACG \" (with a space after G), then the code would read n characters (assuming n=8), which would be \"ACACTACG\".\n\nAlternatively, use read(*,*) s. But when using list-directed input (read(*,*) s), the string is read up to a space or newline. So if the input string is followed by other data, this could cause issues.\n\nSo perhaps the code should read the entire line as the string.\n\nIn the Java code, sc.next() reads the next token, which is the string. So it is not line-based. So if the input string is split across lines, it would still read. But in practice, the string is given as a single line.\n\nSo in Fortran, to read the string properly, perhaps using read(*,'(a)') s. But if s is allocated with length n, then reading with '(a)' would read the entire line, which may have more than n characters. So perhaps the code should read the first n characters.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line and then take the first n characters.\n\nSo for example:\n\ncharacter(100000) :: tmp\nread(*,'(a)') tmp\ns = tmp(1:n)\n\nBut Fortran requires that s be of length n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should read the string using a format that reads exactly n characters.\n\nBut in practice, the code should read the next n characters, which is the input string.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nread(*,*) n, q\nallocate(character(n) :: s)\nread(*,'(a)') s\n\nBut if the user inputs a string with leading or trailing spaces, this would be captured. So the code may need to read the next line, and take the first n characters.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nread(*,*) s\n\nBut list-directed input skips leading spaces and reads until a space or newline. So if the string is followed by other data, this could be a problem. But in the problem's input, the string is a single token, so read(*,*) s would work.\n\nBut the Java code uses sc.next(), which reads the next token. So using read(*,*) s in Fortran is appropriate.\n\nSo changing the code to read:\n\nread(*,*) n, q\nallocate(character(n) :: s)\nread(*,*) s\n\nThis way, s is read as the next token, which is the string of length n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, when you have a loop variable i, it's implicitly integer. So declaring i as integer is needed.\n\nIn the code, variables are declared:\n\ninteger :: n, q, i, left, right\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, testing for a sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n8 3\nACACTACG\n3 7\n2 3\n1 8\n\nThe code should process the string as \"ACACTACG\", which is 8 characters.\n\nThe frag array for i=2 to 8:\n\ni=2: s(1) = 'A', s(2) = 'C' \u2192 frag(2)=1.\n\ni=3: s(2)='C', s(3)='A' \u2192 no \u2192 frag(3)=0.\n\ni=4: s(3)='A', s(4)='C' \u2192 frag(4)=1.\n\ni=5: s(4)='C', s(5)='T' \u2192 no \u2192 frag(5)=0.\n\ni=6: s(5)='T', s(6)='A' \u2192 no \u2192 frag(6)=0.\n\ni=7: s(6)='A', s(7)='C' \u2192 frag(7)=1.\n\ni=8: s(7)='C', s(8)='G' \u2192 no \u2192 frag(8)=0.\n\nrui array:\n\nrui(0) =0\n\nrui(1) =0\n\nrui(2)=1\n\nrui(3)=1+0=1.\n\nrui(4)=1+1=2.\n\nrui(5)=2+0=2.\n\nrui(6)=2+0=2.\n\nrui(7)=2+1=3.\n\nrui(8)=3+0=3.\n\nSo queries:\n\n3 7 \u2192 rui(7) - rui(3) \u21923-1=2.\n\n2 3 \u2192 rui(3) - rui(2) \u21921-1=0.\n\n1 8 \u2192 rui(8) - rui(1) \u21923-0=3.\n\nSo the outputs would be 2, 0, 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work."
