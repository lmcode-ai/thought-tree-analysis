Then check if pqmin.size (3) < pqmax.size (4). Yes. Move one from pqmax to pqmin. Now sizes are 4 and 3. Then the first condition is 4>3, but we don't check again. So this seems like a loop.

But in the Java code, sum_b is a long. So in Fortran, sum_b should be of type integer(kind=8), as well as sum_min and sum_max. So changing the variables:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: sum_b, sum_min, sum_max, ans, ans1, a, b\n\nBut when reading from parts(2) and (3), they can be large numbers. So in Fortran, use integer(kind=8) variables. So adjusting variable declarations:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: sum_b = 0, sum_min = 0, sum_max = 0, ans, ans1, a, b\n\nBut in the code, when inserting into the heaps, a and the elements are integers.",

Now size_min=1, size_max=0. sum_min=5, sum_max=0.\n\nmin_val = pqmin(1) =5. So correct. So the code should handle this correctly. But in Fortran, during the first iteration, after processing the '1' query, the code sets min_val to pqmin(1), which is valid. So the code should work. Potential issues:\n\n1.",

So in Fortran, a loop from 1 to t. Now, for each '1' query:\n\nParse a and b.\n\nsum_b = sum_b + b\n\nif (a > min) then\n    call insert_max_heap(a)\n    sum_max = sum_max + a\nelse\n    call insert_min_heap(a)\n    sum_min = sum_min + a\nend if\n\nThen check if size_min > size_max:\n\nif (size_min > size_max) then\n    val = extract_min_heap()\n    call insert_max_heap(val)\n    sum_max = sum_max + val\n    sum_min = sum_min - val\nend if\n\nThen check if size_max > size_min:\n\nif (size_max > size_min) then\n    val = extract_max_heap()\n    call insert_min_heap(val)\n    sum_min = sum_min + val\n    sum_max = sum_max - val\nend if\n\nThen, set min to the top of pqmin (if size_min >0)\n\nBut need to handle the case where the heaps are empty.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe code seems to handle a dynamic set of numbers and some queries. There are two priority queues: pqmax is a max-heap and pqmin is a min-heap. Wait, actually, looking at the Java code, pqmax is a PriorityQueue with a custom comparator that orders elements in reverse, so it's a max-heap. pqmin is a normal priority queue, which is a min-heap. The code maintains these two heaps such that the sizes are balanced, and min is always the top of pqmin. When a query of type '2' comes in, it calculates some sum based on the current min and the elements in the heaps. For '1' queries, it adds a new element to the appropriate heap and rebalances if necessary.\n\nSo the main challenge here is translating Java's PriorityQueue into Fortran, which doesn't have built-in priority queues. Fortran has to implement heaps manually. Also, handling the dynamic resizing and maintaining the heap properties will be important.\n\nFirst, let's think about data structures. In Fortran, I can use arrays to represent the heaps. For the max-heap (pqmax) and the min-heap (pqmin), each will need their own array, along with their current size. Also, I'll need to track the sumMin, sumMax, sumb, and min variables.\n\nWait, the Java code uses sumMin and sumMax to track the sum of elements in pqmin and pqmax respectively. So in Fortran, I'll need variables sum_min, sum_max, sum_b. And the min variable holds the current minimum, which is the top of pqmin.\n\nNext, the heaps. For a max-heap, the parent nodes are larger than children, and for a min-heap, the parent nodes are smaller. Implementing insertion and extraction for both types will be needed.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the number of queries t.\n2. For each query:\n   a. If the query is of type '2', output the current min and the computed sum.\n   b. If the query is of type '1', add the new element to the appropriate heap, rebalance the heaps, and update sums and min.\n\nThe tricky parts are implementing the heap operations (insert, extract, maintain heap property) for both max and min heaps.\n\nLet's start by defining the heaps. Let's say we have two arrays for each heap. For example, pqmin_array and pqmax_array. Also, variables to track their sizes, like size_min and size_max.\n\nFor a min-heap, insertion adds an element to the end and bubbles up. Similarly for a max-heap, but comparing in reverse.\n\nIn Fortran, we can create subroutines for each heap operation. For example, insert_min_heap, extract_min_heap, insert_max_heap, extract_max_heap. Each would manage the respective array and size.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, when inserting into the heaps, the code checks if the new element is greater than min. If it is, it goes to pqmax (max-heap), else to pqmin (min-heap). Then after insertion, it checks the sizes. The heaps should be balanced such that their sizes differ by at most one. If pqmin is larger, move the top to pqmax, and vice versa. So after each insertion, we need to check the sizes and rebalance.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the '1' case:\n\n- Parse the input values a and b (s[1] and s[2] in Java, but in Fortran, we'll read them as integers).\n- sumb += b (sum_b in Fortran)\n- If a > min, add to pqmax (max-heap). sum_max += a.\n- Else, add to pqmin (min-heap). sum_min += a.\n- Then, check if the size of pqmin is larger than pqmax. If so, extract the top of pqmin (which is min), add it to pqmax, and adjust sums.\n- Then check if pqmax is larger than pqmin. If so, extract the top of pqmax (which is the max in pqmax), add it to pqmin, adjust sums.\n- The new min is the top of pqmin.\n\nSo the key is maintaining the heaps and their sums correctly.\n\nImplementing the heap operations:\n\nFor the min-heap (pqmin):\n\n- Insert: add element to the end, then bubble up (compare with parent, swap if smaller).\n- Extract the top (min element): swap with last element, remove last, then bubble down (compare with children, swap with smallest child, etc.).\n\nFor the max-heap (pqmax):\n\n- Insert: add element to the end, bubble up (compare with parent, swap if larger).\n- Extract the top (max element): swap with last, remove last, then bubble down (swap with largest child).\n\nEach heap needs its own array and size variable. Let's say for the min-heap, we have pqmin_array with size size_min. For the max-heap, pqmax_array with size size_max.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are fixed size unless using allocatable arrays. So perhaps we can preallocate a large enough array to handle possible elements. Let's assume the maximum number of queries is up to 1e5 or similar. The initial code reads 't' as the number of queries, but in each query, '1' adds one element. So the maximum possible elements is t. So perhaps we can allocate arrays of size t.\n\nAlternatively, use dynamic arrays with reallocatable. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, since each heap can't have more than t elements, we can preallocate arrays of size t.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: pqmin(:), pqmax(:)\ninteger :: size_min = 0, size_max = 0\nallocate(pqmin(t), pqmax(t)) \n\nWait, but in Fortran, the initial allocation size can't be known if t is read from input. So we need to read t first, then allocate the arrays. But in the code, the first line is reading t. So perhaps the order is:\n\nRead t from input.\n\nAllocate pqmin and pqmax with size t.\n\nBut perhaps better to use a reasonable maximum size. Alternatively, the code may have a problem if the number of elements exceeds t. Wait, in the Java code, each '1' query adds one element. So after t queries, there are up to t elements. So if the initial t is read correctly, the arrays can be allocated with size t.\n\nSo first, read t, then allocate the arrays.\n\nBut how to handle dynamic insertion? Let's proceed.\n\nNow, let's outline the Fortran code structure.\n\nFirst, read t:\n\nread(*,*) t\n\nThen, allocate the heaps. Let's say:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: pqmin(:), pqmax(:)\ninteger :: size_min = 0, size_max = 0\nallocate(pqmin(t), pqmax(t)) \n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the array indices start at 1 by default. So when inserting, perhaps using 1-based indexing.\n\nNow, for each query, loop t times:\n\ndo i = 1, t\n    read the line, split into parts\n    if the first part is '2', then compute and output\n    else, process the '1' query\nend do\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop is 'while (t-- > 0)', so exactly t iterations.\n\nSo in Fortran, a loop from 1 to t.\n\nNow, for each '1' query:\n\nParse a and b.\n\nsum_b = sum_b + b\n\nif (a > min) then\n    call insert_max_heap(a)\n    sum_max = sum_max + a\nelse\n    call insert_min_heap(a)\n    sum_min = sum_min + a\nend if\n\nThen check if size_min > size_max:\n\nif (size_min > size_max) then\n    val = extract_min_heap()\n    call insert_max_heap(val)\n    sum_max = sum_max + val\n    sum_min = sum_min - val\nend if\n\nThen check if size_max > size_min:\n\nif (size_max > size_min) then\n    val = extract_max_heap()\n    call insert_min_heap(val)\n    sum_min = sum_min + val\n    sum_max = sum_max - val\nend if\n\nThen, set min to the top of pqmin (if size_min >0)\n\nBut need to handle the case where the heaps are empty. Wait, in the Java code, after inserting elements, the code rebalances, so after processing each '1' query, the heaps are balanced, and their sizes differ by at most 1. So the min is always the top of pqmin.\n\nSo in Fortran, after rebalancing, min = pqmin(1) (if size_min >0). But in code, after inserting and rebalancing, the sizes are adjusted, and pqmin is at least size_max. Wait, the code's rebalancing steps: after inserting, if pqmin's size is larger than pqmax, move one element from pqmin to pqmax. Then, if pqmax's size is larger than pqmin's, move one element from pqmax to pqmin. So after processing, the sizes can only differ by at most 1.\n\nBut the Java code's rebalancing steps:\n\nAfter inserting into one of the heaps, it checks:\n\nif (pqmin.size() > pqmax.size()) {\n    move top of pqmin to pqmax.\n}\n\nThen, if (pqmin.size() < pqmax.size()) {\n    move top of pqmax to pqmin.\n}\n\nWait, after moving from pqmin to pqmax, pqmax's size increases by one, pqmin's decreases by one. Then, the second check is whether pqmin's size is less than pqmax's. For example, if pqmin was larger by 2, after moving one, they become equal. So the second condition would not trigger.\n\nWait, let's think: after inserting into either heap, the code first checks if pqmin.size > pqmax.size. If yes, move one element from pqmin to pqmax.\n\nThen, it checks if pqmin.size < pqmax.size. If yes, move one from pqmax to pqmin.\n\nSo the code ensures that after these steps, the sizes differ by at most one. For example:\n\nSuppose after insertion, pqmin has size 3, pqmax has size 1. Then the first condition is true (3 > 1), move one from pqmin to pqmax. Now sizes are 2 and 2. Then check second condition: pqmin.size (2) is not less than pqmax.size (2), so nothing.\n\nAnother case: after insertion, pqmax has size 3, pqmin has size 2. Then first condition (pqmin.size=2 > pqmax.size=3? No). So move to second condition: pqmin.size (2) < pqmax.size (3). So move one element from pqmax to pqmin. Now sizes are 3 and 2. Then, after that, check again if pqmin.size > pqmax.size (3>2?), which would trigger the first condition again? Wait, no, because the code first checks pqmin.size > pqmax.size, and after moving one from pqmax to pqmin, the new sizes are pqmax.size-1 (2) and pqmin.size+1 (3). Then the first condition would again be true, causing another move. But according to the code, after each insertion, these steps are only done once. Wait, the code as written does these steps once each. So perhaps the code is not handling all cases, but in practice, after the first move, the second condition may require another move.\n\nWait, let's look at the Java code again:\n\nif (pqmin.size() > pqmax.size()) {\n    sumMax += pqmin.peek();\n    sumMin -= pqmin.peek();\n    pqmax.add(pqmin.poll());\n}\nif (pqmin.size() < pqmax.size()) {\n    sumMax -= pqmax.peek();\n    sumMin += pqmax.peek();\n    pqmin.add(pqmax.poll());\n}\n\nWait, so after the first if block (moving from pqmin to pqmax), then the second if block checks if pqmin.size < pqmax.size. For example:\n\nAfter first block, pqmin.size is 2, pqmax is 3. Then, second block checks if 2 <3, which is true. So move from pqmax to pqmin. Now pqmax is 2, pqmin is 3. Then the first block is not checked again. So after these two steps, the sizes could still be unequal. Wait, but perhaps the code is designed to balance the heaps so that pqmin.size is >= pqmax.size. Because after insertion, the code first checks if pqmin is larger than pqmax. If so, move one element to pqmax. Then, check if pqmin is smaller than pqmax. If so, move one element back. The net effect is that after these two steps, the sizes could be equal or pqmin is one larger than pqmax. Let's see:\n\nCase 1: Initial sizes after insertion: pqmin=4, pqmax=3. Then first condition (4>3) is true. Move one from pqmin to pqmax. Now sizes are 3 and 4. Then check if pqmin.size (3) < pqmax.size (4). Yes. Move one from pqmax to pqmin. Now sizes are 4 and 3. Then the first condition is 4>3, but we don't check again. So this seems like a loop.\n\nBut according to the code, these two checks are only done once. So perhaps the code is flawed? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is ensuring that after insertion, the heaps are balanced such that pqmin.size is either equal to pqmax.size or one more. Because the code first moves from pqmin to pqmax if pqmin is larger. Then, if pqmax is larger, moves one to pqmin. So after the two steps, pqmin.size is either equal or one more than pqmax.size.\n\nLet me test with examples:\n\nCase 1: after insertion, pqmin has size 5, pqmax has size 3. \n\nFirst step: pqmin.size > pqmax.size (5>3). Move one from pqmin to pqmax. Sizes become 4 and 4. Then check if pqmin < pqmax (4<4? No). So the code stops. So now sizes are equal.\n\nCase 2: after insertion, pqmax is 4, pqmin is 3.\n\nFirst condition: 3>4? No. So proceed to second step. pqmin.size < pqmax.size (3<4). Move one from pqmax to pqmin. Now sizes are 4 and 3. Then check first condition again (4>3). But the code does not loop. So the code ends here. So now, pqmin.size is 4, pqmax is 3. So pqmin is larger by 1.\n\nSo the code allows pqmin to be up to one element larger than pqmax. So after processing, pqmin can be equal to pqmax or one larger. Because after moving from pqmax to pqmin, the code does not check again whether pqmin is larger.\n\nThis suggests that after processing each insertion, the sizes of pqmin and pqmax can differ by at most one, with pqmin possibly being larger by one.\n\nTherefore, the min is the top of pqmin, and when a '2' query is processed, the code uses min multiplied by the sizes of the heaps and subtracts sum_min and sum_max.\n\nSo in Fortran, after each insertion, after rebalancing, min is set to pqmin(1) (the top of pqmin). So we need to make sure that the min-heap is properly maintained.\n\nNow, implementing the heaps.\n\nFirst, the min-heap:\n\nTo insert into a min-heap:\n\nAdd the new element to the end of the array (size increases by 1), then \"bubble up\" by comparing with parent until the parent is smaller.\n\nFor example:\n\nsubroutine insert_min_heap(val)\n    integer, intent(in) :: val\n    integer :: pos, parent_pos\n    size_min = size_min + 1\n    pqmin(size_min) = val\n    pos = size_min\n    do while (pos > 1)\n        parent_pos = pos / 2\n        if (pqmin(parent_pos) <= pqmin(pos)) exit\n        call swap(pqmin(parent_pos), pqmin(pos))\n        pos = parent_pos\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nBut in Fortran, the array indices start at 1. So for position pos, parent is pos/2 (integer division).\n\nSimilarly, for the max-heap insertion:\n\nsubroutine insert_max_heap(val)\n    integer, intent(in) :: val\n    integer :: pos, parent_pos\n    size_max = size_max + 1\n    pqmax(size_max) = val\n    pos = size_max\n    do while (pos > 1)\n        parent_pos = pos / 2\n        if (pqmax(parent_pos) >= pqmax(pos)) exit\n        call swap(pqmax(parent_pos), pqmax(pos))\n        pos = parent_pos\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nFor extracting the top element (min from min-heap, max from max-heap):\n\nFor min-heap extraction:\n\nfunction extract_min() result(val)\n    integer :: val\n    val = pqmin(1)\n    pqmin(1) = pqmin(size_min)\n    size_min = size_min - 1\n    ! bubble down\n    integer :: pos, left, right, smallest\n    pos = 1\n    do while (pos <= size_min / 2)\n        left = 2*pos\n        right = 2*pos +1\n        smallest = pos\n        if (left <= size_min .and. pqmin(left) < pqmin(smallest)) smallest = left\n        if (right <= size_min .and. pqmin(right) < pqmin(smallest)) smallest = right\n        if (smallest == pos) exit\n        call swap(pqmin(pos), pqmin(smallest))\n        pos = smallest\n    end do\nend function\n\nSimilarly for max-heap extraction:\n\nfunction extract_max() result(val)\n    integer :: val\n    val = pqmax(1)\n    pqmax(1) = pqmax(size_max)\n    size_max = size_max -1\n    ! bubble down\n    integer :: pos, left, right, largest\n    pos = 1\n    do while (pos <= size_max / 2)\n        left = 2*pos\n        right = 2*pos +1\n        largest = pos\n        if (left <= size_max .and. pqmax(left) > pqmax(largest)) largest = left\n        if (right <= size_max .and. pqmax(right) > pqmax(largest)) largest = right\n        if (largest == pos) exit\n        call swap(pqmax(pos), pqmax(largest))\n        pos = largest\n    end do\nend function\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can't modify module variables unless they are in a module. So perhaps we need to manage the heap arrays and sizes via module variables.\n\nAlternatively, pass them as arguments. But that's more complex. Using a module would be easier.\n\nSo, perhaps create a module for each heap, but that may complicate things. Alternatively, use global variables for the heaps and sizes.\n\nBut in Fortran, using modules to encapsulate variables is better.\n\nAlternatively, here's the plan:\n\n- Create a module for the min-heap and max-heap, containing their arrays and sizes, and subroutines for insertion and extraction.\n\nBut since the code requires two heaps (min and max), each with their own array and size, perhaps the module can have variables for both.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to manage them as separate variables.\n\nAlternatively, just use global variables.\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have global variables in the same way as other languages. Modules are the way to go.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nmodule heaps\n    implicit none\n    integer, allocatable :: pqmin(:), pqmax(:)\n    integer :: size_min = 0, size_max = 0\ncontains\n    subroutine insert_min(val)\n        integer, intent(in) :: val\n        integer :: pos, parent\n        size_min = size_min + 1\n        pqmin(size_min) = val\n        pos = size_min\n        do while (pos > 1)\n            parent = pos / 2\n            if (pqmin(parent) <= pqmin(pos)) exit\n            ! swap parent and pos\n            call swap(pqmin(parent), pqmin(pos))\n            pos = parent\n        end do\n    end subroutine insert_min\n\n    function extract_min() result(val)\n        integer :: val\n        integer :: pos, left, right, smallest\n        val = pqmin(1)\n        pqmin(1) = pqmin(size_min)\n        size_min = size_min -1\n        pos = 1\n        do while (pos <= size_min / 2)\n            left = 2*pos\n            right = 2*pos +1\n            smallest = pos\n            if (left <= size_min .and. pqmin(left) < pqmin(smallest)) smallest = left\n            if (right <= size_min .and. pqmin(right) < pqmin(smallest)) smallest = right\n            if (smallest == pos) exit\n            call swap(pqmin(pos), pqmin(smallest))\n            pos = smallest\n        end do\n    end function extract_min\n\n    subroutine insert_max(val)\n        integer, intent(in) :: val\n        integer :: pos, parent\n        size_max = size_max +1\n        pqmax(size_max) = val\n        pos = size_max\n        do while (pos > 1)\n            parent = pos / 2\n            if (pqmax(parent) >= pqmax(pos)) exit\n            call swap(pqmax(parent), pqmax(pos))\n            pos = parent\n        end do\n    end subroutine insert_max\n\n    function extract_max() result(val)\n        integer :: val\n        integer :: pos, left, right, largest\n        val = pqmax(1)\n        pqmax(1) = pqmax(size_max)\n        size_max = size_max -1\n        pos = 1\n        do while (pos <= size_max / 2)\n            left = 2*pos\n            right = 2*pos +1\n            largest = pos\n            if (left <= size_max .and. pqmax(left) > pqmax(largest)) largest = left\n            if (right <= size_max .and. pqmax(right) > pqmax(largest)) largest = right\n            if (largest == pos) exit\n            call swap(pqmax(pos), pqmax(largest))\n            pos = largest\n        end do\n    end function extract_max\n\n    subroutine swap(a, b)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: a, b\n        integer :: tmp\n        tmp = a\n        a = b\n        b = tmp\n    end subroutine swap\nend module heaps\n\nBut this is a bit lengthy, and in Fortran, the 'swap' subroutine can't be inside the module unless properly defined. Also, the arrays pqmin and pqmax are part of the module, so they need to be allocated before use.\n\nBut in the main program, after reading t, we need to allocate pqmin and pqmax with size t.\n\nWait, but in the module, pqmin and pqmax are declared as allocatable. So the main program would need to allocate them.\n\nSo the main program would look like:\n\nprogram main\n    use heaps\n    implicit none\n    integer :: t, i, a, b, val\n    character(len=20) :: line\n    integer :: query_type\n    integer :: min_val\n    integer :: status\n    integer :: pos\n    character(len=20), dimension(3) :: parts\n    real :: sum_b, sum_min, sum_max, ans, ans1\n\n    read(*,*) t\n    allocate(pqmin(t), pqmax(t))\n    size_min = 0\n    size_max = 0\n    sum_b = 0.0\n    sum_min = 0.0\n    sum_max = 0.0\n    min_val = 0\n\n    do i = 1, t\n        read(*, '(a)') line\n        ! Split the line into parts. For simplicity, assume that the line is split into parts separated by spaces.\n        parts = ' '\n        pos = 1\n        call split(line, ' ', parts, pos)\n\n        if (trim(parts(1)) == '2') then\n            !

First, the split subroutine is needed to parse the input lines. The Java code uses split(\" \") to split the input lines into parts. In Fortran, this requires a custom split function.\n\nImplementing a split function in Fortran:\n\nsubroutine split(line, delimiter, parts, count)\n    character(len=*), intent(in) :: line\n    character, intent(in) :: delimiter\n    character(len=*), dimension(:), intent(out) :: parts\n    integer, intent(out) :: count\n    integer :: i, j, k, len_line\n\n    len_line = len_trim(line)\n    count = 0\n    i = 1\n    j = 1\n\n    do while (i <= len_line)\n        ! skip leading delimiters\n        do while (i <= len_line .and. line(i:i) == delimiter)\n            i = i + 1\n        end do\n        if (i > len_line) exit\n\n        j = i\n        do while (j <= len_line .and. line(j:j) /= delimiter)\n            j = j +1\n        end do\n\n        count = count +1\n        if (count > size(parts)) exit\n        parts(count) = line(i:j-1)\n        i = j\n    end do\nend subroutine split\n\nBut this is a simplified version and may need adjustments.\n\nAlso, in the main program, after splitting the line into parts, we need to read a and b as integers, and b as a long (but in Fortran, integers can be 8-byte if necessary). But in the Java code, sum_b is a long. So in Fortran, sum_b should be of type integer(kind=8), as well as sum_min and sum_max.\n\nSo changing the variables:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: sum_b, sum_min, sum_max, ans, ans1, a, b\n\nBut when reading from parts(2) and (3), they can be large numbers. So in Fortran, use integer(kind=8) variables.\n\nSo adjusting variable declarations:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: sum_b = 0, sum_min = 0, sum_max = 0, ans, ans1, a, b\n\nBut in the code, when inserting into the heaps, a and the elements are integers. Wait, in Java, the code uses Integer.parseInt(s[1]), which is 32-bit integers. But sumMin and sumMax are longs (64-bit). So in Fortran, the elements in the heaps are integers (32-bit?), but sum_min and sum_max are 64-bit. But in Fortran, if variables are declared as integer(kind=8), then operations are 64-bit. So perhaps all variables should be 64-bit.\n\nSo perhaps declare a, b, val as integer(kind=8).\n\nBut in Fortran, the heap arrays (pqmin and pqmax) should hold the elements as 64-bit integers.\n\nSo adjusting the module:\n\nmodule heaps\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: pqmin(:), pqmax(:)\n    integer :: size_min = 0, size_max = 0\ncontains\n    subroutine insert_min(val)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: val\n        integer :: pos, parent\n        size_min = size_min + 1\n        pqmin(size_min) = val\n        pos = size_min\n        do while (pos > 1)\n            parent = pos / 2\n            if (pqmin(parent) <= pqmin(pos)) exit\n            call swap(pqmin(parent), pqmin(pos))\n            pos = parent\n        end do\n    contains\n        subroutine swap(a, b)\n            integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: a, b\n            integer(kind=8) :: tmp\n            tmp = a\n            a = b\n            b = tmp\n        end subroutine swap\n    end subroutine insert_min\n\n    function extract_min() result(val)\n        integer(kind=8) :: val\n        integer :: pos, left, right, smallest\n        val = pqmin(1)\n        pqmin(1) = pqmin(size_min)\n        size_min = size_min -1\n        pos = 1\n        do while (pos <= size_min / 2)\n            left = 2*pos\n            right = 2*pos +1\n            smallest = pos\n            if (left <= size_min) then\n                if (pqmin(left) < pqmin(smallest)) smallest = left\n            end if\n            if (right <= size_min) then\n                if (pqmin(right) < pqmin(smallest)) smallest = right\n            end if\n            if (smallest == pos) exit\n            call swap(pqmin(pos), pqmin(smallest))\n            pos = smallest\n        end do\n    contains\n        subroutine swap(a, b)\n            integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: a, b\n            integer(kind=8) :: tmp\n            tmp = a\n            a = b\n            b = tmp\n        end subroutine swap\n    end function extract_min\n\n    subroutine insert_max(val)\n        integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: val\n        integer :: pos, parent\n        size_max = size_max +1\n        pqmax(size_max) = val\n        pos = size_max\n        do while (pos > 1)\n            parent = pos / 2\n            if (pqmax(parent) >= pqmax(pos)) exit\n            call swap(pqmax(parent), pqmax(pos))\n            pos = parent\n        end do\n    contains\n        subroutine swap(a, b)\n            integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: a, b\n            integer(kind=8) :: tmp\n            tmp = a\n            a = b\n            b = tmp\n        end subroutine swap\n    end subroutine insert_max\n\n    function extract_max() result(val)\n        integer(kind=8) :: val\n        integer :: pos, left, right, largest\n        val = pqmax(1)\n        pqmax(1) = pqmax(size_max)\n        size_max = size_max -1\n        pos = 1\n        do while (pos <= size_max / 2)\n            left = 2*pos\n            right = 2*pos +1\n            largest = pos\n            if (left <= size_max) then\n                if (pqmax(left) > pqmax(largest)) largest = left\n            end if\n            if (right <= size_max) then\n                if (pqmax(right) > pqmax(largest)) largest = right\n            end if\n            if (largest == pos) exit\n            call swap(pqmax(pos), pqmax(largest))\n            pos = largest\n        end do\n    contains\n        subroutine swap(a, b)\n            integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: a, b\n            integer(kind=8) :: tmp\n            tmp = a\n            a = b\n            b = tmp\n        end subroutine swap\n    end function extract_max\n\nend module heaps\n\nBut this may not compile due to the nested subroutines (swap inside each function). Alternatively, move the swap subroutine to the module level.\n\nBut in Fortran, each function or subroutine can have internal subroutines. So perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the main program needs to read the input lines, split into parts, and process accordingly.\n\nBut splitting the input line into parts can be tricky. In Java, the code uses split on spaces, so for example, a line like '1 123 456' is split into three parts. So in Fortran, we need to split the input line into three parts, the first being the query type, the second and third being a and b.\n\nBut in the code, for query type '2', there are no other parameters, so the line would have only one part.\n\nSo adjusting the split subroutine to handle variable numbers of parts.\n\nBut in the main program, the code can check the query type first. For type '2', there are no a and b. For type '1', there are.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nAfter splitting the line into parts, check parts(1). If it's '2', proceed. Else, read a and b from parts(2) and parts(3).\n\nBut in Fortran, when the line has only one part (like '2'), parts(2) and parts(3) may be empty. So need to handle that.\n\nBut the code in Java's case checks for s[0].charAt(0) == '2', which implies that the first token is '2'.\n\nSo in Fortran, after splitting the line into parts, if parts(1) is '2', then handle query type 2. Else, it's type 1, and read a and b from parts(2) and parts(3).\n\nSo in the main program:\n\nread(*, '(a)') line\n\ncall split(line, ' ', parts, num_parts)\n\nif (trim(parts(1)) == '2') then\n    ! process query 2\nelse\n    ! process query 1: parts(2) is a, parts(3) is b\nend if\n\nBut the split function needs to return the number of parts.\n\nSo modifying the split subroutine to return the number of parts.\n\nSo the split subroutine should have an argument 'num_parts' that indicates how many parts were found.\n\nRewriting the split subroutine:\n\nsubroutine split(line, delimiter, parts, num_parts)\n    character(len=*), intent(in) :: line\n    character, intent(in) :: delimiter\n    character(len=*), dimension(:), intent(out) :: parts\n    integer, intent(out) :: num_parts\n    integer :: i, j, k, len_line\n\n    len_line = len_trim(line)\n    num_parts = 0\n    i = 1\n\n    do while (i <= len_line)\n        ! skip leading delimiters\n        do while (i <= len_line .and. line(i:i) == delimiter)\n            i = i + 1\n        end do\n        if (i > len_line) exit\n\n        j = i\n        do while (j <= len_line .and. line(j:j) /= delimiter)\n            j = j + 1\n        end do\n\n        num_parts = num_parts + 1\n        if (num_parts > size(parts)) exit\n        parts(num_parts) = line(i:j-1)\n        i = j\n    end do\nend subroutine split\n\nNow, in the main program, after splitting, parts(1) is the first part, and num_parts is the count.\n\nSo in code:\n\ncall split(line, ' ', parts, num_parts)\n\nif (num_parts == 0) then\n    cycle ! empty line?\nelse if (trim(parts(1)) == '2') then\n    ! handle query 2\nelse\n    if (num_parts < 3) then\n        ! error, but according to problem statement, input is correct\n    end if\n    read(parts(2), *) a\n    read(parts(3), *) b\n    ! proceed\nend if\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in Fortran, the heap arrays (pqmin and pqmax) are allocated with size t. But during insertion, when the size exceeds t, it would cause an error. But since each '1' query adds exactly one element, and there are t queries, the maximum number of elements is t. So allocating pqmin and pqmax with size t is sufficient.\n\nBut in the code, after each insertion and rebalancing, the sizes can't exceed t. So the allocation is safe.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nFor example, when the heaps are empty. But in the code, during insertion, the first element is added to either heap. Then during rebalancing, if the sizes differ by more than 1, elements are moved. But initially, when inserting the first element:\n\nmin_val is initially 0.\n\nIf a is inserted, and a >0, then added to pqmax. sum_max +=a.\n\nThen, check if size_min > size_max (0>0? no). Then check if size_max > size_min (0>0? no). So min_val is pqmin(1), but pqmin is empty. So this would cause an error.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because in the Java code, after inserting the first element, which is added to pqmax (if a>0), then during rebalancing:\n\nAfter insertion, pqmax has size 1, pqmin has size 0.\n\nThen, check if pqmin.size() > pqmax.size() (0>1? no).\n\nThen check if pqmin.size() < pqmax.size() (0<1? yes).\n\nSo move from pqmax to pqmin.\n\nBut pqmax has one element, extract_max() would return that element. Then inserted into pqmin. Now pqmax is size 0, pqmin is size 1. sum_max becomes 0, sum_min becomes a.\n\nThen, min_val is pqmin(1), which is the element.\n\nSo in the code, after the first insertion, the heaps are rebalanced.\n\nSo the code ensures that after each insertion, the heaps are balanced, and pqmin is not empty. So in Fortran code, after rebalancing, pqmin should have at least one element, so min_val is set to pqmin(1).\n\nBut in Fortran code, after insertion and rebalancing, we have:\n\nif (size_min > size_max) then\n    val = extract_min()\n    insert into max heap\nend if\n\nif (size_max > size_min) then\n    val = extract_max()\n    insert into min heap\nend if\n\nThen, min_val is set to pqmin(1) if size_min >0.\n\nBut in the case of inserting the first element (a=5):\n\nInitially, a>0 (assuming min_val is 0), so insert into pqmax. sum_max=5.\n\nsize_max=1, size_min=0.\n\nCheck size_min < size_max: yes. Extract_max (5), insert into pqmin. Now size_min=1, size_max=0. sum_min=5, sum_max=0.\n\nmin_val = pqmin(1) =5.\n\nSo correct.\n\nSo the code should handle this correctly.\n\nBut in Fortran, during the first iteration, after processing the '1' query, the code sets min_val to pqmin(1), which is valid.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. The split function may not correctly parse the input lines. For example, leading or trailing spaces.\n\nBut the Java code uses split on the regex \" \", which splits on any number of spaces. So in Fortran, the split subroutine should split on any number of spaces.\n\nBut the current split subroutine splits on single spaces. So if the input line has multiple spaces between parts, the split may not work correctly.\n\nFor example, input line '1  123 456' (two spaces between 1 and 123). The current split subroutine would handle this because it skips leading delimiters.\n\nYes, in the split subroutine:\n\ni starts at 1. The first do while skips all delimiters (spaces), then captures the first part. So multiple spaces are treated as a single delimiter.\n\nSo the split subroutine should work.\n\nAnother issue: when reading the parts(2) and (3) as integers, if they are empty or not numbers, but according to the problem statement, the inputs are correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the Fortran code should look like this."
