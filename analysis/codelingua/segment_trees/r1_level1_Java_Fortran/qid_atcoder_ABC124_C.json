So correct. But in the code above, when we loop i from len_s down to 2, for each i, we check i and i-1, then flip i-1. But after flipping i-1, when moving to i-1 in the loop (since i is decreasing), the next step is i-1, but the loop is in reverse order. For example, if len_s is 3, the loop is i=3, then i=2. After processing i=3 (changing i-1=2), when processing i=2, we check i=2 and i-1=1. The previous step's flip may have affected i=2. So the code is correct. But wait, the original Java code modifies the b string in each step. So in Fortran, the code is correct because we modify the b string as we go. Yes. So the Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java logic.",

So a(3:3) is the third character. But when you assign a = s, since a is a character(len=100000), and s is also len=100000, but after reading, s contains the input string (left-justified, with trailing spaces). So for example, if the input is \"010\", then s is \"010\" followed by 99997 spaces. Then a is also \"010\" followed by spaces. But in the loops, when we process up to len_s (3), the code checks a(i:i) where i ranges up to 3, which are the relevant characters. But in Fortran, when you assign a = s, it's left-justified.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe problem seems to be about finding the minimum number of changes needed to make a string of 0s and 1s alternate colors. The code calculates two possible scenarios: one where it starts with the first character and alternates, and another where maybe it starts with the opposite. Then it takes the minimum of those two possibilities.\n\nLooking at the Java code, the main class reads input, processes it with the CColoringColorfully class. The solve method takes the input string x, creates two StringBuilders a and b. Then, for a, it iterates from the start, checking if consecutive characters are the same. If they are, it flips the current character and increments a1 counter. For b, it iterates from the end, flipping the previous character and incrementing a2. Finally, it outputs the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Fortran doesn't have StringBuilders, so I'll need to use character arrays or strings. Also, Fortran is case-insensitive, but I'll stick to uppercase for keywords for readability.\n\nFirst, the input: in Java, it's reading a line. In Fortran, I can read the input as a character string. The main steps are:\n\n1. Read the input string.\n2. Compute two possible scenarios:\n   a. Check from left to right, flipping as needed.\n   b. Check from right to left, flipping as needed.\n3. Take the minimum of the two counts and print it.\n\nLet me think about how to handle the flipping. For scenario a (left to right), start with the first character. For each position i (starting from 1), check if it's the same as i-1. If so, flip the current character (since we want alternation). Each flip increments the count.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, for 'a', they check from i=1 to end. If the current character is same as previous, flip current. So, for example, if the string is \"000\", then first compare 0 and 0 (positions 0 and 1), flip to 01, then next compare 1 and position 2 (original 0), now they are different. So the count would be 1. Wait, but the flipped string would be 010. So the count here is 1.\n\nFor scenario b, they process from the end. For each i from end to 1, check if i and i-1 are same. If so, flip the previous character (i-1). So in the same example \"000\", processing from right:\n\ni=2 (third character), compare with i-1=1. Both are 0. Flip i-1 (position 1) to 1. Now the string is \"010\". a2 is incremented by 1. Then i=1, compare 1 (which is now 1) and 0 (position 0). Different, so no change. So a2 is 1. So the minimum is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo the logic is that for each scenario, you flip the necessary characters to make the string alternate, but the two scenarios might have different flipping strategies, leading to different counts. The minimum of these is taken.\n\nIn Fortran, since strings are fixed-length, we can work with a character array. Let's see.\n\nFirst, read the input string. Then, create two copies, a and b. Then process each as per the scenarios.\n\nBut wait, the Java code for scenario a modifies the current character (i) if it's same as previous. For scenario b, it modifies the previous character (i-1) when i and i-1 are same.\n\nSo for the first scenario (a), when i is 1 to length-1:\n\nif a[i] == a[i-1], then flip a[i], increment a1.\n\nFor scenario b, when i is from length-1 down to 1:\n\nif b[i] == b[i-1], flip b[i-1], increment a2.\n\nSo the key difference is which character is being flipped (current vs previous) and the direction of iteration (left to right vs right to left).\n\nSo in Fortran, let's model this.\n\nLet's process the first scenario:\n\nInitialize a1 to 0.\n\nCreate a copy of the input string, let's call it a.\n\nLoop i from 2 to len (since Fortran indices start at 1).\n\nAt each step, compare a(i) and a(i-1). If they are equal, flip a(i), increment a1.\n\nFor example, if original is \"000\":\n\ni=2: compare 0 and 0. Flip a(2) to 1. a1=1. Now a is \"010\".\ni=3: compare a(3) (original 0) and a(2) (1). Different. Do nothing. So a1=1.\n\nSecond scenario:\n\nInitialize a2 to 0.\n\nCreate copy b of input string.\n\nLoop i from len down to 2:\n\nCompare b(i) and b(i-1). If same, flip b(i-1), increment a2.\n\nTake original \"000\":\n\ni=3, compare 0 and 0. Flip b(2) to 1. a2=1. Now b is \"010\".\ni=2: compare b(2) (1) and b(1) (0). Different. Do nothing.\ni=1: loop ends.\n\nSo both scenarios give a1=1 and a2=1. So min is 1.\n\nNow, the Fortran code needs to handle this.\n\nBut in Fortran, strings can be manipulated as character arrays. Let's see:\n\nFirst, read the input string. Let's assume it's read into a variable, say, s.\n\nThen, create two copies: a and b.\n\nFor processing a:\n\nn = len_trim(s)  ! assuming no trailing spaces, but depends on input.\n\nBut in Java, the code uses x.length(), which is the actual length of the string. So in Fortran, the input should be read properly.\n\nWait, in Java, the code reads the input via next(), which reads a token, so the string is without whitespace. So in Fortran, when reading, we need to read the entire line as the input string.\n\nIn Fortran, the code would be something like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC124_C\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100000) :: s, a, b\n    integer :: i, a1, a2, len_s\n\n    read(*, '(a)') s\n    len_s = len_trim(s)  ! get the actual length of the input string without trailing spaces\n\n    if (len_s == 0) then\n        print *, 0\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    a = s\n    a1 = 0\n    do i = 2, len_s\n        if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n            if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n                a(i:i) = '0'\n            else\n                a(i:i) = '1'\n            end if\n            a1 = a1 + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    b = s\n    a2 = 0\n    do i = len_s, 2, -1\n        if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n            if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n                b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n            else\n                b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n            end if\n            a2 = a2 + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, min(a1, a2)\n\nend program atcoder_ABC124_C\n\nWait, but in the scenario for b, when iterating from len_s down to 2, for each i, check b[i] and b[i-1]. If they are same, flip b[i-1], then increment a2. So after flipping, the next characters (to the left) may be affected. Let's see:\n\nFor example, input \"000\":\n\nProcessing b:\n\ni=3: compare 0 and 0. Flip i-1 (2) to 1. Now b is \"010\". a2=1.\n\ni=2: compare b[2] (1) and b[1] (0). No change.\n\ni=1: loop ends.\n\nSo correct.\n\nBut in the code above, when we loop i from len_s down to 2, for each i, we check i and i-1, then flip i-1.\n\nBut after flipping i-1, when moving to i-1 in the loop (since i is decreasing), the next step is i-1, but the loop is in reverse order. For example, if len_s is 3, the loop is i=3, then i=2. After processing i=3 (changing i-1=2), when processing i=2, we check i=2 and i-1=1. The previous step's flip may have affected i=2. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, the original Java code modifies the b string in each step. So in Fortran, the code is correct because we modify the b string as we go.\n\nYes. So the Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java logic.\n\nNow, some possible issues:\n\n1. The initial input may have leading or trailing spaces. But the Java code uses next() which reads the next token. So in Fortran, we need to read the entire line, but trim any leading/trailing whitespace. Or perhaps read the line and then trim. Alternatively, in Fortran, the read(*,'(a)') s will read the entire line, including leading spaces. But if the input is like \" 001 \", then len_trim(s) would return 3. But the problem statement probably expects the input to be a string of 0s and 1s with no leading/trailing spaces. So maybe using trim(s) when processing. But in the Java code, the next() method returns the next token, so leading/trailing whitespace is ignored. So in Fortran, perhaps after reading s, we need to adjust it to trim leading and trailing whitespace. Or perhaps in the problem, the input is given as a single line with no spaces, so the code can read the entire line and use len_trim(s) as the length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use len_trim(s) to get the actual length. But in the code, the Java code uses x.length(), which is the length of the string read, which would be the entire token. So in Fortran, after reading the line, trimming leading and trailing whitespace may be necessary. Wait, no. For example, if the input is \"  0101  \", then next() in Java would return \"0101\", trimming the surrounding whitespace. So in Fortran, perhaps after reading the entire line, we need to adjust the string by trimming leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\ns = adjustl(s)  ! remove leading spaces\ns = trim(adjustl(s))  ! trim leading and trailing spaces, leaving just the string.\n\nWait, adjustl(s) moves leading spaces to the end, then trim removes trailing (which were leading) spaces. So perhaps:\n\ns = trim(adjustl(s))  ! trim leading and trailing spaces.\n\nBut maybe there are cases where there are spaces in between? The problem statement says the input is a string consisting of 0 and 1. So the input should be a single line with no spaces. So the code can read the entire line and trim any leading/trailing whitespace. So in Fortran, after reading s, we can process it as:\n\ns = trim(adjustl(s))  ! this may not be necessary if the input has no leading spaces, but perhaps better to handle.\n\nBut if the input is, say, ' 001', then adjustl moves leading spaces to the end, then trim removes them, leaving '001'. Similarly for trailing spaces.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = trim(adjustl(s))\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nBut in Fortran, the adjustl function left-justifies the string, moving leading spaces to the end. Then trim removes trailing spaces. So combining adjustl and trim effectively gives the string without leading or trailing spaces.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is a string of 0s and 1s with no spaces, so perhaps it's safe. But to mimic Java's next(), which reads the next token (split by whitespace), we need to read the first token. So perhaps in Fortran, reading the first token would be better.\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have a direct way to read tokens like Java's StringTokenizer. Alternatively, using list-directed input.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if you read using list-directed input (i.e., read(*, *) s), then it will read the first token, splitting on whitespace. So perhaps:\n\nread(*, *) s\n\nThis way, leading and trailing whitespace are ignored, and the first sequence of non-whitespace characters is read into s. Then len_trim(s) gives the correct length.\n\nSo modifying the code to use read(*,*) s, which reads the input as a token. That would be better.\n\nSo the code would start with:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC124_C\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100000) :: s, a, b\n    integer :: i, a1, a2, len_s\n\n    read(*, *) s  ! read the input as a token (like Java's next())\n    len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n    if (len_s == 0) then\n        print *, 0\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    a = s\n    a1 = 0\n    do i = 2, len_s\n        if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n            if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n                a(i:i) = '0'\n            else\n                a(i:i) = '1'\n            end if\n            a1 = a1 + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    b = s\n    a2 = 0\n    do i = len_s, 2, -1\n        if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n            if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n                b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n            else\n                b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n            end if\n            a2 = a2 + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, min(a1, a2)\n\nend program atcoder_ABC124_C\n\nBut in Fortran, the length of the character variable is fixed when declared. So when s is declared as len=100000, but the actual input may be shorter. len_trim(s) gives the position of the last non-blank character. So when we assign a = s, a will have leading part as the string, and the rest filled with spaces. But when we process a(i:i), for i up to len_s, which is the length of the original string. But since a's length is 100000, but we only process up to len_s, the code should work.\n\nWait, for example, if the input string is \"010\", len_s is 3. Then a is assigned to s, which is \"010\" followed by spaces. So in a(4:4), which is beyond len_s, it's a space. But in the loops, we process up to len_s, which is 3. So a(3:3) is the third character.\n\nBut when you assign a = s, since a is a character(len=100000), and s is also len=100000, but after reading, s contains the input string (left-justified, with trailing spaces). So for example, if the input is \"010\", then s is \"010\" followed by 99997 spaces. Then a is also \"010\" followed by spaces. But in the loops, when we process up to len_s (3), the code checks a(i:i) where i ranges up to 3, which are the relevant characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you assign a = s, it's left-justified. So the first len_s characters are the input, followed by spaces. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the loops:\n\nFor a, loop i from 2 to len_s. Each time compare a(i) and a(i-1). If same, flip a(i), increment a1.\n\nBut modifying a(i) in the loop affects subsequent iterations, as the code builds the alternating pattern. Which is correct, as per the Java code.\n\nSimilarly for b, loop from len_s down to 2. For each i, compare b(i) and b(i-1). If same, flip b(i-1), which affects the next characters (earlier positions) as we process from the end. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting with input \"0\", len_s is 1. Then the loops for a and b would not run (since a starts at 2, which is > len_s=1, and the loop for b runs from 1 down to 2, which is invalid). So a1 and a2 are 0. The min is 0. Which is correct (no changes needed).\n\nAnother test case: input \"1\". Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: input \"01\". len_s=2. For a, i=2: compare a(2) and a(1). 1 and 0, different. So a1 remains 0. For b, i=2: compare 1 and 0, different. a2 remains 0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input \"000\". As discussed earlier, outputs 1.\n\nAnother case: input \"0011\".\n\nScenario a:\n\nOriginal a: 0011.\n\ni=2: compare a(2) (0) and a(1) (0). Same. Flip a(2) to 1. a1=1. Now a is 0111.\n\ni=3: compare a(3) (1) and a(2) (1). Same. Flip a(3) to 0. a1=2. Now a is 0101.\n\ni=4: compare a(4) (1) and a(3) (0). Different. No change. So a1=2.\n\nScenario b:\n\nOriginal b: 0011.\n\nProcess i=4: compare b(4) (1) and b(3) (1). Same. Flip b(3) to 0. a2=1. Now b is 0010.\n\ni=3: compare b(3) (0) and b(2) (1). Different.\n\ni=2: compare b(2) (1) and b(1) (0). Different.\n\nSo a2=1.\n\nSo min(2,1) = 1. So output is 1.\n\nBut what's the correct answer? Let's see:\n\nOriginal string is 0011.\n\nScenario 1: flipping to alternate starting with first character.\n\nOriginal: 0 0 1 1.\n\nFirst, make sure each character alternates.\n\nIf we want 0 1 0 1.\n\nBut the a scenario processes left to right, flipping current when same as previous.\n\nOriginal a is 0011.\n\ni=2: same as previous (0), flip to 1. Now 0111. a1=1.\n\ni=3: same as previous (1), flip to 0. Now 0101. a1=2.\n\nSo a1=2.\n\nScenario b processes right to left, flipping previous when same.\n\nOriginal b is 0011.\n\ni=4: compare 4 and 3. Both 1. Flip 3 to 0. Now 0010. a2=1.\n\ni=3: compare 3 (0) and 2 (1). Different.\n\ni=2: compare 2 (1) and 1 (0). Different.\n\nSo a2=1. So min is 1.\n\nBut what's the minimal number of changes needed? The correct answer for input \"0011\" would be 2.\n\nWait, but according to the code's approach, the answer would be 1. But that's conflicting. Let's see:\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code. Let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nThe code for scenario a and scenario b may not cover all possibilities. Because the two scenarios are two different ways to alternate the pattern. For example, scenario a could result in a pattern starting with 0, then 1, then 0, etc. But scenario b's approach may result in a different pattern, perhaps starting with 1, then 0, then 1. The code is taking the minimal of the two approaches. But perhaps the correct way is to consider both possible starting patterns (starting with 0 or 1) and compute the minimal flips for each, then take the minimum of those two.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, scenario a is flipping characters to ensure that each character is different from the previous, starting from the left. But perhaps this results in a pattern that starts with the first character. For example, if the first two characters are same, scenario a will flip the second to be different. Then the third character must be different from the second, etc. But this may not be the minimal possible flips. Similarly for scenario b, which starts from the right.\n\nBut according to the Java code's approach, the two scenarios are two different ways to flip the characters. For example, in the first scenario, the code makes sure that each character is different from the previous, starting from the left, flipping the current character. In the second scenario, starting from the right, flipping the previous character. The code then takes the minimal of the two counts. But perhaps this approach is not considering all possibilities, but the problem's correct solution requires this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Java code is correct. Let's see the problem statement.\n\nThe problem is atcoder ABC124 C: Coloring Colorfully. Let me recall: the problem is to find the minimal number of changes needed to make the string alternate between 0 and 1. There are two possible valid patterns: starting with 0, then 1, etc. or starting with 1, then 0, etc. The minimal flips between these two possibilities is the answer.\n\nBut the Java code's approach is not directly computing these two possibilities. Instead, it's processing the string in two different ways, leading to two counts, and taking the minimum of them. But why would that be equivalent to the minimal of the two possible valid patterns?\n\nWait, perhaps the Java code's approach is not correct, but according to the problem's sample inputs, let's see.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n000\n\nSample Output 1:\n\n1\n\nWhich matches our previous analysis.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n10010010\n\nSample Output 2:\n\n3\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct for the problem.\n\nBut regardless, the task is to translate the Java code into Fortran, not to correct the logic. So the Fortran code should replicate the Java code's behavior.\n\nThus, the code I wrote should correctly mirror the Java code.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in Fortran, the strings are handled correctly. For example, when creating a and b as copies of s, then modifying them. Fortran's character variables are fixed-length, so when you assign a = s, a gets the same characters as s, up to the length of a, which is 100000. But the code processes only up to len_s, so the trailing spaces are not considered.\n\nAnother possible issue: in Fortran, when you assign a character variable to another, if the lengths differ, the assignment is done by truncating or padding with spaces. Since a and s are declared with the same length (100000), this is not a problem.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran code is as written above, with the read(*, *) s to read the input as a token, and loops processing the a and b strings."
