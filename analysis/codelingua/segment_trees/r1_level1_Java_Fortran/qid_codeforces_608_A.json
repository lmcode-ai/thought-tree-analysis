The main method reads integers n and s, then processes n pairs of integers f and t. It finds the maximum value of f + t among all pairs, then outputs the maximum between this value and s.\n\nHmm, in Java, they're using a Scanner and a FastScanner class, but the main part uses sc.nextInt() for input. So, in Fortran, I need to read from standard input. Fortran uses READ statements for input. Let's start with that.\n\nFirst, read n and s. In Fortran, variables need to be declared. So variables like n, s, max, f, t, i would be integers. Then, loop n times, reading f and t each time, and keep track of the maximum f + t.\n\nWait, the loop in Java is a while loop that decrements n. In Fortran, since n is read from input, maybe we should use a do loop from 1 to n. But wait, the Java code uses while (n-- > 0), which loops n times. So in Fortran, we can loop n times.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n and s.\n2. Initialize max to 0.\n3. Loop n times:\n   a. Read f and t.\n   b. If f + t is greater than current max, update max.\n4. After the loop, compute the maximum between max and s.\n5. Print that result.\n\nNow, Fortran's syntax. For reading input, use READ(*,*) to read from standard input. But sometimes, when reading multiple values, each READ statement might read a new line. But in this problem, each input line might have two integers for each f and t, but the Java code uses sc.nextInt() which reads tokens, so maybe in Fortran, each pair f and t is read from the same line.\n\nWait, the original code uses sc.nextInt() for each f and t. So each pair is read from the same line, or any available input. So in Fortran, each READ(*,*) f, t would read two integers from the same line, which should work as long as the input lines are structured that way.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nProgram structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_608_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, s, max_val, f, t, i\n\n    read(*,*) n, s\n    max_val = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) f, t\n        if (f + t > max_val) then\n            max_val = f + t\n        end if\n    end do\n    write(*,*) max(max_val, s)\nend program codeforces_608_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the max function can take two arguments. So max(max_val, s) is correct.\n\nBut need to make sure that variables are properly declared. Also, in Fortran, variable names can't have the same name as the intrinsic function max. Oh right, the Java code uses 'max' as a variable, but Fortran's max is a function. So in Fortran, the variable should be named something else, like max_val.\n\nYes, in the original code, the variable is 'max', but that's a problem in Fortran. So changing it to max_val is necessary.\n\nAlso, in the Java code, the print statement is Math.max(max, s). So in Fortran, that's the max function.\n\nSo that should work.\n\nWait, the original code's logic is to compute the maximum of all (f + t) values, then compare that with s and take the larger. So if s is larger than the maximum (f + t), then output s. Otherwise, output the maximum (f + t).\n\nSo the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nTesting the code with sample input would help, but assuming that the input is correctly read, this code should work.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran's READ can sometimes have issues with leftover input, but assuming that the input is properly formatted with each pair f and t on separate lines or the same line as needed.\n\nSo the translated code should be as above."
