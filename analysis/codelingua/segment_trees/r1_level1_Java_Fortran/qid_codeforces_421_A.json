But how to know when it's the last iteration. But since n is read from input, we can loop from 1 to n, and for each i, check if it's the last element. For example:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n   if (i == n) then\n      write(*, '(I0)', advance='no') num\n   else\n      write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') num, ' '\n   end if\nend do\n\nBut this requires knowing whether i is the last element.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does. The program reads three integers n, a, and b. Then it reads a list of a integers and another list of b integers. For each number from 1 to n, it checks if the current number (i+1) is in the first list. If yes, it prints 1, else 2. \n\nFortran is a bit different. Let's start with reading the inputs. In Java, they use Scanner, but in Fortran, we'll use READ statements. \n\nFirst, the variables. The Java code uses int for n, a, b. In Fortran, they can be integers. The lists are ArrayLists in Java. Since the elements in the lists are integers, in Fortran we can use arrays. But since the size of the lists is determined by a and b, which are inputs, we need to allocate them dynamically. \n\nWait, in Fortran, you can declare allocatable arrays. So for list1 and list2, we can declare them as integer, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:). Then read a and b, allocate them, and then read the elements into them. \n\nBut how to check if a number is in the list? In Java, there's the contains method. In Fortran, there's no built-in function for that. So I'll have to loop through the array and check each element. \n\nSo for each i from 1 to n, check if i is present in list1. If yes, output 1, else 2. \n\nWait, the Java code uses i+1 because the loop is from 0 to n-1 (since it's 0-based in the loop). Wait, the Java loop is for (int i = 0; i < n; i++). So i runs from 0 to n-1, and checks if i+1 is in list1. So in Fortran, the loop can be do i=1, n, and check if i is in list1. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, a, b.\n\n2. Read a integers into list1.\n\n3. Read b integers into list2.\n\n4. For each i from 1 to n, check if i is in list1. If yes, print 1; else, print 2.\n\nBut how to check if i is in list1. For that, we can loop through each element of list1 and see if any element equals i. Alternatively, for each i, loop through list1 and set a flag if found.\n\nSo let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ninteger :: n, a, b, i, j\n\ninteger, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:)\n\nlogical :: found\n\nRead *, n, a, b\n\nThen allocate list1 and list2.\n\nallocate(list1(a))\n\nallocate(list2(b))\n\nRead list1 elements. In Fortran, the read statement can read the entire array if the input is given correctly. So read *, list1. Similarly for list2.\n\nThen, loop from i=1 to n:\n\nfound = .false.\n\ndo j=1, a\n\n   if (list1(j) == i) then\n\n      found = .true.\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (found) then\n\n   write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') 1, ' '\n\nelse\n\n   write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') 2, ' '\n\nend if\n\nBut in Fortran, the output with advance='no' can be tricky because after the loop, we might need a line break. But in Java, the code prints each number followed by a space. So in Fortran, if we use advance='no', each write adds to the same line. However, after the loop, we need to print a newline. Wait, looking at the Java code, it's using System.out.print(1 + \" \"), which adds a space after each number. So the output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. In Fortran, when using advance='no', each write appends to the current line. So after processing all i, we need to print a newline. But the Java code doesn't add a newline at the end. However, the Fortran program's output might need to have a newline at the end. Wait, in the Java code, after printing all n numbers with a space after each, the output ends with a space. But maybe the problem expects that. However, sometimes trailing spaces can be problematic. But according to the original code, the Java code does print a space after each element, including the last one. So the Fortran code should do the same. \n\nSo for each i from 1 to n, we write '1 ' or '2 ', with no line break. After all, the line is complete, but in Fortran, if you use advance='no' for all writes, you might need to issue a newline at the end. Otherwise, the output might not be properly flushed. But the original code doesn't have a newline. Hmm. Maybe the Java code just outputs the numbers separated by spaces, ending with a space. But in some cases, this might not be desired. However, the problem might expect that. So perhaps in Fortran, after the loop, we can write a newline. But the original code doesn't. Let me check: in Java, each print is \"1 \" or \"2 \", so after n iterations, the output is a sequence of numbers with a space after each. The last character is a space. Then, the program ends. So in Fortran, the code would write each number followed by a space, but the final line would end with a space, and no newline. However, in Fortran, when using advance='no', after the loop, the program might automatically add a newline upon termination. I'm not sure. To be safe, perhaps after the loop, we can print a newline. But wait, the original Java code does not. So perhaps in Fortran, the code should not print a newline. But when you run a Fortran program, each write statement that doesn't have advance='no' will add a newline. But in our case, we are using advance='no', so all the outputs are on the same line, with spaces. Then, when the program exits, the output may or may not have a newline. But this depends on the system. For example, in some systems, the output may not appear until a newline is printed. So perhaps adding a newline at the end is better. But according to the problem's original code, the Java code does not. So the user might expect the same. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can collect all the outputs into a string and then print them once. But for simplicity, perhaps use the approach of writing each number with a space, and after the loop, print a newline. Or maybe not. Let's see.\n\nBut the original code's output in Java would be a line with n numbers, each followed by a space, ending with a space. For example, if n=3, the output is \"1 2 1 \" (for example). However, when printed in the console, the trailing space may not matter. But perhaps the problem expects that. So in Fortran, we can do the same.\n\nBut in Fortran, using write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') 1, ' ' would write '1 ' and stay on the same line. After the loop, the program ends, and the output may be flushed with a newline. Or not. To avoid any issues, maybe after the loop, we can write a newline. But perhaps the problem expects the output to have a trailing space. Let's look at the problem's original code. The code uses System.out.print(1 + \" \"), so each iteration adds a space. For n=3, the output would be \"1 2 1 \" (if list1 contains 1 and 3, for example). So a trailing space. In Fortran, if we output each with a space, then the trailing space is there. Then, when the program ends, maybe the Fortran runtime adds a newline. So perhaps in the Fortran code, after the loop, we need to output a newline. Otherwise, the output might have the numbers followed by a space, but not a newline, which could be problematic. For example, in programming competition problems, trailing spaces are often allowed. But in some cases, they are not. However, according to the original code, the Java code's output would have a trailing space. So to replicate that exactly, perhaps the Fortran code should not add a newline. But in practice, how can we prevent the Fortran program from adding a newline at the end?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps collect the output into a string and print it all at once. But that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use the format for each write statement as '(I0, 1X)', advance='no', but then after the loop, write a newline. Wait, but the original code doesn't have a newline. Hmm. This is a bit of a problem.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed with writing each number followed by a space, using advance='no', and then at the end, write a newline. Let's see. For example:\n\ndo i=1, n\n   ! ... determine if to print 1 or 2\n   write(*, '(I0, \" \")', advance='no') num\nend do\nprint *, ''\n\nBut then the final print would add a newline. But the original code doesn't have that. Hmm. This is a bit of a dilemma.\n\nWait, the original Java code outputs each number with a space, and the last character is a space. Then, the program ends. In Java, when you print using System.out.print, the output is buffered and may not appear until a newline is printed. But the Java code does not print a newline. So the output would be a line with the numbers and spaces, but no newline. However, in practice, when the program terminates, the output buffer is flushed, and the line is printed as is. So the output would have a trailing space. \n\nIn Fortran, if we write each number with a space using advance='no', the output buffer will collect all of them, and when the program ends, the buffer is flushed, which would output the line without a newline. But in many systems, the console might automatically add a newline when the program exits, but this is system-dependent. However, for programming competition problems, the judges usually ignore trailing spaces and/or newlines. But to be precise, perhaps we can replicate the Java code's behavior.\n\nBut how to handle this in Fortran. Let me check: if I have a loop that writes using advance='no' and then after the loop, do nothing. Then, when the program ends, what happens. In Fortran, the standard requires that each record (line) is terminated with a newline. So, if you write a series of characters without a newline, the Fortran runtime may automatically add a newline when the program terminates. So in this case, the output would have a trailing space followed by a newline. But the original Java code does not have a newline. So this could be a problem.\n\nWait, in programming competition problems, it's common that trailing spaces are allowed. So even if the Fortran code adds a trailing space and a newline, the judge may accept it. For example, if the problem expects the output as \"1 2 3 \", and the code outputs \"1 2 3 \\n\", it might be considered correct. But maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can build a string and then print it without a trailing space. But that's more complicated. Let's see. For example, in Fortran, after processing all elements, remove the last space. But how?\n\nAn alternative approach: collect all the output in a character variable and then print it. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: output\ninteger :: pos\n\npos = 1\ndo i=1, n\n   if (found) then\n      write(output(pos:), '(I0, A)') 1, ' '\n   else\n      write(output(pos:), '(I0, A)') 2, ' '\n   end if\n   pos = pos + len_trim(output(pos:)) + 1\nend do\nprint *, trim(output)\n\nBut this approach is more complicated, especially handling the dynamic building of the string. Also, the maximum length of the string needs to be sufficient. For example, each number can be up to 3 digits, plus a space, for n up to, say, 1e5. So this approach is not feasible for large n. But since the original code reads n from input, which could be up to any size, this approach is not scalable. Therefore, perhaps better to output each element with a space, and then handle the trailing newline.\n\nAlternatively, after the loop, backspace the last character (the space) and then write a newline. But in Fortran, this is possible using backspace, but it's not straightforward and can be error-prone.\n\nHmm. This is a bit of a problem. Perhaps the original code's trailing space is acceptable, and the Fortran code can proceed with writing each element followed by a space, and then print a newline. Let's proceed with that, and see if the problem expects it.\n\nNow, the rest of the code. Let's outline the code:\n\nProgram structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_421_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, a, b, i, j\n    integer, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:)\n    logical :: found\n\n    read *, n, a, b\n\n    allocate(list1(a))\n    allocate(list2(b))\n\n    read *, (list1(i), i=1, a)\n    read *, (list2(i), i=1, b)\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        found = .false.\n        do j = 1, a\n            if (list1(j) == i) then\n                found = .true.\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (found) then\n            write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') 1, ' '\n        else\n            write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') 2, ' '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Print a newline after the loop\n    print *\n\n    deallocate(list1)\n    deallocate(list2)\nend program codeforces_421_A\n\nWait, but the print * at the end will add a newline. Which the original Java code does not. So the output will have a space followed by a newline. For example, in Java, the output would be \"1 2 1 \" (without a newline), but in Fortran, it's \"1 2 1 \\n\". But perhaps in programming contests, this is acceptable. However, some judges might not like the trailing newline. So this could be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, instead of using print *, after the loop, perhaps write a line with nothing. But how?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, not print the newline. But then, how to ensure that the output is flushed. Because in Fortran, the output is line-buffered. So if the program ends without a newline, the output might not be flushed. To avoid that, perhaps it's better to print the newline. But then the trailing space and newline might be considered a wrong answer. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem allows trailing spaces. Let me look at the problem statement. Well, since the user hasn't provided it, I can't check. But given that the Java code uses the loop to print a space after each number, including the last one, perhaps the problem expects that. So the Fortran code should do the same. \n\nBut in Fortran, how to avoid the trailing newline. For example, using the write statement with advance='no' for all elements, and then not printing anything else. But when the program ends, the output buffer may or may not be flushed. So perhaps the code should call flush. But that's not standard in Fortran 95. Alternatively, let's proceed without the final newline, and see.\n\nWait, the code in Java prints each number followed by a space, and the program ends. In practice, the Java code's output would be a line with n numbers separated by spaces and ending with a space, but without a newline. When the program ends, the output is flushed, and the console displays the line, possibly followed by a shell prompt. But in programming contests, the output is checked exactly. So if the problem expects the output to have the trailing space, then adding a newline would be wrong. \n\nBut how to handle this in Fortran. Let's see. For example, in Fortran, the code can output each element followed by a space, using advance='no', and then nothing else. But then, the line would not have a newline. However, when the program terminates, the output buffer is flushed, and the line is printed as is. But whether that's the case depends on the Fortran runtime. \n\nThis is a tricky part. To make sure that the output doesn't have a newline, perhaps we can use a non-advancing write and then not print anything else. But that's what we are doing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases accept the trailing space and/or newline. In programming contests, sometimes trailing spaces are allowed. So perhaps the code can proceed as written, and the print * at the end is added. But that would add a newline. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, remove the print * at the end. Let's see. In that case, the code would output the numbers followed by spaces, but no newline. But when the program exits, the runtime may automatically add a newline. Which would make the output have a trailing space followed by a newline. \n\nThis is a problem. I think the correct way is to avoid the trailing newline, but in Fortran, it's difficult. \n\nWait, perhaps the code can write the entire line as a single string, without a trailing space. Let me think. For example, first, build an array of characters for each number, then write them all at once. But that's complicated. \n\nAlternatively, use a format that writes all the numbers in a single write statement. But that requires knowing the output in advance, which isn't possible. So for each i from 1 to n, write the number followed by a space, but in the last iteration, omit the space. But how to know when it's the last iteration. \n\nBut since n is read from input, we can loop from 1 to n, and for each i, check if it's the last element. For example:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n   if (i == n) then\n      write(*, '(I0)', advance='no') num\n   else\n      write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') num, ' '\n   end if\nend do\n\nBut this requires knowing whether i is the last element. So in the code:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n   ! ... check found\n   if (found) then\n      num = 1\n   else\n      num = 2\n   end if\n   if (i == n) then\n      write(*, '(I0)', advance='no') num\n   else\n      write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') num, ' '\n   end if\nend do\n\nBut this way, the last element is written without a space. Which would match the original Java code's behavior. Wait, the original Java code's loop is for (int i = 0; i < n; i++), which runs n times. For each iteration, it appends \"1 \" or \"2 \", so after n iterations, there are n spaces. So the output ends with a space. But according to this code, the Fortran code would end with a space only for i < n. Hmm, no. Because in the code above, for i from 1 to n, when i is not the last, we write a space. For the last i, we don't. So the output would be \"1 2 1\" (without the trailing space). But the Java code would output \"1 2 1 \" (with trailing space). So this approach would differ. \n\nSo the original code's output has a trailing space. Therefore, the code needs to output a space after every element, including the last one. Therefore, the Fortran code should output a space after each element, even after the last. Then, the output has a trailing space. \n\nBut then, how to avoid a newline at the end. In Fortran, each write statement with advance='no' appends to the current line. So all the writes are part of the same line. When the program ends, the line is flushed, but whether a newline is added depends on the runtime. \n\nIn some systems, the line will be written as is, without a newline. But others may add a newline. This is not portable. Therefore, this approach might not work. \n\nHmm. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can write all elements in a single formatted write. For example, create a format string that prints all numbers with spaces. But this requires knowing the numbers in advance, which is possible, but would require storing them in an array first. \n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Create an array, say, result(n), where each element is 1 or 2.\n\n2. Populate this array by checking for each i in 1..n.\n\n3. Then, write the array using a format that outputs each element followed by a space, including the last.\n\nBut then, how to format it. For example:\n\nwrite(*, '(*(I0, \" \"))') result\n\nBut this would output each element followed by a space, including the last. Which is what we need. \n\nThen, the problem is the trailing space. However, the format would produce a trailing space, which matches the Java code. \n\nBut does Fortran support this? Let's see. The format (*(I0, \" \")) uses the unlimited format item. For each element in the output list, apply the format (I0, \" \"). So for each element, it would write the number followed by a space. So for n elements, there are n spaces. So the output would be \"1 2 3 \" (for example). \n\nThen, when this is written, the write statement appends a newline. Because in Fortran, each write statement (without advance='no') appends a newline. So the output would have a trailing space and a newline. Which may or may not be acceptable. \n\nBut the original Java code does not have a newline. So this approach would add a newline, which may be incorrect. \n\nHmm. So perhaps this approach is not better. \n\nAlternatively, collect the output into a string, then write it without a trailing space. But this is complicated. \n\nAnother approach: Use a loop and for each element, write the number and a space. Then, after the loop, backspace the output to remove the last space, and write a newline. But in Fortran, this is possible using backspace, but it's not practical. \n\nAlternatively, use non-advancing writes. For example:\n\ndo i=1, n\n   if (found) then\n      write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') 1, ' '\n   else\n      write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') 2, ' '\n   end if\nend do\nwrite(*, *)  ! adds a newline\n\nBut this adds a newline, which is not desired. \n\nAlternatively, the code can output the entire line as a single string. For example, use an internal file:\n\ncharacter(len=2000) :: buffer\ninteger :: pos\n\npos = 1\ndo i=1, n\n   if (found) then\n      write(buffer(pos:), '(I0, A)') 1, ' '\n   else\n      write(buffer(pos:), '(I0, A)') 2, ' '\n   end if\n   pos = pos + len_trim(buffer(pos:)) + 1\nend do\nwrite(*, '(A)') trim(buffer)\n\nBut this approach truncates the buffer if it's longer than 2000, which may not be acceptable for large n. So this is not scalable. \n\nAlternatively, use a dynamic string. But Fortran 95 doesn't have allocatable characters. So this is not possible. \n\nHmm. This is a difficult problem. \n\nGiven that the original code's output has a trailing space and no newline, but in Fortran, it's challenging to replicate that exactly. Perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the original code, write each element followed by a space using advance='no', and then not print a newline. But as mentioned earlier, the Fortran runtime may automatically add a newline when the program terminates. \n\nIn programming contests, judges often allow trailing newlines. For example, if the correct output is \"1 2 3 \", and the code outputs \"1 2 3 \\n\", it's still accepted. So perhaps the code can proceed as written, with the write statements and no final newline. \n\nAlternatively, the problem may not care about the trailing newline. \n\nGiven that, perhaps proceed with the code that writes each element with a space using advance='no', and not add a newline. Then, the code would be as follows.\n\nBut how to handle the advance='no' and ensure that all writes are part of the same line. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe code will read the inputs, check for each i in 1..n, loop through list1 to see if it's present, and output 1 or 2 followed by a space, using advance='no'. \n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\nprogram codeforces_421_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, a, b, i, j, num\n    integer, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:)\n    logical :: found\n\n    read *, n, a, b\n\n    allocate(list1(a))\n    allocate(list2(b))\n\n    read (*, *) list1\n    read (*, *) list2\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        found = .false.\n        do j = 1, a\n            if (list1(j) == i) then\n                found = .true.\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (found) then\n            num = 1\n        else\n            num = 2\n        end if\n        write(*, '(I0, A)', advance='no') num, ' '\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(list1)\n    deallocate(list2)\nend program codeforces_421_A\n\nThis code reads list1 and list2 using list-directed input (read (*, *) list1), which is okay as long as the input is given correctly. Then, for each i from 1 to n, it checks if i is in list1. If so, outputs 1 and a space, else 2 and a space. \n\nThe writes use advance='no', so they all appear on the same line. However, after the loop, there's no newline. But when the program terminates, the Fortran runtime may or may not add a newline. \n\nBut in practice, the code may or may not pass the test cases depending on whether the judge accepts a trailing newline. \n\nAnother possible error is that the code reads list2 but doesn't use it. The Java code reads list2 but doesn't use it. Because in the Java code, the output is 1 if the number is in list1, else 2. So list2 is irrelevant. That's correct. Because the code checks list1, and if not in list1, outputs 2, regardless of list2. So the code is correct. \n\nSo the Fortran code is correct in that aspect. \n\nSo the main issue is the trailing space and newline. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps proceed with this code, which is a direct translation, even if there's a trailing newline. \n\nThus, the final Fortran code is as above."
