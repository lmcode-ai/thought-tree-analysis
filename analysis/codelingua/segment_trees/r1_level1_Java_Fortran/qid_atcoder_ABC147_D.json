So for modulus operations, exponents can be computed efficiently. But in Fortran, perhaps use a loop to compute 2^i mod div. For example:\n\nfactor = 1\n\ndo k = 1, i\n\n    factor = mod(factor * 2, div)\n\nend do But since for each i, the factor is 2^i mod div. So for i=0, it's 1? Wait, no. Wait, when i=0, the original code shifts a left 0 times, which is 1 (since 2^0 is 1). But in the Java code, for i=0, the loop over j from 0 to i-1 (which is -1) doesn't run, so a remains as count1*(n-count1), then multiplied by 1. So factor for i=0 is 1. Then for i=1, factor is 2^1 mod div. So yes, for each i, the factor is 2^i mod div. But wait, in the Java code, for each i, after computing a = count1*(n-count1), then shifts it i times. So the total multiplier is 2^i. For example, i=3: a is multiplied by 8. But in the Java code, for i=3, the loop j runs from 0 to 2 (3 times), shifting left each time. So a is multiplied by 2^3. So in Fortran, the factor is 2^i mod div. So to compute 2^i mod div, perhaps precompute a variable that starts at 1 and for each i, multiply by 2 and mod div. But since i runs from 0 to 59, maybe in the loop over i, we can compute the current power. Wait, but for i=0, the factor is 1 (since 2^0=1). For i=1, 2^1=2. For i=2, 4, etc. So during the loop over i from 0 to 59, the factor is 2^i mod div. So we can compute this factor as a variable that starts at 1 for i=0, then each i, multiply by 2 and mod div.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first to understand what it does. \n\nThe main part seems to be calculating some sum involving the bits of the input numbers. The code reads n numbers into an array A. Then, for each bit position from 0 to 59, it counts how many numbers have that bit set. Then it calculates a value based on the count and accumulates the result into ans, taking modulo 1e9+7 at each step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, I'll need to read the input. The Java code uses a Scanner to read n and then the array elements. In Fortran, I can read using READ statements. Also, variables in Fortran need to be declared with their types. Since Java uses long, which is 64-bit, Fortran's integer kind might need to be 8 bytes. Maybe use integer(8) for variables like a, count1, ans, etc.\n\nThe loop for 60 bits: in Java, i goes from 0 to 59. For each i, it checks the i-th bit of each element in A. In Fortran, to check the bit, I can use the BTEST function. For example, BTEST(A(j), i) returns true if the i-th bit is set. Then count the number of true values.\n\nWait, but in Java, (A[j] >> i & 1) == 1 checks if the bit is set. So in Fortran, for each element A(j), loop through i from 0 to 59. For each i, count how many elements have that bit set. Then compute a as count1 * (n - count1). Then shift a left by i bits, but in Java, they do a loop over j from 0 to i-1, shifting left each time and modding by div. Wait, wait, in Java code:\n\nIn the loop over i (bit position), after computing a = count1 * (n - count1), then for each j from 0 to i-1, a is shifted left by 1 each time, mod div. That's equivalent to shifting a left by i bits, but doing the modulo each step. Because shifting left i times is the same as multiplying by 2^i. So a * (2^i) mod div. But in the Java code, they do it in a loop, shifting left each time and modding. So in Fortran, perhaps compute (a * (2**i)) mod div? But since i can be up to 59, 2**i could be a very large number. So maybe compute the 2^i part using modular exponentiation to avoid overflow.\n\nWait, but in Java, the code is:\n\na = count1 * (n - count1);\n\nthen for each j from 0 to i-1:\n\na = (a << 1) % div;\n\nSo that's effectively a = (a * 2^i) mod div. But since each shift is followed by mod, it's the same as a * 2^i mod div, but calculated step by step. So in Fortran, I can compute this as (a * mod_pow(2, i, div)) mod div. But how to compute mod_pow? Since 2^i mod div can be computed efficiently with exponentiation, but in Fortran, perhaps use a loop to multiply and mod each time.\n\nAlternatively, since 2^i mod div can be precomputed. But let's think: in the Java code, for each bit i, after computing a = count1*(n - count1), they shift a left by i bits, modding div each step. So a is first multiplied by 2^i, but each multiplication by 2 is modded. So the equivalent is (a * pow(2, i)) mod div. But when a is up to n*(n-1) (since count1 can be up to n, so count1*(n - count1) is up to (n^2)/4), and multiplied by 2^i, which is up to 2^59. But n can be up to what? The problem's input constraints aren't given, but in the Java code, A is a long array, so perhaps n is up to 1e5 or similar. So when n is large, 1e5, count1*(n - count1) could be up to 1e10, and multiplied by 2^59 would be way beyond 64-bit integers. So using mod at each step is better. \n\nWait, but in the Java code, a is initially count1 * (n - count1), which is an integer. Then for i times, it shifts left (multiplies by 2) and takes mod each time. So in the end, a is (count1 * (n - count1) ) * (2^i) mod div. But 2^i mod div can be precomputed. Because shifting left i times is multiplying by 2^i. So perhaps compute the power of 2^i modulo div first, then multiply by the initial a, then mod div.\n\nSo the key is that for each i, the contribution is (count1*(n - count1) ) * (2^i) mod div. Then sum all these contributions for each i, modding each time.\n\nBut how to compute 2^i mod div? Since div is 1e9+7. So in Fortran, for each i, compute pow2 = mod(2**i, div). But 2**i could be a very large number when i is 60, but in Fortran, exponentiation might handle it as a real, but that's not precise. So better to compute it with a loop, multiplying by 2 each time and taking mod. So perhaps precompute an array of 2^i mod div for i up to 59.\n\nAlternatively, during the loop for i from 0 to 59, compute the current power of 2^i mod div. Wait, but for each i, 2^i is needed. But for i=0, it's 1, for i=1, 2, etc. So in the loop over i from 0 to 59, perhaps compute the power as mod(shift, div), where shift starts at 1 for i=0, then multiplied by 2 each time.\n\nWait, for each bit position i (from 0 to 59), the number of bits is i+1, but the Java code loops j from 0 to i-1, shifting a left each time. So for i=0, there are 0 shifts (since j from 0 to -1, which doesn't loop). For i=0, a is count1*(n-count1), then multiplied by 2^0 (since 0 shifts) which is 1. So for each i, the shift is i times. Wait, the loop for j in 0..i-1 runs i times. So each j step shifts left once. So total shifts is i steps, which multiplies by 2^i.\n\nSo, for i=0, 2^0=1. For i=5, 2^5. So in Fortran, for each i, we can compute the factor as 2^i mod div, then multiply by a (count1*(n-count1)) and mod div.\n\nSo, for each i:\n\nfactor = 2^i mod div\n\nterm = (count1 * (n - count1)) * factor mod div\n\nthen add term to ans.\n\nBut how to compute 2^i mod div efficiently in Fortran?\n\nSince div is 1e9+7, which is a prime? Let me check: 1e9+7 is 1000000007, which is a known prime. So for modulus operations, exponents can be computed efficiently. But in Fortran, perhaps use a loop to compute 2^i mod div. For example:\n\nfactor = 1\n\ndo k = 1, i\n\n    factor = mod(factor * 2, div)\n\nend do\n\nBut since for each i, the factor is 2^i mod div. So for i=0, it's 1? Wait, no. Wait, when i=0, the original code shifts a left 0 times, which is 1 (since 2^0 is 1). But in the Java code, for i=0, the loop over j from 0 to i-1 (which is -1) doesn't run, so a remains as count1*(n-count1), then multiplied by 1. So factor for i=0 is 1. Then for i=1, factor is 2^1 mod div. So yes, for each i, the factor is 2^i mod div.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, for each i, after computing a = count1*(n-count1), then shifts it i times. So the total multiplier is 2^i. For example, i=3: a is multiplied by 8. But in the Java code, for i=3, the loop j runs from 0 to 2 (3 times), shifting left each time. So a is multiplied by 2^3. So in Fortran, the factor is 2^i mod div.\n\nSo to compute 2^i mod div, perhaps precompute a variable that starts at 1 and for each i, multiply by 2 and mod div. But since i runs from 0 to 59, maybe in the loop over i, we can compute the current power.\n\nWait, but for i=0, the factor is 1 (since 2^0=1). For i=1, 2^1=2. For i=2, 4, etc. So during the loop over i from 0 to 59, the factor is 2^i mod div. So we can compute this factor as a variable that starts at 1 for i=0, then each i, multiply by 2 and mod div. So:\n\nfactor = 1\n\ndo i = 0, 59\n\n    ! compute the term using factor\n\n    ! then update factor for next i (i+1), which is 2^(i+1) mod div\n\n    factor = mod(factor * 2, div)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in this approach, for i=0, factor is 1, which is correct. Then, after handling i=0, factor becomes 2 (for i=1), etc. So during the loop, for each i in 0..59, the current factor is 2^i mod div.\n\nSo that's a good approach. Then, during each iteration, multiply count1*(n-count1) by factor mod div.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nInitialize ans to 0\n\ndiv = 1e9 +7\n\nprecompute factor for each i:\n\nBut wait, in the code, the loop over i from 0 to 59. For each i, compute the number of elements where the i-th bit is set (count1), then compute term = (count1 * (n - count1)) * (2^i mod div) mod div. Then add to ans, mod div.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer(8) :: n, i, j, k, ans, div, count1, a, factor, shift, term\n\n    integer(8), allocatable :: A(:)\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    allocate(A(n))\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) A(i)\n\n    end do\n\n    div = 10**9 +7\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    factor = 1  ! starts at 2^0 =1\n\n    do i = 0, 59\n\n        count1 =0\n\n        do j =1, n\n\n            if (btest(A(j), i)) count1 = count1 +1\n\n        end do\n\n        term = mod( mod(count1 * (n - count1), div) * mod(factor, div)\n\n        term = mod(term, div)\n\n        ans = mod(ans + term, div)\n\n        ! update factor for next i (i+1), which is 2^(i+1) mod div\n\n        factor = mod(factor * 2, div)\n\n    end do\n\n    print *, ans\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in the loop over i from 0 to 59, the factor is 2^i mod div. For example:\n\ni=0: factor=1 (2^0 mod div)\n\ni=1: factor=2 (2^1 mod div)\n\ni=2: factor=4 (2^2 mod div)\n\nBut when i=0, the term is count1*(n-count1) * 1 mod div.\n\nThen, after handling i=0, factor becomes 2 (for i=1). So in the loop, after processing each i, the factor is multiplied by 2 and modded. So the next i's factor is correct.\n\nYes. So the code structure is:\n\nInitialize factor as 1 (for i=0).\n\nLoop i from 0 to 59:\n\n    compute count1 as the number of elements in A where the i-th bit is set.\n\n    term = (count1 * (n - count1)) * factor mod div\n\n    ans += term mod div\n\n    factor = (factor * 2) mod div\n\nBut wait, when factor is updated to (factor * 2) mod div, that's for the next i. So after processing i=0, factor becomes 2 for i=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the bits. In Fortran, the bits are numbered from 0 for the least significant bit. So BTEST(A(j), i) checks the i-th bit. That's the same as the Java code's (A[j] >> i) & 1 ==1.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nn is read as integer(8).\n\nA is an array of integers(8), since in Java they are longs.\n\nBut in Fortran, when using BTEST, the argument must be of type integer. So A should be integer(8), but BTEST works with integers. Wait, Fortran's BTEST function takes an integer and a position. So if A(j) is a 64-bit integer (integer(8)), then BTEST(A(j), i) should correctly check the i-th bit.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In Fortran, array indices start at 1. So in the code, when we read A(j), j runs from 1 to n. The Java code uses 0-based arrays. So that's adjusted.\n\n- When initializing factor as 1 for i=0. Then in the loop over i from 0 to 59.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop is written as do i=0,59. So that's 60 iterations, correct.\n\nTesting the code with sample input:\n\nFor example, if the input is:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\nThen, the Java code would compute:\n\nFor each bit:\n\nBit 0 (1's place):\n\nNumbers are 1 (0b1), 2 (0b10), 3 (0b11). So bits 0:\n\n1: 1, 2:0, 3:1. So count1=2.\n\nterm = 2*(3-2) = 2*1=2. factor is 1. term is 2*1=2 mod 1e9+7. ans +=2.\n\nBit 1 (2's place):\n\nNumbers: 1 (0b01), 2 (0b10),3 (0b11). Bits 1:\n\n0,1,1. count1=2.\n\nterm=2*(3-2)=2. factor is 2. So 2*2=4. ans=2+4=6.\n\nBit 2 (4's place):\n\nAll numbers are 0 here. So count1=0. term is 0* (3-0) *4 (since factor is 4 now). So 0. ans remains 6.\n\nOther bits (3-59): same as term=0. So total ans is 6.\n\nJava code would output 6.\n\nIn Fortran, the code should output the same.\n\nAnother example: perhaps n=2, numbers 1 and 3. Then:\n\nBit 0: both 1 and 1. count1=2. term=2*(2-2)*1=0.\n\nBit1: 0 and 1. count1=1. term=1*(2-1)*2=2. ans=2.\n\nSo sum is 2.\n\nSo code should work.\n\nSo the Fortran code should correctly handle this.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Integer overflow. But variables are declared as integer(8), which is 64-bit. So count1*(n - count1) can be up to (1e5)*(1e5) which is 1e10, which fits in 64-bit integer. Then multiplied by factor (up to 2^59 mod 1e9+7) which is about 5e8. So 1e10 * 5e8 = 5e18, which is larger than 64-bit's maximum (9e18), but when modded by 1e9+7, but in Fortran, the multiplication of two 64-bit integers may overflow. Wait, 1e10 * 5e8 is 5e18, which is less than 9e18 (max of 64-bit signed integer). So that's okay.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the term calculation:\n\nterm = mod( mod(count1 * (n - count1), div) * mod(factor, div)\n\nBut since count1*(n - count1) can be up to n^2/4, which may be up to 1e10 for n=1e5. Then mod(count1*(n - count1), div) is (1e10 mod 1e9+7) which is 9999999993 mod 1e9+7 is 9999999993 -9*(1e9+7) = ?\n\nWait, 1e9+7 is 1000000007. 1e10 is 10,000,000,000.\n\n10,000,000,000 divided by 1e9+7 is 9 times (9*1e9+7=9,000,000,063). Subtract that from 10,000,000,000 gives 999,999,937. So mod is 999,999,937.\n\nThen multiplied by factor (up to 1e9+7-1). So 999,999,937 * (1e9+7-1) is about 1e18, which is manageable in 64-bit integer. Then mod by div.\n\nSo in code:\n\nterm = mod( mod(count1 * (n - count1), div) * mod(factor, div )\n\nBut factor is already modded, since factor is mod(factor *2, div) each step. So mod(factor, div) is redundant. So term can be written as:\n\nterm = mod( count1 * (n - count1), div ) * factor\n\nThen mod that product by div.\n\nSo term = mod( (count1 * (n - count1) mod div ) * factor, div )\n\nSo in code:\n\nterm = mod( count1*(n - count1), div )\n\nterm = mod( term * factor, div )\n\nBut in Fortran, the multiplication may overflow if done directly. For example, (count1*(n - count1) mod div) is up to div-1. Factor is up to div-1. So (div-1)^2 can be up to 1e18, which is within 64-bit integers. So when multiplied, it can fit. Then mod div.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nterm = mod( count1*(n - count1), div )\n\nterm = mod( term * factor, div )\n\nBut in code, it's written as:\n\nterm = mod( mod(count1 * (n - count1), div ) * mod(factor, div ), div )\n\nWhich is same as mod( (mod(a, div) * mod(b, div)), div ), which is the same as mod(a*b, div). So it's redundant. So just compute term = mod( count1*(n - count1) * factor, div )\n\nBut to avoid possible overflow during multiplication, perhaps compute as mod(mod(a, div) * mod(b, div), div). So in code:\n\nterm = mod( mod( count1*(n - count1), div ) * mod( factor, div ), div )\n\nBut factor is already modded in each step, so mod(factor, div) is just factor. So:\n\nterm = mod( (count1*(n - count1) mod div ) * factor, div )\n\nYes.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nterm = mod( mod( count1*(n - count1), div ) * factor, div )\n\nBut in Fortran, the mod function can be applied as:\n\nterm = mod( mod( count1*(n - count1), div ) * factor, div )\n\nBut the order of operations is important. So in Fortran, this would be:\n\nterm = mod( mod( count1 * (n - count1 ), div ) \n\nterm = mod( term * factor, div )\n\nAlternatively, in one line:\n\nterm = mod( mod( count1 * (n - count1 ), div ) * factor\n\nterm = mod( term, div )\n\nBut in code, the line can be written as:\n\nterm = mod( mod(count1 * (n - count1, int8), div) * factor, div )\n\nWait, but Fortran's mod function is mod(a, p). So:\n\nterm = mod( mod( count1*(n - count1), div ) * factor, div )\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when reading the input, the code uses:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(A(n))\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n    read(*,*) A(i)\n\nend do\n\nWhich is correct for reading n elements.\n\nPutting it all together, the Fortran code should look like:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer(8) :: n, i, j, ans, div, count1, factor, term\n\n    integer(8), allocatable :: A(:)\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    allocate(A(n))\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) A(i)\n\n    end do\n\n    div = 10**9 + 7\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    factor = 1\n\n    do i = 0, 59\n\n        count1 = 0\n\n        do j = 1, n\n\n            if (btest(A(j), i)) count1 = count1 + 1\n\n        end do\n\n        term = mod( mod( count1 * (n - count1 ), div ) * factor\n\n        term = mod( term, div )\n\n        ans = mod( ans + term, div )\n\n        factor = mod( factor * 2_8, div )\n\n    end do\n\n    print *, ans\n\nend program\n\nBut wait, in the line factor = mod( factor * 2_8, div ), the 2_8 specifies that 2 is integer(8). That's to avoid possible overflow. But in Fortran, if factor is integer(8), multiplying by 2 (default integer) might promote to higher kind, but better to use 2_8 to ensure 64-bit multiplication.\n\nTesting this code with the example where n=3, A = [1,2,3].\n\nLoop for i=0:\n\ncount1 is number of elements where bit 0 is set.\n\n1 in binary is 1 \u2192 bit 0 is 1.\n\n2 is 10 \u2192 bit 0 is 0.\n\n3 is 11 \u2192 bit 0 is 1. So count1=2.\n\nterm = mod( 2 * 1, div ) * 1 \u2192 2 mod div is 2. term=2*1=2 mod div is 2.\n\nans becomes 2.\n\nfactor becomes 2.\n\ni=1:\n\ncheck bit 1.\n\n1: 0 \u2192 no.\n\n2: 1 \u2192 yes.\n\n3: 1 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount1=2.\n\nterm = mod(2*(3-2), div) * 2 \u2192 mod(2*1, div)=2. 2*2=4 mod div=4.\n\nans=2+4=6 mod div=6.\n\nfactor becomes 4.\n\ni=2:\n\nbit 2 for all elements:\n\n1 is 001 \u2192 no.\n\n2 is 010 \u2192 no.\n\n3 is 011 \u2192 no. So count1=0.\n\nterm=0 \u2192 no change.\n\nSimilarly for higher bits. So ans is 6, which matches the expected result.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother thing to check is the loop over i from 0 to 59. In Fortran, that would be written as do i=0,59. Yes.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
