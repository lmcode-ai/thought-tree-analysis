Since Fortran has logical operations, perhaps:\n\nresult = 0\nif (x /= 1) then\n    result = 1\nend if\n\nAlternatively, using a ternary-like expression. But Fortran doesn't have a ternary operator. So the if statement is straightforward.\n\nThen, print the result. So:\n\nprint *, result\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nWait, let's check the original code's logic again. Let's take examples:\n\nIf x is 1: result is 0.\n\nIf x is 0: result is 1.\n\nIf x is 5: result is 1.\n\nSo the code inverts whether x is 1 or not.\n\nSo in Fortran, the program would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x, result\n    read(*,*) x\n    if (x == 1) then\n        result = 0\n    else\n        result = 1\n    end if\n    print *, result\nend program main\n\nAlternatively, can compute result as 1 - (x == 1). Wait, in Fortran, logical expressions return .true. or .false., which when converted to integers are 1 and 0 (but wait, actually in Fortran, when converting .true. to integer, it's -1 in some compilers, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe not. Let me check. Oh right, in Fortran, the intrinsic function merge can be used. Or perhaps using a mathematical expression.\n\nAlternatively, result = 1 - merge(1, 0, x == 1). Hmm, but maybe it's better to use the if statement for clarity, especially since the original code uses a conditional.\n\nBut since the code is simple, maybe the if statement is the best way.\n\nSo the Fortran code should read x, compute 0 if x is 1, else 1, and print.\n\nYes. So the code would look like that. Also, Fortran programs need to have implicit none, declare variables. So the code structure is as written.\n\nTesting with x=1, output 0. x=0, output 1. Correct.\n\nSo the final Fortran code would be as above."
