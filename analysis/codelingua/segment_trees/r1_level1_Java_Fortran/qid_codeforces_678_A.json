    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the original code does. So the Java program reads two integers, n and k. Then it increments n by 1. After that, if the new n is not divisible by k, it calculates z as k minus the remainder of n divided by k. Finally, it prints n plus z. The goal is to find the smallest multiple of k that is greater than or equal to the incremented n.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to handle input in Fortran. Java uses Scanner, but Fortran uses READ statements. So in Fortran, I'll need to read from standard input. The variables n and k should be integers, so I'll declare them as INTEGER.\n\nNext, the logic after reading the inputs. The Java code does n++ which is equivalent to n = n + 1. Then, check if n mod k is not zero. If so, compute z as k - (n mod k). Otherwise, z is zero. Then output n + z.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the modulus operator is MOD(a, b). So n % k in Java becomes MOD(n, k) in Fortran. Also, the way to compute z is similar. Let's structure that.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read n and k from input.\n2. Increment n by 1.\n3. Calculate the remainder: rem = MOD(n, k)\n4. If rem is not zero, z = k - rem. Else, z = 0.\n5. Then the result is n + z.\n6. Print the result.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, if the remainder is zero, z remains zero. So adding z would just give n, which is already a multiple of k. But wait, when n is incremented by one, n becomes n_initial +1. Then, the code checks if that new n is divisible by k. If not, find the next multiple. So the code is effectively finding the smallest multiple of k that is >= n+1.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula to compute this. The next multiple can be calculated as ((n + k - 1) / k) * k. But maybe the original code is clearer.\n\nBut in the Java code, let's see. Let's take an example. Suppose n=5, k=3. Then n becomes 6. 6 mod 3 is 0, so z is 0. Output is 6. If n=7, k=4. Then n becomes 8. 8 mod 4 is 0, z=0. Output 8. If n=6, k=4. Then n becomes 7. 7 mod 4 is 3. So z is 4-3=1. 7+1=8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct. Now, translating this logic to Fortran.\n\nSo the variables: declare n, k, z as integers.\n\nIn Fortran, reading from standard input can be done with READ(*,*) n, k. Then n = n + 1. Then compute the remainder.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, k, z, remainder\n\n    read(*,*) n, k\n    n = n + 1\n    remainder = mod(n, k)\n    if (remainder /= 0) then\n        z = k - remainder\n    else\n        z = 0\n    end if\n    write(*,*) n + z\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the modulus function returns a result with the same sign as the first argument. For example, mod(7,4) is 3, mod(-7,4) is -3. But in this case, since n and k are positive (assuming the inputs are positive), the remainder will be non-negative. So the code is safe.\n\nBut what if k is zero? Well, the original Java code probably assumes that k is a positive integer, as division by zero would cause a problem. So the Fortran code will have the same behavior if k is zero, which is an error.\n\nSo the code should work as expected. Let me test it with some examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: 5 3\n\nJava code: n becomes 6. 6 mod 3 is 0, z=0. Output 6.\n\nFortran code: same.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nInput: 6 4\n\nJava: n=7. 7 mod4=3. z=1. 7+1=8.\n\nFortran code: same.\n\nAnother test case: n=8, k=4. n becomes 9. mod(9,4)=1. z=3. 9+3=12? Wait, but 9 + 3 is 12, which is 4*3. But 9 is not a multiple of 4. Wait, no. 9 mod4 is 1. So z is 3. 9+3=12. Which is correct. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the translated Fortran code should look like the code above.\n\nI think that's all. Let me write the code as the answer."
