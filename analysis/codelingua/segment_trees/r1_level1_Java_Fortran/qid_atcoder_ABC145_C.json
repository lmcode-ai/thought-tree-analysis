So for example, if N=2, then the pairs (0,1) and (1,0) are both considered. So the total number of pairs is N*(N-1), since for each of the N elements i, there are N-1 j's. So in the sum, each pair is counted twice. But when the code sums all of them, then the average is sum / N. Wait, the Java code's sum is adding all i and j pairs (i and j from 0 to N-1) except when i == j. So the total number of terms is N*(N-1). So the average is sum / N. Wait, why divided by N? Wait, let's see. Let's say N is 2. Then the sum would be dist between 0 and 1 plus dist between 1 and 0. But those are the same distance, so sum is 2*d, and the average is (2d)/2 = d, which is correct. So the division by N is correct here. But for N=3, total pairs would be 3*2 =6. So sum is sum of all 6 distances, but each pair is considered twice. Wait, no. For example, i=0, j=1 and i=1, j=0 are both considered. So the sum is actually 2*(sum of all unique pairs). So when you divide by N, which is 3 in this case, you get (2*sum)/(3). But the average over all possible permutations (i,j) where i ! = j is sum/(N*(N-1)), which would be the average for each ordered pair. But the Java code's output is sum divided by N. Hmm, perhaps the original problem's requirement is to compute the average over all possible paths, including both directions.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nSo, the program reads an integer N from input, then reads N pairs of integers representing coordinates. Then it calculates the sum of the distances between all pairs of points (excluding when i equals j) and finally divides that sum by N to get the average, which is printed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to structure the Fortran code. In Java, they use a 2D array for the positions. In Fortran, I can use a 2D array as well. Let's see, maybe allocate it as pos(N, 2), since in Fortran the dimensions are row-major, I think. Or wait, maybe it's better to have each coordinate as a row. Wait, in Java, pos[i][0] is the x-coordinate of the i-th point. So in Fortran, if I have pos(N, 2), then pos(i, 1) would be x, pos(i,2) y. That's manageable.\n\nNext, reading the input. In Java, they use a Scanner. In Fortran, I can read using READ statements. So first read N, then loop from 1 to N and read pos(i,1) and pos(i,2).\n\nThen, the sum calculation. The Java code loops through all i and j, but skips when i==j. So for each i, j pair where i != j, compute the distance and add to sum. In Fortran, I'll need to do a similar double loop. So i from 1 to N, j from 1 to N, and if i /= j, compute the distance and accumulate the sum.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when i and j are all possible pairs, including (i,j) and (j,i), because both loops go from 0 to N-1. So for example, if N=2, then the pairs (0,1) and (1,0) are both considered. So the total number of pairs is N*(N-1), since for each of the N elements i, there are N-1 j's. So in the sum, each pair is counted twice. But when the code sums all of them, then the average is sum / N. Wait, the Java code's sum is adding all i and j pairs (i and j from 0 to N-1) except when i == j. So the total number of terms is N*(N-1). So the average is sum / N. Wait, why divided by N?\n\nWait, let's see. Let's say N is 2. Then the sum would be dist between 0 and 1 plus dist between 1 and 0. But those are the same distance, so sum is 2*d, and the average is (2d)/2 = d, which is correct. So the division by N is correct here. But for N=3, total pairs would be 3*2 =6. So sum is sum of all 6 distances, but each pair is considered twice. Wait, no. For example, i=0, j=1 and i=1, j=0 are both considered. So the sum is actually 2*(sum of all unique pairs). So when you divide by N, which is 3 in this case, you get (2*sum)/(3). But the average over all possible permutations (i,j) where i != j is sum/(N*(N-1)), which would be the average for each ordered pair. But the Java code's output is sum divided by N. Hmm, perhaps the original problem's requirement is to compute the average over all possible paths, including both directions. For example, in the case of traveling through all permutations of points, but the problem might have a specific requirement. But regardless, the task is to translate the code as is.\n\nSo, the Fortran code needs to replicate this exactly.\n\nNow, the steps for Fortran:\n\n1. Read N.\n\n2. Read N pairs of integers into an array.\n\n3. Compute the sum of distances between all ordered pairs (i,j) where i != j.\n\n4. Divide the sum by N and print the result.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the structure would be:\n\nProgram definition, variable declarations, then the code.\n\nVariables: N, pos array, sum (which should be a real number), etc.\n\nFirst, Fortran is case-insensitive, but usually written in uppercase for keywords. But code can be in lower case if preferred.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, j\n    integer, allocatable :: pos(:,:)\n    real :: sum, distance\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(pos(n, 2))\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) pos(i, 1), pos(i, 2)\n    end do\n    sum = 0.0\n    do i = 1, n\n        do j = 1, n\n            if (i == j) cycle\n            sum = sum + sqrt(real( (pos(i,1) - pos(j,1))**2 + (pos(i,2) - pos(j,2))**2 ))\n        end do\n    end do\n    print *, sum / n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Java, the positions are stored as integers. The distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of differences, but since the inputs are integers, the result could be a real number.\n\nIn Fortran, when subtracting integers, the result is integer. So when squaring, (pos(i,1) - pos(j,1)) is integer, squared gives integer. So their sum is integer, but when passed to sqrt, it needs to be a real. So in Fortran, the sqrt function requires a real argument. So perhaps we need to convert the sum to real.\n\nSo (pos(i,1) - pos(j,1)) is an integer. So (pos(i,1) - pos(j,1))**2 is integer. Similarly for the y component. So when adding them, the sum is integer. So to convert to real, maybe use real(...). So the distance calculation would be:\n\nsqrt( real( (x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2 ) )\n\nYes. So in the code above, inside the loop, we compute (pos(i,1)-pos(j,1))**2 and same for the y part, sum them, convert to real, then take the square root.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cast each term to real first. But I think the way above is correct.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the ** operator for integers is allowed, but the result is integer. So if we have (x1 - x2) as integer, squared is integer, same for y. Their sum is integer. Then real(...) converts that sum to real. Then sqrt(real(...)) gives the correct real distance.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the sqrt function can take a real argument. So this should work.\n\nNow, variable declarations. The sum is a real variable, initialized to 0.0.\n\nThe pos array is allocated as (n,2), read in a loop for each i from 1 to n.\n\nThe loops for i and j go from 1 to n. In Java, the indices start at 0, but in Fortran, we start at 1, but since the loops are from 1 to n, that's correct.\n\nThen, when i equals j, we cycle (like continue in Java).\n\nThen accumulate the sum.\n\nFinally, print sum / n.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the sum is divided by N. So the Fortran code does the same.\n\nSo that's the structure.\n\nTesting this code with sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\n3\n0 0\n1 0\n0 1\n\nJava code computes sum as follows:\n\nEach pair (i,j) where i != j.\n\nFor 3 points, there are 3*2=6 terms.\n\nThe distances between (0,0) and (1,0) is 1.0.\n\nThen (0,0) to (0,1) is 1.0.\n\nThen (0,0) to (0,0) (skipped).\n\nThen (1,0) to (0,0) (distance 1.0), (1,0) to (0,1) (distance sqrt(2)), (1,0) to (1,0) skipped.\n\nThen (0,1) to (0,0) (1.0), (0,1) to (1,0) (sqrt(2)), (0,1) to (0,1) skipped.\n\nSo sum is 1 + 1 + 1 + sqrt(2) + 1 + sqrt(2) = 4 + 2*sqrt(2). \n\nDivide by 3: (4 + 2*1.4142)/3 \u2248 (4 + 2.8284)/3 \u2248 6.8284/3 \u2248 2.2761.\n\nJava code would output that.\n\nIn the Fortran code, same steps. So the code should compute correctly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Allocation of pos array. In Fortran, when you read, each read statement should read a line. So for each pos(i,1) and pos(i,2), the input must be two integers per line. So the input should be as per the Java code.\n\nAnother possible issue is integer division, but in the distance calculation, since the sum is converted to real before taking sqrt, that's okay.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, writing the Fortran code accordingly."
