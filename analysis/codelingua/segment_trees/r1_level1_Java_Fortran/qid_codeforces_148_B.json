    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. So the program reads some input values: VP, VD, T, F, C. Then checks if VD is less than or equal to VP. If so, it outputs 0 and exits. Otherwise, it calculates how many times the dragon catches the princess, incrementing the answer each time, and finally prints the answer.\n\nFirst, let me think about the structure in Fortran. Fortran uses program blocks, variable declarations, and has different input/output handling. Since Fortran is case-insensitive, I'll need to adjust variable names accordingly, but maybe just keep them uppercase for clarity.\n\nThe variables in Java are doubles, so in Fortran, I'll use REAL or DOUBLE PRECISION. Let's see. The inputs are integers according to the Java code (in.nextInt()), but stored as doubles. Wait, Java's nextInt() reads an integer, but then assigns it to a double variable. So in Fortran, I should read them as integers and convert to real? Or read as real numbers directly? Hmm. Let me check. The Java code uses VP, VD, etc., as doubles, but the input is via nextInt(), so they are integers. So in Fortran, perhaps read them as integers and convert to real. Or maybe read as real numbers if possible. For example, if the inputs are 5, 4, etc., reading them as real would be okay. But maybe in Fortran, the user inputs as integers, and the code converts them to real. Let's see.\n\nSo the Fortran code will start with reading the input values. In Java, the inputs are read as integers but stored as doubles. So in Fortran, perhaps we can read them as real variables. Let's use REAL variables for VP, VD, T, F, C. Then check if VD <= VP, then output 0. Else proceed.\n\nThen, the loop. The Java code uses a while(true) loop, which in Fortran would be a DO loop with an exit condition. The variables start and answer are initialized. The calculation of x is start * VP / (VD - VP). Then check if (start + x)*VP >= C, if yes, break. Otherwise, add 2x + F to start, increment answer.\n\nSo translating that step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the inputs: VP, VD, T, F, C. All real numbers? Wait, in Java, they are read as integers but stored as doubles. So in Fortran, maybe read them as integers and then convert to real. Or read as real numbers directly. For example, if the inputs are integers, reading as real is okay. So maybe in Fortran, read using a real format.\n\nBut in Fortran, variables are typed. So declare them as REAL. Then read using, say, read *, VP, VD, T, F, C. But since Java's code is using integers for input, perhaps in Fortran, the inputs are integers but stored as real. Wait, for example, if VP is 10, then in Java, VP is 10.0. So in Fortran, if I read them as real, and the user enters integers, it's the same.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, the variables VP, VD, T, F, C will be REAL. The input will be read as real numbers.\n\nBut the original Java code uses nextInt() to read them. So the inputs are integer values, but stored as doubles. So in Fortran, perhaps read them as integers and convert to real. Wait, but in Fortran, if you read a real variable and input an integer, it's allowed. So maybe just read them as real. So the user can input integers or real numbers, but according to the problem statement, perhaps the inputs are integers. So the Fortran code can read them as real variables.\n\nSo first, the variable declarations:\n\nREAL :: VP, VD, T, F, C\nREAL :: start, x\nINTEGER :: answer\n\nThen read the input:\n\nREAD(*,*) VP, VD, T, F, C\n\nThen check if VD <= VP. If so, print 0 and stop.\n\nIF (VD <= VP) THEN\n    PRINT *, '0'\n    STOP\nEND IF\n\nThen initialize answer to 0 and start to T.\n\nanswer = 0\nstart = T\n\nThen the loop. In Fortran, it's a DO loop with an exit condition.\n\nDO WHILE (.TRUE.)\n    compute x = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n    check if (start + x) * VP >= C\n    if yes, exit\n    else, start = start + 2*x + F\n    answer = answer +1\nEND DO\n\nWait, but how to break the loop. In Fortran, we can use EXIT to break out of the loop.\n\nSo inside the loop:\n\nx = start * VP / (VD - VP)\nIF ( (start + x) * VP >= C ) THEN\n    EXIT\nEND IF\nstart = start + 2*x + F\nanswer = answer +1\n\nSo putting that into a loop. Since the loop is infinite until the EXIT, the DO loop can be DO ... END DO with an EXIT condition.\n\nSo the loop structure:\n\nDO\n    x = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n    IF ( (start + x) * VP >= C ) EXIT\n    start = start + 2 * x + F\n    answer = answer + 1\nEND DO\n\nYes.\n\nThen after the loop, print the answer.\n\nPRINT *, answer\n\nBut wait, in Java, the code checks if (start +x)*VP >= C. Let me recheck the Java code:\n\nIn Java:\n\nif ((start + x) * VP >= C) {\n    break;\n}\n\nYes. So in Fortran, the same condition.\n\nNow, variable types. Since in Java, they are doubles, in Fortran, using REAL may have less precision. So perhaps use DOUBLE PRECISION. Let's use DOUBLE PRECISION variables to match Java's double.\n\nSo changing variable declarations to:\n\nDOUBLE PRECISION :: VP, VD, T, F, C, start, x\nINTEGER :: answer\n\nThen read as:\n\nREAD(*,*) VP, VD, T, F, C\n\nBut when reading into double precision variables, the input should be in the correct format. But assuming that the user inputs integers, like 100 10 10 10 1000, the code would read them correctly as double precision.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_148_B\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    DOUBLE PRECISION :: VP, VD, T, F, C, start, x\n    INTEGER :: answer\n\n    READ(*,*) VP, VD, T, F, C\n\n    IF (VD <= VP) THEN\n        PRINT *, 0\n        STOP\n    END IF\n\n    answer = 0\n    start = T\n\n    DO\n        x = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n        IF ( (start + x) * VP >= C ) EXIT\n        start = start + 2 * x + F\n        answer = answer + 1\n    END DO\n\n    PRINT *, answer\nEND PROGRAM codeforces_148_B\n\nWait, but in Java, the calculation for x is start * VP / (VD - VP). Since VD and VP are doubles. Then in Fortran, the same.\n\nLet me test with sample input. For example, the first sample input from codeforces problem 148 B:\n\nSample Input 1:\n100 10 10 10 1000\n\nBut wait, in Java code, if VD=10, VP=100, then VD <= VP is true. So output is 0.\n\nBut sample input 1's output is 10 according to the problem statement. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the problem wrong. Oh no, maybe the sample inputs I need to check. But perhaps the code is correct as per the translation.\n\nBut let me think: when VD > VP, then the code proceeds. So for example, if VP is 10, VD is 100, which is VD>VP.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the condition is if (VD <= VP) { output 0 }, else proceed. So in Fortran, the same condition.\n\nSo the code should work as per the original logic.\n\nNow, possible issues: division by zero? If VD equals VP, but in the code, that's checked before the loop. So in the loop, VD is guaranteed to be greater than VP. So VD - VP is positive, no division by zero.\n\nSo the Fortran code should be correct.\n\nAnother point: Fortran's operator precedence. The calculation in x is start multiplied by VP, divided by (VD - VP). So same as Java.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work."
