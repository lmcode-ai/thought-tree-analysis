    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. The program reads an integer x from the input. If x is even and not 2, it increments x by 1 to make it odd. Then it checks if x is a prime number by testing divisibility starting from 3 up to the square root of x, stepping by 2. If it's not prime, x increases by 2 and the process repeats until a prime is found. Finally, it prints x.\n\nNow, let's think about the Fortran equivalent. First, Fortran uses different syntax for input/output and loops. The main steps are:\n\n1. Reading the integer x.\n2. Adjusting x if it's even and not 2.\n3. Entering a loop to check for primes.\n4. For each x, check divisibility up to sqrt(x).\n5. If prime, exit loop; else, increment x by 2.\n6. Print the result.\n\nLet's tackle each part step by step.\n\nIn Java, they use Scanner to read input. In Fortran, I'll use READ(*,*) x to get the integer.\n\nThe initial check: if x is even (x mod 2 ==0) and x !=2, then x becomes x+1. In Fortran, that's straightforward with an IF statement.\n\nThen the while(true) loop in Java becomes a DO loop with an exit condition. The loop will continue until a prime is found. The prime checking involves iterating from 3 to sqrt(x) (converted to integer), stepping by 2. For each i, check if x is divisible by i. If any divisor is found, break out of the loop. If after checking all i up to sqrt(x), no divisors are found, then x is prime.\n\nIn Fortran, computing the square root can be done with SQRT, but we need to convert it to an integer. Maybe use INT(SQRT(REAL(x))). Wait, but in Java, Math.sqrt returns a double, and the loop runs while i <= sqrtNum. So in Fortran, the loop variable i should go up to the integer part of sqrt(x). Let me think. For example, if x is 25, sqrt is 5, so i goes up to 5. So in Fortran, the upper limit is INT(SQRT(REAL(x))) maybe. Or maybe using NINT (nearest integer) to avoid issues with floating point precision. Hmm, but in Java, when you cast a double to int, it truncates. So in Fortran, using INT(SQRT(REAL(x))) should be equivalent.\n\nSo inside the loop, for i from 3 to sqrt_x, step 2. Then check if x mod i is zero. If any i divides x, then x is not prime. So in Fortran, we can loop i from 3 to sqrt_x, step 2. But Fortran's DO loop can step by 2 with DO i = 3, sqrt_x, 2. Wait, but the step in Fortran is the third parameter. So yes.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the for loop is for (i =3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2). So in Fortran, the loop would start at 3 and end at sqrt_num, stepping by 2. So the DO loop in Fortran would be DO i =3, sqrt_num, 2. However, we need to make sure that sqrt_num is computed as the integer part. So first compute sqrt_num as INT(SQRT(REAL(x))).\n\nBut in Java, sqrtNum is a double. For example, if x is 11, sqrt is about 3.316, so i runs up to 3. So the loop runs i=3, and then stops. So in Fortran, the upper limit for i should be the integer part of sqrt(x). So that's correct.\n\nOnce the loop completes, check if i exceeds sqrt_num. If yes, then x is prime, break out of the main loop. Otherwise, increment x by 2 and repeat.\n\nIn Fortran, after the loop over i, if the loop didn't find any divisor, then the loop will exit normally. Wait, but in Java, if a divisor is found, the loop breaks early. So in Fortran, we need to check whether the loop completed all iterations or broke early. How to do that?\n\nIn Fortran, after the loop, we can check if the loop variable i is greater than sqrt_num. But in Fortran, the loop variable's value after the loop is not always well-defined. Hmm. So perhaps use a flag variable. Like, have a logical variable is_prime. Initialize it to .true.. Then, inside the loop over i, if x mod i is zero, set is_prime to .false. and exit the loop. Then check is_prime.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\nCompute sqrt_num = INT(SQRT(REAL(x)))\nInitialize is_prime = .true.\nDO i =3, sqrt_num, 2\n   IF (MOD(x, i) ==0) THEN\n       is_prime = .false.\n       EXIT\n   END IF\nEND DO\nIF (is_prime) THEN\n   exit the main loop\nELSE\n   x = x +2\nEND IF\n\nThat's a better approach. Because in Java, the loop breaks as soon as a divisor is found, so the flag approach would replicate that.\n\nSo putting this all together.\n\nThe main loop structure in Fortran would be:\n\nDO\n   compute sqrt_num\n   check if x is prime\n   if prime, exit loop\n   else x +=2\nEND DO\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nFirst, variable declarations. x is integer. Also, i, sqrt_num are integers. is_prime is logical.\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared. So:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x, i, sqrt_num\n    logical :: is_prime\n\n    read(*,*) x\n\n    if (mod(x, 2) == 0 .and. x /= 2) then\n        x = x +1\n    end if\n\n    do\n        sqrt_num = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n        is_prime = .true.\n        do i =3, sqrt_num, 2\n            if (mod(x, i) ==0) then\n                is_prime = .false.\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (is_prime) exit\n        x = x +2\n    end do\n\n    print *, x\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but what about x=2? The initial condition skips if x is 2. So if x is 2, then the initial if is not executed. Then in the loop, sqrt_num would be 1 (sqrt(2)=1.414..., int gives 1). The loop i=3 to 1 with step 2 would not run. So is_prime remains .true., so exit loop and print 2. That's correct.\n\nAnother test case: x=4. Initial x becomes 5. Check if 5 is prime. sqrt(5)=~2.236, int is 2. The loop i=3 to 2, which doesn't run. So is_prime is true. So 5 is printed. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: x=9. Since 9 is odd, initial x remains 9. Check if prime. sqrt(9)=3. The loop i=3. 9 mod 3=0, so is_prime is false. Then x becomes 11. Check 11: sqrt is ~3.316, int 3. loop i=3. 11 mod 3 is 2, so loop ends. is_prime is true. So print 11. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Fortran, when the DO loop's start is larger than end when step is positive, the loop doesn't execute. So for x=3, sqrt_num is 1. So i runs from 3 to 1, step 2. Loop doesn't execute. is_prime remains .true. So 3 is printed. Correct.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nI think that's the correct translation."
