    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. The code reads two integers, h and a, from the input. Then it repeatedly subtracts a from h until h is zero or negative, counting how many times it does this. Finally, it prints the count.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read the two integers. Java uses BufferedReader to read lines, but Fortran can read from standard input using read statements. Let's see.\n\nFirst, declare variables. The Java code uses integers h, a, and num. In Fortran, I'll declare them as integer variables. Maybe like integer :: h, a, num.\n\nNext, reading the input. The Java code splits the input line into strings and parses them. In Fortran, I can read the two integers directly. So perhaps read(*,*) h, a. That should work if the input is given as two space-separated integers on one line.\n\nThen, initialize num to 0. Then loop: as long as h is greater than 0, subtract a from h and increment num. Wait, but the Java loop is a for loop with i, but the loop condition is h > 0. The loop runs as long as h is positive. The for loop increments i, but it's not used. So in Fortran, a do loop might not be the best. Instead, a do while loop would work better.\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 1; h > 0; i++) {\n    h = h - a;\n    num++;\n}\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\nwhile (h > 0) {\n    h -= a;\n    num++;\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, we can use a do while loop. So:\n\nnum = 0\ndo while (h > 0)\n    h = h - a\n    num = num + 1\nend do\n\nThen, after the loop, print num.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: h, a, num\n\n    read(*,*) h, a\n    num = 0\n\n    do while (h > 0)\n        h = h - a\n        num = num + 1\n    end do\n\n    print *, num\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when reading from input, if the line is split into two integers, read(*,*) h, a will handle that. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in Java, the code is h = h - a; which is equivalent to subtracting a each time. Then incrementing the count. The loop continues as long as h is greater than zero. So even if after subtracting a, h becomes zero or negative, the loop ends. So the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nTesting with sample input. For example, if h is 10 and a is 4: first iteration subtract 4 \u2192 6, num=1. Next subtract 4 \u2192 2, num=2. Next subtract 4 \u2192 -2, num=3. Then loop condition h>0 (now -2) is false. So output 3. Which is correct.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nI need to make sure that the variables are properly declared. Also, Fortran is case-insensitive, but using lowercase is standard.\n\nSo the code should look like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC153_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: h, a, num\n\n    read(*, *) h, a\n    num = 0\n\n    do while (h > 0)\n        h = h - a\n        num = num + 1\n    end do\n\n    print *, num\nend program atcoder_ABC153_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the program can be named, but the name is optional. But the original Java code has a public class named atcoder_ABC153_A, so the Fortran program could have the same name. So yes.\n\nI think that's all. Let me check for syntax errors. The do while loop in Fortran uses do while (condition), and the loop ends with end do. Yes. The read statement uses read(*, *) h, a. The print statement uses print *, num. The variables are integers. So this should work."
