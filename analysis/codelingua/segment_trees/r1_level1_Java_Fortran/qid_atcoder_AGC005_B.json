Wait, but the Java code when processing the left pass (right to left), for elements remaining in the stack after the loop, sets leftl[ind] = ind - index -1, and index is -1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads an array of integers and then calculates for each element the number of consecutive elements to the left and right that are greater than the current element. Then, it uses these values to compute a sum, which is the product of the element, the left count plus one, and the right count plus one. The main data structure used here is a deque (ArrayDeque) to keep track of indices in a way similar to a monotonic stack, which helps in finding the next smaller elements on both sides.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to replicate the deque functionality in Fortran. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in deque or stack structure, I'll have to implement it using arrays and manage the indices manually. Let's see.\n\nIn the Java code, there are two passes: one from left to right to compute rightl (the right lengths) and another from right to left to compute leftl. Each time, elements are popped from the deque when a smaller element is found, which determines how far the current element can extend to the left or right.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each part:\n\n1. Read N and the array a.\n2. Initialize leftl and rightl arrays.\n3. Process the array from left to right using a stack (deque) to compute rightl.\n4. Process the array from right to left using the stack again to compute leftl.\n5. Compute the sum ans by iterating over each element.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with reading input. In Java, they use Scanner to read N and the array. In Fortran, we'll read from standard input. For that, I can use READ(*,*) statements.\n\nNext, the deque. For the left to right pass, the deque stores indices in a way that their corresponding a values are in increasing order. When a new element is processed, elements in the deque with a higher value are popped, and their rightl is calculated.\n\nIn Fortran, I can simulate the deque with an array and a pointer (like a top index). For example, que could be an array of integers, and we'll manage it as a stack. When pushing, we add to the top, and when popping, we take from the top. Wait, but the Java code uses a deque where push adds to the front (like a stack). Oh right, because when they process elements, they push to the front of the deque, and pop from the front. So in the Java code, the deque is used as a stack.\n\nSo for the Fortran version, each stack can be represented by an array and a variable tracking the current size. For example, for the first pass:\n\nInitialize que as an array, say, size N (since in the worst case, all elements are pushed). The stack pointer starts at 0. When we push an index, we increment the pointer and assign the index. When we pop, we take the top element (que(stack_ptr)) and decrement the pointer.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, que is a stack. For example, in the first loop:\n\nindex starts at 0. While index < N, we check if the deque is not empty and the a[que.peek()] (top element) is greater than a[index]. Then, we pop the top (que.poll()), which removes the first element of the deque. Wait, ArrayDeque's poll() removes the first element (head), but when you push with push(), it adds to the front. So the deque is acting as a stack: LIFO. So que is a stack, where push adds to the front, and poll() removes the front (so like a stack's pop).\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the stack can be represented with an array and a top index. Each time, when processing elements, the top is the last element added.\n\nSo, for each pass:\n\nLeft to right pass:\n\nInitialize the stack (que) as empty. index starts at 0. For each element a[index], we check the stack's top elements. If the top element's a value is larger than current a[index], then we pop it, compute its rightl as (index - ind -1). Then push the current index into the stack. Repeat until all elements are processed. Then, any remaining elements in the stack have their rightl set to N - ind - 1.\n\nSimilarly for the right to left pass, but index starts at N-1 and goes down to 0. For each a[index], check the stack's top elements. If the top's a is larger than current, pop and compute leftl as (ind - index -1). Then push current index. After processing all, remaining elements have leftl set to ind - (-1) -1? Wait, the original Java code in the left pass after processing, the remaining elements' rightl is set to N - ind -1. For the left pass, after processing from right to left, the remaining elements' leftl is set to ind - index -1. But in the code, after the loop, index is -1 (since after the loop, index-- would make it go to -1 if started at 0 and decremented). Wait, let me look again.\n\nIn the Java code for the leftl calculation:\n\nAfter processing elements from right to left (index starts at N-1 and decreases), the code:\n\nwhile (index >=0) { ... index-- }\n\nAfter the loop, when the stack is not empty, each element's leftl is set to ind - index -1. But at that point, index is -1 (since the loop exits when index becomes -1). So for those elements, leftl[ind] = ind - (-1) -1 = ind +1 -1 = ind. Wait, that's not right.\n\nWait, let's check the Java code again. \n\nIn the second loop (after processing the left to right pass), the code does:\n\nindex = N -1;\nwhile (index >=0) {\n    while (!que.isEmpty() && a[que.peek()] > a[index]) {\n        int ind = que.poll();\n        leftl[ind] = ind - index -1;\n    }\n    que.push(index--);\n}\nwhile (!que.isEmpty()) {\n    int ind = que.poll();\n    leftl[ind] = ind - index -1;\n}\n\nWait, after the loop, index is -1. So for the remaining elements in the stack, leftl[ind] = ind - (-1) -1 = ind +1 -1 = ind. That seems correct? Or maybe not. Let me think. \n\nThe elements in the stack after processing all elements (index has gone from N-1 down to 0 and then exits). Wait, no. The loop is while (index >=0). So when index is 0, after processing, index becomes -1. Then the loop exits. Then, in the remaining elements in the stack, their leftl is set to ind - (-1) -1 = ind +1 -1 = ind. That would mean that there are no elements to the left, so the left length is ind (the index of the element itself?), which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the logic.\n\nWait, the leftl array for each element is supposed to be the number of consecutive elements to the left that are larger than the current element. So for elements that have no smaller elements to the left, the leftl would extend all the way to the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps the Java code uses a similar approach to the first pass. Let's see:\n\nIn the rightl pass (left to right), after processing all elements, any elements left in the stack are those for which all elements to their right are larger. So their rightl is N - ind -1, which is the distance from their index to the end.\n\nSimilarly, in the leftl pass (right to left), any elements left in the stack have all elements to their left (i.e., to the right in the array since we're processing backward) larger than them, so the leftl is ind - 0 +1? Wait, maybe the logic is that for elements remaining in the stack after processing, there is no smaller element to their left (since we're processing right to left), so the leftl would be their index (since they can extend all the way to the left). \n\nBut the code sets leftl[ind] = ind - index -1. Since index is -1 after the loop, this becomes ind - (-1) -1 = ind. So leftl is set to ind. For example, if the element is at index 0, leftl[0] would be 0. But the leftl is supposed to be the number of elements to the left that are larger. Wait, no. The leftl is the number of elements to the left (so to the left in the array, i.e., lower indices) that are greater than the current element. For example, if an element is the smallest in the entire array, then leftl[i] would be i (since all elements to the left are larger). Similarly, rightl[i] would be (N - i -1).\n\nSo in the case where after processing all elements from right to left, the elements left in the stack are those for which no elements to their left (i.e., elements processed after them, which are to the left in the array) are smaller. So their leftl should be their index (i), because all elements to the left (from 0 to i-1) are larger than a[i]. \n\nWait, but the Java code when processing the left pass (right to left), for elements remaining in the stack after the loop, sets leftl[ind] = ind - index -1, and index is -1. So leftl[ind] becomes ind - (-1) -1 = ind. So that's correct. Because those elements have no smaller elements to their left (since we processed all elements and none caused them to be popped), so the leftl is the number of elements to the left of ind which are all larger. So the count is ind elements (since indices 0 to ind-1 are to the left). So leftl is (ind) elements, but in the code, leftl is stored as ind - index -1. Since index is -1, that's ind +1 -1 = ind. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the Java code's logic for leftl and rightl is correct.\n\nNow, the Fortran code needs to replicate this logic. Let's outline the steps.\n\nFirst, read N and array a.\n\nThen, initialize leftl and rightl arrays.\n\nFor the rightl processing:\n\nInitialize a stack (array and a top pointer). For each index from 0 to N-1:\n\nWhile stack is not empty and a[stack(top)] > a[index], pop the top, set its rightl as (current index - popped index -1). Then push current index.\n\nAfter processing all elements, any remaining in the stack have their rightl set to N - index -1.\n\nSame logic for leftl, processing from N-1 down to 0. For each index:\n\nWhile stack is not empty and a[stack(top)] > a[index], pop the top, set leftl[popped index] to (popped index - current index -1). Then push current index.\n\nAfter processing all, remaining elements have leftl set to popped index - (-1) -1 = popped index.\n\nSo in Fortran, the stack can be represented as an array, and a variable tracking the stack size. Let's say stack is an array of integers (dimension N), and stack_size is an integer. When pushing, we increment stack_size and assign the index. When popping, we take the top element (stack(stack_size)), use it, then decrement stack_size.\n\nNow, translating each part.\n\nReading input: Fortran uses READ(*,*) N, then allocate a, leftl, rightl. Wait, but in Fortran, you can pre-allocate with a fixed size. Since N can be up to what? The original code reads N, then creates a[N], so in Fortran, we can read N, then read N elements into a array.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: N\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), leftl(:), rightl(:)\nread(*,*) N\nallocate(a(N), leftl(N), rightl(N))\ndo i = 1, N\n    read(*,*) a(i)\nend do\n\nWait, but Java uses 0-based indices, Fortran uses 1-based by default. So need to adjust. Or perhaps in Fortran, it's easier to use 1-based arrays, but the code logic can be adjusted. Alternatively, use 0-based arrays in Fortran. Let me think.\n\nIn the Java code, a is 0-based. So for the first element, index 0. The code processes from 0 to N-1.\n\nIn Fortran, if I use 1-based, then the array indices go from 1 to N. So when translating, the code will have indices starting at 1. So the code logic would need to adjust. For example, in the first loop, index starts at 1, up to N. But this might complicate the stack processing. Alternatively, perhaps using 0-based arrays. Fortran allows specifying the lower bound of arrays. For example:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: a, leftl, rightl\n\nBut when N is read from input, in Fortran, we have to allocate them. Wait, but in Fortran, the array dimensions must be specified at compile time unless they are allocatable. So perhaps:\n\ninteger :: N\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), leftl(:), rightl(:)\nread(*,*) N\nallocate(a(0:N-1), leftl(0:N-1), rightl(0:N-1))\ndo i = 0, N-1\n    read(*,*) a(i)\nend do\n\nYes, that's possible. Then, the rest of the code can use 0-based indices, similar to Java. That might make the translation easier.\n\nSo, the first part is reading N and the array a with 0-based indices.\n\nNext, processing rightl:\n\nInitialize the stack. Let's create a stack array and a stack_size variable. Let's have stack(0:N-1) as the stack can't exceed N elements. Stack_size starts at 0.\n\nThen, index starts at 0 (0-based) and increments up to N-1.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: stack(0:N-1)  ! assuming N is known now\ninteger :: stack_size\ninteger :: index, ind\n\nstack_size = 0\nindex = 0\ndo while (index < N)\n    do while (stack_size > 0 .and. a(stack(stack_size-1)) > a(index))\n        ! pop from stack\n        ind = stack(stack_size-1)\n        stack_size = stack_size - 1\n        rightl(ind) = index - ind - 1\n    end do\n    ! push index\n    stack(stack_size) = index\n    stack_size = stack_size + 1\n    index = index + 1\nend do\n\nWait, Fortran uses 1-based indices for arrays by default. Wait, no, if I declared the stack as 0:N-1, then stack(0) is the first element. But in Fortran, if I have a variable stack_size, then stack_size points to the next available position. For example, when stack_size is 0, the stack is empty. When pushing, we assign stack(stack_size) = index, then increment stack_size. So the stack elements are in 0 to stack_size-1. So when stack_size is 0, the stack is empty.\n\nSo when the stack is not empty, the top element is stack(stack_size - 1).\n\nIn the Java code, the deque is processed as a stack. So when pushing, the element is added to the front of the deque. So the top of the stack is the last added element. Hence, the Fortran stack as above.\n\nAfter processing all elements, there might be elements left in the stack. For each of them, set rightl[ind] = N - ind -1.\n\nSo:\n\ndo while (stack_size > 0)\n    ind = stack(stack_size - 1)\n    stack_size = stack_size - 1\n    rightl(ind) = N - ind - 1\nend do\n\nSimilarly for the leftl processing.\n\nNow, the leftl processing:\n\nWe process from index = N-1 downto 0.\n\nInitialize stack_size to 0.\n\nindex = N-1\ndo while (index >= 0)\n    do while (stack_size > 0 .and. a(stack(stack_size-1)) > a(index))\n        ind = stack(stack_size-1)\n        stack_size = stack_size -1\n        leftl(ind) = ind - index - 1\n    end do\n    stack(stack_size) = index\n    stack_size = stack_size +1\n    index = index -1\nend do\n\nThen, after processing all elements, process the remaining elements in the stack:\n\ndo while (stack_size > 0)\n    ind = stack(stack_size -1)\n    stack_size = stack_size -1\n    leftl(ind) = ind - (-1) -1  ! because index is now -1 (after loop)\n    ! Wait, after the loop, index is -1 (since the loop runs while index >=0)\n    ! So leftl[ind] = ind - (-1) -1 = ind +1 -1 = ind\nend do\n\nSo:\n\nleftl(ind) = ind - (-1) -1 = ind\n\nBut in Fortran, after the loop, index is -1. So yes.\n\nNow, compute the sum. The sum in Java is computed as a[i] * (leftl[i]+1) * (rightl[i]+1). So in Fortran:\n\nans = 0\ndo i = 0, N-1\n    ans = ans + int(a(i), kind=8) * (leftl(i) + 1) * (rightl(i) +1)\nend do\nprint *, ans\n\nBut in Java, a is an integer array, but the product can be large, so ans is a long. In Fortran, we need to use a 64-bit integer. So declare ans as integer(kind=8).\n\nPutting this all together.\n\nPotential issues to consider:\n\n1. Fortran's array indices. If using 0-based arrays, need to declare them correctly. For example, when allocating, use (0:N-1) for each array.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you allocate a(:), the default lower bound is 1. So to have 0-based arrays, you have to specify the bounds. For example:\n\nallocate(a(0:N-1), leftl(0:N-1), rightl(0:N-1))\n\nBut how to do that? Because the syntax is:\n\nallocate( a( dim-spec ), ... )\n\nYes. So for a 0-based array:\n\nallocate( a(0:N-1) )\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, stack_size, index, ind\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), leftl(:), rightl(:), stack(:)\n    integer(kind=8) :: ans\n\n    read(*,*) N\n    allocate(a(0:N-1), leftl(0:N-1), rightl(0:N-1))\n    do i = 0, N-1\n        read(*,*) a(i)\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute rightl\n    allocate(stack(0:N-1))\n    stack_size = 0\n    index = 0\n    do while (index < N)\n        do while (stack_size > 0 .and. a(stack(stack_size-1)) > a(index))\n            ind = stack(stack_size-1)\n            stack_size = stack_size - 1\n            rightl(ind) = index - ind - 1\n        end do\n        stack(stack_size) = index\n        stack_size = stack_size + 1\n        index = index + 1\n    end do\n    do while (stack_size > 0)\n        ind = stack(stack_size-1)\n        stack_size = stack_size -1\n        rightl(ind) = N - ind -1\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute leftl\n    stack_size = 0\n    index = N-1\n    do while (index >= 0)\n        do while (stack_size > 0 .and. a(stack(stack_size-1)) > a(index))\n            ind = stack(stack_size-1)\n            stack_size = stack_size -1\n            leftl(ind) = ind - index -1\n        end do\n        stack(stack_size) = index\n        stack_size = stack_size +1\n        index = index -1\n    end do\n    do while (stack_size > 0)\n        ind = stack(stack_size-1)\n        stack_size = stack_size -1\n        leftl(ind) = ind - (-1) -1\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute ans\n    ans = 0\n    do i = 0, N-1\n        ans = ans + int(a(i), 8) * (leftl(i) + 1) * (rightl(i) + 1)\n    end do\n    print *, ans\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop variables need to be correctly handled. For example, in the first read loop, the code uses do i = 0, N-1. But in Fortran, if N is 3, that would loop i from 0 to 2, inclusive. Which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the stack array is allocated with 0:N-1. But during each pass (rightl and leftl), the same stack array is used. But in the code, after the rightl pass, the stack is deallocated? No. Wait, the code allocates stack once. But after rightl processing, when we process leftl, the stack is reused.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after rightl is computed, the stack is not deallocated. Then, when processing leftl, we reset stack_size to 0 and reuse the same stack array. That's correct.\n\nBut in Fortran, the allocate statement for stack is done once. Wait, no. Looking at the code:\n\nAfter allocating a, leftl, rightl, there's an allocate(stack(0:N-1)). Then, after the rightl processing, the stack is used again for leftl processing.\n\nBut in the code as written, stack is allocated once, and during leftl processing, we reuse the same stack. That's fine.\n\nAnother possible issue: when a(stack(stack_size-1)) is accessed. Need to ensure that stack_size-1 is >=0. But in the do while loops, stack_size >0 is checked before accessing, so it's safe.\n\nTesting: Let's think about a small example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n1 2 3\n\nProcessing rightl:\n\nFor each index:\n\nindex=0: stack is empty. Push 0. stack_size=1.\n\nindex=1: a[1]=2. stack top is a[0]=1 <2. So push 1. stack_size=2.\n\nindex=2: a[2]=3. stack top a[1]=2 <3. Push 2. stack_size=3.\n\nAfter loop, process remaining stack:\n\nEach element (0,1,2) have rightl set to N - ind -1. N=3.\n\nind=0: 3-0-1=2.\n\nind=1:3-1-1=1.\n\nind=2:3-2-1=0.\n\nrightl: [2,1,0]\n\nProcessing leftl:\n\nProcess from 2 downto 0.\n\nindex=2: stack is empty. Push 2. stack_size=1.\n\nindex=1: a[1]=2. stack top a[2]=3>2. Pop 2. leftl[2] = 2 -1 -1=0. Push 1. stack_size=1.\n\nindex=0: a[0]=1. stack top a[1]=2>1. Pop 1. leftl[1]=1-0-1=0. Push 0. stack_size=1.\n\nAfter loop, process remaining stack (0). leftl[0] =0 - (-1) -1=0.\n\nSo leftl: [0,0,0]\n\nans = 1*(0+1)*(2+1) + 2*(0+1)*(1+1) +3*(0+1)*(0+1) = 1*3 + 2*2 +3*1 =3+4+3=10.\n\nBut the correct answer for this case is 10? Let's check.\n\nEach element's contribution:\n\nFor 1: the ranges where it is the minimum. Since it's the first element, it's the minimum in the subarrays [1], [1,2], [1,2,3]. So 3 occurrences. 1*3=3.\n\nFor 2: the subarrays where it's the minimum are [2]. Because in [2], but in [1,2], the min is 1. In [2,3], min is 2. So [2], [2,3], but wait, the problem might be different. Wait, the original code's logic is to find for each element a[i], the number of subarrays where a[i] is the minimum. The number of such subarrays is (leftl[i] +1) * (rightl[i]+1). So leftl[i] is the number of consecutive elements to the left that are larger than a[i]. Similarly for the right.\n\nIn this example, for a[1]=2:\n\nleftl[i] is 0 (since a[0] is 1 <2. So leftl[1]=0. rightl[i]=1. So (0+1)*(1+1) =1*2=2. So the number of subarrays where 2 is the min is 2. For example, [2], [2,3] (since 3>2). So 2 subarrays. So contribution is 2*2=4.\n\nFor a[2]=3: leftl=0, rightl=0. (0+1)*(0+1)=1. So contribution 3*1=3.\n\nTotal 3+4+3=10. So ans=10.\n\nThe code's output would be 10. The Fortran code should compute this correctly.\n\nNow, another test case.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n5\n3 1 2 5 4\n\nThe Java code's output is 3*1*4 +1*4*5 +2*2*2 +5*1*1 +4*1*1 = 12 +20 +8 +5 +4=49.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor a[0] =3:\n\nleftl[0]=0 (since no elements to left). rightl[0] is the number of elements to the right until a smaller element is found. The next element is 1, which is smaller. So rightl[0] =0 (distance from 0 to 0). So (0+1)*(0+1)=1. Contribution 3*1=3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate. Maybe this example is too complex. Let's proceed.\n\nAssuming the Fortran code correctly implements the logic, it should match the Java code.\n\nNow, potential issues in the code:\n\n- In Fortran, the stack is allocated as (0:N-1). But when N is 0, this could be an error. But the problem probably assumes N>=1.\n\n- The stack for the leftl processing is reused. Since stack_size is reset to 0 before processing, it's okay.\n\n- The use of 0-based arrays in Fortran. The code should handle that correctly.\n\n- The variables are properly declared. For example, ans is integer(kind=8) to handle large sums.\n\nThus, the translated code should work."
