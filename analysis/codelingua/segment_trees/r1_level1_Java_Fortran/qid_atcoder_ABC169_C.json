    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to convert this Java code to Fortran. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the Java code does. So the code reads a long integer a and a string b. Then it processes the string b by removing any dots, converts it to an integer, multiplies by a, divides by 100, and prints the result.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, I need to read the inputs. Java uses a Scanner, but Fortran uses READ statements. So for the first input, a is a long, which in Fortran would be an integer of kind 8 maybe? Or perhaps a 64-bit integer. Wait, but the problem says a is a long in Java, which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, maybe INTEGER*8. Then the second input is a string, which in Fortran is a CHARACTER variable.\n\nNext, processing the string. The Java code iterates over each character, skips the '.', and builds a new string. Then parses that as an integer. So in Fortran, I'll need to loop through each character in the string, check if it's not '.', and concatenate those into a new string. Then convert that string to an integer. Fortran has ICHAR and CHAR functions for characters. Also, the input could be like \"3.14\" which becomes 314, then multiplied by a and divided by 100. So the code is essentially handling a decimal number as a string to avoid floating point inaccuracies.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read a as an integer (maybe 8 bytes) and b as a string.\n\nIn Fortran, reading a string might need to be careful with leading/trailing spaces. The Java code uses next() which reads the next token. So in Fortran, perhaps using a formatted read. For example, READ(*,*) a, b. But need to test if that works. Wait, in Java, the second input is read as a String. So in the input, maybe the user enters something like 100 3.14, which would be split into two tokens. So in Fortran, reading a as integer and b as a character variable.\n\n2. Process the string b to remove '.'.\n\nLoop through each character in b, check if it's not '.', and append to a new string.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are fixed length, but can be manipulated by trimming and using substrings. Alternatively, create a character array. For example, let's initialize a new string as empty, then for each character in the original string, check if it's not '.', then add to the new string.\n\nWait, how to loop through each character in Fortran. Suppose b is a character variable of length, say, 10. Then do i = 1, len_trim(b), then check each character.\n\nBut the original Java code uses b.toCharArray(), which includes all characters, including any after the '.' even if there are multiple dots. So the loop checks each character, skips the dot, and appends the rest. So in Fortran, similarly, loop through each character in the input string (up to its length), and for each character, if it's not '.', add to a new string.\n\nBut in Fortran, building a string dynamically can be done by initializing a large enough character variable. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: b_processed\ninteger :: pos = 0\ndo i = 1, len_trim(b)\n    c = b(i:i)\n    if (c /= '.') then\n        pos = pos + 1\n        b_processed(pos:pos) = c\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, the processed string is b_processed(1:pos). Then convert this to an integer.\n\n3. Convert the processed string to an integer. In Fortran, that can be done with internal reads. For example:\n\ninteger :: b_int\nread(b_processed(1:pos), *) b_int\n\nBut need to make sure that the substring is correctly trimmed. Because if the original string had leading zeros or whatever, the read should parse it as an integer.\n\nThen, calculate (a * b_int) / 100. Since a is a long (maybe 64-bit integer), and b_int is a regular integer (but in Java, it's parsed as Integer, which is 32-bit). But in Fortran, the integer types need to handle the multiplication. So if a is INTEGER*8 and b_int is a regular integer (32-bit), the product might need to be stored in an INTEGER*8 variable. So perhaps declare all variables as INTEGER*8 to avoid overflow.\n\nWait, Java's code uses a * bInt, which is a long (64-bit) multiplied by an int (32-bit), resulting in a long. Then divided by 100. So in Fortran, the variables should be 64-bit integers.\n\nSo, in Fortran, declare a as INTEGER*8, b_int as INTEGER*8 as well. Then the product a*b_int is a 64-bit integer, divided by 100.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nPotential code outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC169_C\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: a, b_int, result\n    character(len=100) :: b, b_processed\n    integer :: i, pos\n    character :: c\n\n    read(*,*) a, b\n\n    pos = 0\n    b_processed = ''\n    do i = 1, len_trim(b)\n        c = b(i:i)\n        if (c /= '.') then\n            pos = pos + 1\n            b_processed(pos:pos) = c\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    read(b_processed(1:pos), *) b_int\n\n    result = (a * b_int) / 100\n    print *, result\n\nend program atcoder_ABC169_C\n\nWait, but in Fortran, initializing b_processed as a character(len=100) variable, but when you assign '' to it, it will pad with spaces. So the initial value is 100 spaces. Then, when we loop through and set pos:pos to the character, but the rest remain spaces. Then, when we read from (1:pos), the trailing spaces might not affect the integer conversion. But let's see.\n\nFor example, if the processed string is '314', then in b_processed(1:3) is '314', and the rest are spaces. When reading with 'read(b_processed(1:pos), *)', it should read '314' as the integer. So that should work.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, when you read a string with leading or trailing spaces into an integer, it's okay. So '314   ' would read as 314.\n\nAnother thing: the original Java code uses next() to read the string b, which in Java is the next token. So if the input is, say, '3.14', that's the entire token, which is read as the string. So in Fortran, reading with read(*,*) a, b would read a as the first token, and b as the second token. So that's correct.\n\nTesting with input 100 3.14. The code processes the '3.14' into '314', then converts to 314. Then a * b_int = 100 * 314 = 31400, divided by 100 is 314. So output is 314.\n\nAnother test case: input 198 1.01 \u2192 processed to '101' \u2192 198 * 101 = 19998 / 100 = 199.98 \u2192 but in integer division, it's 199. But Java's code uses integer division, so truncation. Similarly in Fortran, (a * b_int) is 198 * 101 = 19998 \u2192 19998 / 100 = 199.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nPotential issues: What if the input string for b has multiple dots, like '12.3.4'? The code would process it as '1234', which may not be intended, but that's what the Java code does. So the Fortran code is correct as per the original.\n\nAnother thing: variable types. In Fortran, when you read into a character variable, the length must be sufficient. So in the example, if the input is a string longer than 100 characters, the code would truncate. But in practice, the problem's constraints probably ensure that the input is manageable. But to be safe, the code uses a length of 100. Alternatively, use a larger length.\n\nBut in Java, the next() for the string can be of any length, but in practice, the code will process it correctly. So in Fortran, assuming that the input string is not longer than 100 characters. If the original problem's constraints allow for longer strings, then adjust the length.\n\nBut given the code in the question, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the code should work."
