    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first to understand what it does. \n\nSo the program reads an integer n, then reads n pairs of integers, storing them in two ArrayLists a and b. It finds the minimum value in a (left) and the maximum in b (right). Then it checks if there's a pair (a[i], b[i]) that equals (left, right). If found, it prints the index (i+1) and exits. Otherwise, prints -1.\n\nFirst, I need to replicate the data structures. In Java, they use ArrayList for a and b. In Fortran, I'll use arrays. Since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but the original code uses 0-based indices, I need to adjust that. Wait, the code loops from 0 to n-1, so in Fortran, the loop will be from 1 to n.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, I'll first read n, then read n pairs of integers into two arrays a and b. Then compute the min of a and max of b. Then loop through each element to check if a(i) equals left and b(i) equals right. If found, print i and exit. Else, after checking all, print -1.\n\nNow, let's think about variables. The Java code uses int for all variables. Fortran uses INTEGER. The INF is set to 1e9 +5. Wait, Java's (int) 1e9 is 1000000000, but 1e9 +5 would be 1000000005. So in Fortran, we can set INF to 1000000005 as well.\n\nSo in Fortran, declare left as INTEGER and initialize it to INF. Similarly, right is initialized to 0.\n\nFor reading input: In Java, they use Scanner. In Fortran, we can read from standard input. So read *, n, then allocate a and b arrays of size n, then loop from 1 to n, reading a(i) and b(i). \n\nWait, in the original code, the a and b are read as a_i and b_i for each segment, then left is the minimum of all a_i, right is maximum of all b_i. Then check if any segment has a_i == left and b_i == right. If yes, output the index (1-based? Because in Java, the loop starts at 0, and when found, it increments i before printing. Let's see: in the Java code, when found, i is the index (0-based), then it does ++i and returns. So the printed value is i+1. So in Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so just print i.\n\nWait, in Java, when it finds the index i (0-based), it does System.out.println(++i); which is i+1. So in Fortran, since the loop is 1-based, if found, print i.\n\nSo for the loop part:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (left == a.get(i) && right == b.get(i)) {\n        System.out.println(++i);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    if (a(i) == left .and. b(i) == right) then\n        print *, i\n        stop\n    end if\nend do\nprint *, -1\n\nYes.\n\nNow, handling the initial min and max. For left, initialized to INF, then for each a(i), take the minimum. Similarly for right, initialized to 0, take the maximum of each b(i).\n\nSo in Fortran, after reading all a and b:\n\nleft = INF\nright = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n    left = min(left, a(i))\n    right = max(right, b(i))\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the initial left is INF, then for each a.get(i), left is min between current left and a[i]. Same here.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nFortran program structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, left, right\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n    integer, parameter :: INF = 1000000005\n\n    read *, n\n    allocate(a(n), b(n))\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        read *, a(i), b(i)\n    end do\n\n    left = INF\n    right = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        left = min(left, a(i))\n        right = max(right, b(i))\n    end do\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (a(i) == left .and. b(i) == right) then\n            print *, i\n            stop\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, -1\n\n    deallocate(a, b)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you use the 'stop' statement, it terminates the program. So once found, it exits. Then, after the loop, print -1.\n\nYes. That's correct.\n\nI think that's the translation. Now, check for possible issues.\n\nVariables: All declared correctly. INF is a parameter. All variables are integers.\n\nTesting with sample input. For example, in the Java code, if input is:\n\n3\n1 3\n2 4\n5 6\n\nThen left is 1, right is 6. Check each pair. The third one has a=5, which is not left, so no. So output is -1.\n\nAnother test case: input 1 1000000000 1000000005. Then left is 1e9, right is 1e9+5. Check if that pair exists. Then output 1.\n\nYes. So the code should handle that.\n\nWhat about when multiple segments have a[i] = left and b[i] = right? The Java code returns the first occurrence. The Fortran code does the same because it stops at the first i.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the correct translation."
