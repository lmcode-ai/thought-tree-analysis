But regardless, the code needs to be translated as is. So in Fortran, the code for the loops inside i and j would be:\n\ndo i = 1, t-2\n    do j = 0, max_speed\n        ! first loop over x from 0 to d\n        do x = 0, d\n            if (j + x <= max_speed) then\n                if (dp(i-1, j+x) + j > dp(i, j)) then\n                    dp(i, j) = dp(i-1, j +x) + j\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n        ! second loop over x from d downto 0\n        do x = d, 0, -1\n            if (j - x >= 0) then\n                if (dp(i-1, j -x) + j > dp(i, j)) then\n                    dp(i, j) = dp(i-1, j -x) + j\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the max function can be used. So instead of the if statements, just set dp(i,j) = max( dp(i,j), ... ) So in Fortran, inside the x loops:\n\ndo x = 0, d if (j + x <= max_speed) then\n        dp(i,j) = max( dp(i,j), dp(i-1, j+x) + j )\n    end if\nend do\n\nSimilarly for the other loop. Now, after filling the dp array, the code checks the last time step (i = t-2) and finds the maximum dp[t-2][j] + v2 where |j -v2| <=d.\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = t - 2; i < t - 1; i++) {  // this loop runs once for i = t-2\n    for (int j = 0; j < 1150; j++) {\n        if (Math.abs(j - v2) <= d) ans = Math.max(ans, dp[i][j] + v2);\n    }\n} In Fortran, this corresponds to i = t-2 (since the first dimension is 0-based), so:\n\nans = -huge(0_8)  ! equivalent to Long.MIN_VALUE\n\ndo j = 0, max_speed\n    if (abs(j - v2) <= d) then\n        if (dp(t-2, j) + v2 > ans) then\n            ans = dp(t-2, j) + v2\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen print ans. Now, putting it all together. But I need to handle possible allocation issues. For example, if t=1, then t-2 would be negative, but Java's code has t-1 as the first dimension.",

So when t is 1, t-1 is 0, so the array is zero-length? But in Java, arrays can't have zero length. So perhaps the code expects t to be at least 2. But the problem statement may have t >=2. But in any case, the Fortran code must handle the allocation. So perhaps after reading t, check if t is 1, but that's probably handled by the problem's constraints. Assuming t >=2. So, in Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: v1, v2, t, d, i, j, x, ans\n    integer(8), parameter :: max_speed = 1149\n    integer(8), allocatable :: dp(:, :)\n    \n    read *, v1, v2, t, d\n    \n    if (t == 1) then\n        print *, v1\n        stop\n    end if\n    \n    allocate(dp(0:t-2, 0:max_speed))\n    \n    ! Initialize dp to -1e17\n    dp = -10**17_8\n    \n    ! Set initial condition\n    dp(0, v1) = v1\n    \n    ! DP loops\n    do i = 1, t-2\n        do j = 0, max_speed\n            ! First loop: x from 0 to d\n            do x = 0, d\n                if (j + x <= max_speed) then\n                    dp(i, j) = max(dp(i, j), dp(i-1, j + x) + j)\n                end if\n            end do\n            ! Second loop: x from d downto 0\n            do x = d, 0, -1 if (j - x >= 0) then\n                    dp(i, j) = max(dp(i, j), dp(i-1, j - x) + j)\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end do\n    \n    ! Find the maximum ans\n    ans = -huge(0_8) do j = 0, max_speed\n        if (abs(j - v2) <= d) then\n            if (dp(t-2, j) + v2 > ans) then\n                ans = dp(t-2, j) + v2\n            end",

But according to the problem's constraints, maybe v1 and v2 are within the possible range. But the Java code uses 1150 as the size, so indexes up to 1149. So the same applies to the Fortran code. So if the input v1 is greater than 1149, the code would crash. But perhaps the problem ensures that such cases are not present.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nSo, the problem seems to involve dynamic programming. The main variables are v1, v2, t, d. The code initializes a 2D array dp, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum total speed at time step i with speed j. The goal is to maximize the sum of speeds over t-1 steps, ending at v2 with a maximum change of d each step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure. The Java code uses nested loops: the outer loop for each time step, then for each possible speed j, and for each possible change x (from 0 to d). It updates the dp array by considering adding or subtracting x from the previous speed.\n\nFortran doesn't have built-in functions like Arrays.fill, so I'll need to manually initialize the dp array. Also, Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based indices. I need to adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nWait, the Java code's dp is a 2D array of size [t-1][1150]. The first dimension is the time steps (from 0 to t-2, since t-1 elements), and the second is the possible speeds. In Fortran, I'll need to declare dp as a 2D array with dimensions (t-1, 0:1149) or adjust it to 1-based, but maybe keeping the same ranges would be easier for translation.\n\nBut Fortran's array indices can start at any integer. So declaring dp as (t-1, 1150) would start from 1? No, in Fortran, if you declare dimension(1150), the indices go from 1 to 1150. But Java uses 0-based, so to match, in Fortran, maybe we should declare the second dimension as (0:1149). Similarly for the time steps: first dimension is 1 to t-1 (if t-1 is the size). Wait, Java's first dimension is t-1 elements, 0-based. So in Fortran, maybe declare dp as (0:t-2, 0:1149). Hmm, but Fortran's default lower bound is 1. Alternatively, adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe declare the dp array as dp(t-1, 1150) and adjust the indices. Let me think. The first loop in Java is for i from 0 to t-2 (since t-1 times). So in Fortran, maybe the first dimension runs from 1 to t-1-1 (i.e., 1 to t-2?), but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, set the first dimension to (1:t-1), but since the original code has t-1 elements, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, use 0-based indexing in Fortran by specifying the lower bounds. So for the first dimension, dp(0:t-2, 0:1149). That would match Java's 0-based indices. Because in Java, the first index is from 0 to t-2 (since size is t-1). So yes, that's possible. In Fortran, you can declare arrays with explicit lower bounds.\n\nSo declaring:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_speed = 1149\ninteger :: t\n! read t\ninteger, dimension(0:t-2, 0:max_speed) :: dp\n\nWait, but Java's code initializes dp as a long array. So in Fortran, we need to use integer of sufficient size. However, Fortran's integers have kind=8 for 64-bit. Alternatively, use integer(8) to match Java's long. So, perhaps declare dp as integer(8), dimension(0:t-2, 0:1149).\n\nBut in Java, the initial values are set to a very negative number, -(1e17). Since Fortran's integer might have limits, but if Java uses long (64-bit integer), then Fortran's integer(8) can handle that. So the initial value should be -1e17, but as an integer. However, 1e17 is a floating-point number. But in Java, (long) (1e17) would be 100000000000000000? Wait, but 1e17 as a double is approximately 1e17, but when cast to long, it's 100000000000000000, which is 10^17. So in Fortran, we can use the same value. So the initial value for dp is set to -10**17.\n\nBut in Fortran, how do we initialize the array? The Java code uses Arrays.fill for each row. So in Fortran, for each i in 0 to t-2, set all elements of dp(i, :) to -1e17.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, loops are necessary. So for the initialization, perhaps:\n\ndo i = 0, t-2\n    dp(i, :) = -10**17\nend do\n\nBut Fortran's array assignments can do that. However, the initial value in Java is -(long) (1e17), which is -100000000000000000. So in Fortran, as an integer(8), we can set it as -10_8**17.\n\nWait, but 10^17 is 1 followed by 17 zeros. Let's see: 10^17 is 100000000000000000. So in Fortran, writing 10**17 as an integer(8) would require using the correct syntax. So 10_8**17. But wait, 10**17 may exceed the maximum value for 8-byte integers? Let's check. The maximum value for a signed 64-bit integer is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. So 10^17 is 1e17 which is 100000000000000000. That's 1 followed by 17 zeros, which is 100,000,000,000,000,000. That's 1e17, which is less than 9e18 (the max for 64-bit). Wait no: 9e18 is larger. Wait 9e18 is 9 followed by 18 zeros. So 1e17 is 10^17, which is 100,000,000,000,000,000. That's 17 zeros. The maximum for a 64-bit signed integer is 2^63-1 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, which is about 9e18. So 1e17 is okay. So we can represent -1e17 as a 64-bit integer.\n\nSo in Fortran, the initial value for each element is -10**17_8. So when initializing, each element is set to that value.\n\nThen, dp[0][v1] = v1. So in Fortran, dp(0, v1) = v1.\n\nNext, the loops. The outer loop is for i from 1 to t-2 (since i starts at 1 and runs up to t-2, since the first dimension is 0 to t-2). Then for each j from 0 to 1149 (since Java's loop is 0 to 1149). For each j, loop over x from 0 to d and check j + x. Then loop x from d down to 0 and check j -x.\n\nIn Fortran, the loops would be similar. The code in Java's inner loops is:\n\nfor each x from 0 to d:\n    if j +x < 1150, then dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j+x] + j)\n\nSimilarly for x from d downto 0:\n    if j -x >=0, then dp[i][j] = max(..., dp[i-1][j-x] +j)\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i in 1 to t-2 (since Java's i starts at 1 and goes up to t-2, as the loop is i < t-1). So in Fortran, i would run from 1 to t-2 (assuming the first dimension is 0-based).\n\nThen for j from 0 to 1149:\n\nThen for x in 0 to d:\n\nCheck if j +x <1150, then take the maximum of current dp(i,j) and dp(i-1,j+x) +j.\n\nSimilarly, for x from d downto 0:\n\nCheck if j-x >=0, then take the maximum of current dp(i,j) and dp(i-1,j-x)+j.\n\nIn Fortran, for x in 0 to d:\n\ndo x = 0, d\n    if (j + x < 1150) then\n        dp(i,j) = max(dp(i,j), dp(i-1,j+x) + j)\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Java, for each x in 0 to d, and for each j, check j +x and j -x. Then update dp[i][j]. So for the first part, x ranges from 0 to d, and for the second part, x is from d down to 0, but in Java it's a loop from x=0 to x=d again? Wait no, the code in Java is:\n\nfor (int x = 0; x <= d; x++) {\n    if (j + x < 1150) dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j + x] + j);\n}\n\nThen:\n\nfor (int x = d; x >= 0; x--) {\n    if (j - x >= 0) {\n        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - x] + j);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, why two loops? Because in the first loop, x is added to j (so previous speed was j+x, and current is j, implying that we could have decreased by x. Wait, maybe it's considering possible transitions. For example, to get to speed j at time i, the previous speed could be j + x (so x is the decrease) or j -x (so x is the increase). But perhaps the code is considering both possibilities, allowing to reach j from higher or lower speeds.\n\nBut perhaps the two loops are redundant. However, according to the code, both possibilities are considered. So in Fortran, we need to replicate both loops.\n\nNow, after filling the dp array, the code then looks for the maximum value in the last time step (i = t-2, since the loop in Java is for i from t-2 to t-2) and j where |j -v2| <=d. Then ans is the maximum of dp[i][j] + v2.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the loops, we need to loop over j from 0 to 1149, check if abs(j -v2) <=d, and compute the maximum of dp(t-2, j) + v2.\n\nNow, handling the input and output. In Java, it's reading v1, v2, t, d. In Fortran, use read statements.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Fortran's integer division and array indexing.\n\n- The maximum speed is 1149, but when x is added, need to ensure j+x doesn't exceed 1149.\n\n- Initialization of dp with a large negative value.\n\n- Using integer(8) for dp to handle large numbers.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: v1, v2, t, d\ninteger(8) :: i, j, x, ans\ninteger(8), dimension(:, :), allocatable :: dp\n\nThen read the inputs:\n\nread *, v1, v2, t, d\n\nThen, allocate dp with dimensions (0:t-2, 0:1149) if possible. But Fortran's array allocation requires the size. So:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_speed = 1149\nallocate(dp(0:t-2, 0:max_speed))\n\nBut wait, t could be read as input. So in Fortran, after reading t, we need to allocate dp accordingly. So:\n\nread *, v1, v2, t, d\n\nallocate(dp(0:t-2, 0:max_speed))\n\nThen initialize all dp elements to -10**17_8.\n\ndo i = 0, t-2\n    dp(i, :) = -10**17_8\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, initializing a 2D array's rows. For each i, set all j in 0:max_speed to -1e17. So:\n\ndo i = 0, t-2\n    do j = 0, max_speed\n        dp(i, j) = -10**17_8\n    end do\nend do\n\nBut perhaps a more efficient way is a nested loop. Alternatively, using array assignments. But for clarity, perhaps nested loops.\n\nThen, set dp(0, v1) = v1.\n\ndp(0, v1) = v1\n\nThen loop for i from 1 to t-2 (since i starts at 1 and goes up to t-2, because the first dimension is 0-based, and i runs from 1 to t-2 (Java's i starts at 1 and loops while i < t-1, which is i <= t-2).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, t-2\n\nThen for each j from 0 to max_speed:\n\ndo j = 0, max_speed\n\nThen loop x from 0 to d:\n\ndo x = 0, d\n    if (j + x <= max_speed) then\n        if (dp(i-1, j+x) + j > dp(i, j)) then\n            dp(i, j) = dp(i-1, j+x) + j\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen loop x from 0 to d again, but in reverse? Wait, the Java code has two separate loops. The first loops x from 0 to d, and the second loops x from d down to 0. But in Fortran, for the second loop, x would go from d downto 0. So:\n\ndo x = d, 0, -1\n    if (j - x >= 0) then\n        if (dp(i-1, j -x) + j > dp(i, j)) then\n            dp(i, j) = dp(i-1, j -x) + j\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the second loop is for (int x = d; x >=0; x--). So in Fortran, the loop is x=d downto 0, step -1.\n\nSo combining these, inside the j loop, we have two x loops.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the first x loop is for x from 0 to d, and for each x, if j +x is <1150, then take the maximum. The second x loop is x from d downto 0, checking if j -x >=0, then take the maximum.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo x = 0, d\n    if (j + x <= max_speed) then\n        dp(i,j) = max(dp(i,j), dp(i-1, j +x) + j)\n    end if\nend do\n\ndo x = d, 0, -1\n    if (j -x >=0) then\n        dp(i,j) = max(dp(i,j), dp(i-1, j -x) + j)\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut wait, in the first loop, x is 0 to d, and for each x, check if j +x is within bounds (0 to max_speed). Then, the previous step's speed was j +x, and current speed is j. So the change was x decrease. Then, the second loop checks for x from d downto 0, so j -x is the previous speed (so current speed j is previous speed plus x). So the code is considering both possibilities: previous speed higher than current (x decrease) and previous speed lower than current (x increase). But why two separate loops? Because in the first case, the previous speed is j +x, which requires x steps decrease. So for each possible x (0 to d), we check all possible previous speeds that could lead to j with a decrease of x. Similarly, the second loop considers previous speeds that are j -x, which would require an increase of x to reach j. However, x is the same variable here, but I'm not sure why the code uses two loops. Perhaps to capture all possible x in both directions. \n\nBut regardless, the code needs to be translated as is.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code for the loops inside i and j would be:\n\ndo i = 1, t-2\n    do j = 0, max_speed\n        ! first loop over x from 0 to d\n        do x = 0, d\n            if (j + x <= max_speed) then\n                if (dp(i-1, j+x) + j > dp(i, j)) then\n                    dp(i, j) = dp(i-1, j +x) + j\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n        ! second loop over x from d downto 0\n        do x = d, 0, -1\n            if (j - x >= 0) then\n                if (dp(i-1, j -x) + j > dp(i, j)) then\n                    dp(i, j) = dp(i-1, j -x) + j\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\nend do\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, the max function can be used. So instead of the if statements, just set dp(i,j) = max( dp(i,j), ... )\n\nSo in Fortran, inside the x loops:\n\ndo x = 0, d\n    if (j + x <= max_speed) then\n        dp(i,j) = max( dp(i,j), dp(i-1, j+x) + j )\n    end if\nend do\n\nSimilarly for the other loop.\n\nNow, after filling the dp array, the code checks the last time step (i = t-2) and finds the maximum dp[t-2][j] + v2 where |j -v2| <=d.\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = t - 2; i < t - 1; i++) {  // this loop runs once for i = t-2\n    for (int j = 0; j < 1150; j++) {\n        if (Math.abs(j - v2) <= d) ans = Math.max(ans, dp[i][j] + v2);\n    }\n}\n\nIn Fortran, this corresponds to i = t-2 (since the first dimension is 0-based), so:\n\nans = -huge(0_8)  ! equivalent to Long.MIN_VALUE\n\ndo j = 0, max_speed\n    if (abs(j - v2) <= d) then\n        if (dp(t-2, j) + v2 > ans) then\n            ans = dp(t-2, j) + v2\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen print ans.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut I need to handle possible allocation issues. For example, if t=1, then t-2 would be negative, but Java's code has t-1 as the first dimension. Wait, in the Java code, the first loop is for i from 0 to t-2, and the array is new long[t-1][...]. So when t is 1, t-1 is 0, so the array is zero-length? But in Java, arrays can't have zero length. So perhaps the code expects t to be at least 2. But the problem statement may have t >=2. But in any case, the Fortran code must handle the allocation. So perhaps after reading t, check if t is 1, but that's probably handled by the problem's constraints.\n\nAssuming t >=2.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: v1, v2, t, d, i, j, x, ans\n    integer(8), parameter :: max_speed = 1149\n    integer(8), allocatable :: dp(:, :)\n    \n    read *, v1, v2, t, d\n    \n    if (t == 1) then\n        print *, v1\n        stop\n    end if\n    \n    allocate(dp(0:t-2, 0:max_speed))\n    \n    ! Initialize dp to -1e17\n    dp = -10**17_8\n    \n    ! Set initial condition\n    dp(0, v1) = v1\n    \n    ! DP loops\n    do i = 1, t-2\n        do j = 0, max_speed\n            ! First loop: x from 0 to d\n            do x = 0, d\n                if (j + x <= max_speed) then\n                    dp(i, j) = max(dp(i, j), dp(i-1, j + x) + j)\n                end if\n            end do\n            ! Second loop: x from d downto 0\n            do x = d, 0, -1\n                if (j - x >= 0) then\n                    dp(i, j) = max(dp(i, j), dp(i-1, j - x) + j)\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end do\n    \n    ! Find the maximum ans\n    ans = -huge(0_8)\n    do j = 0, max_speed\n        if (abs(j - v2) <= d) then\n            if (dp(t-2, j) + v2 > ans) then\n                ans = dp(t-2, j) + v2\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n    \n    print *, ans\n    \n    deallocate(dp)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the 'huge' function gives the largest positive value. So to get the minimum value, perhaps use -huge(0_8) -1, but that depends on the integer kind. Alternatively, use a very small value.\n\nBut in Java, Long.MIN_VALUE is -2^63. In Fortran, integer(8) can hold that. So perhaps setting ans to -huge(0_8) -1. Wait, but huge(0_8) returns the largest positive value. So the smallest value is -huge(0_8) -1? Let me check: For a 64-bit signed integer, the range is from -2^63 to 2^63-1. So the minimum value is -9223372036854775808, which is -2^63. The maximum is 9223372036854775807. So huge(0_8) returns 9223372036854775807. So to get the minimum, use -9223372036854775808_8. But in Fortran, how to write that?\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nans = -10**18_8  ! which is less than the possible minimum.\n\nBut in the Java code, the initial value is -(1e17), so perhaps ans can be initialized to that. But to match Long.MIN_VALUE, perhaps use:\n\nans = -huge(0_8) - 1_8\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, use a very large negative number. For example, set ans to -10**18_8.\n\nIn the Fortran code above, ans is initialized to -huge(0_8), which is -9223372036854775807, but the actual minimum is one less. So perhaps better to use:\n\nans = -huge(0_8) -1_8\n\nBut maybe it's better to use a very large negative number. Since in the DP, the maximum possible value can't exceed (t-1)*1149 (assuming all steps are maximum speed). So initializing ans to a very large negative value is okay.\n\nBut perhaps in the code, ans is initialized to the minimum possible value. So in Fortran, 'huge' gives the largest positive, so the smallest is -huge(0_8)-1. But how to express that?\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\ninteger(8), parameter :: min_val = -9223372036854775807_8 - 1\n\nBut perhaps in Fortran, it's easier to use a very small number like -10**18_8.\n\nBut perhaps in the code, the initial ans is set to the smallest possible value. So:\n\nans = -huge(0_8) -1_8\n\nBut in Fortran, this may not be possible due to integer overflow. So perhaps better to directly set ans to -huge(0_8), which is a large negative number, but not the minimum. However, given that the DP values are initially set to -1e17, which is larger than the minimum possible, the ans would be correctly updated.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nans = -10_8**18\n\nWhich is -1 followed by 18 zeros. But 10^18 is 1e18, which is larger than the maximum 64-bit integer. So that can't be represented as an integer. Wait, no. 1e18 is 1000000000000000000, which is 10^18. The maximum 64-bit integer is about 9e18. So 1e18 is representable. Wait, no. 1e18 is 1000000000000000000. 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 which is about 1.15e18. So 1e18 is less than that, so it can be represented as an integer.\n\nBut in Fortran, 10_8**18 is valid. So ans can be initialized as -10_8**18.\n\nBut perhaps the original Java code uses Long.MIN_VALUE which is -2^63. So in Fortran, the code should use the same initial value. So perhaps the code should set ans to -huge(0_8) -1. But how to compute that.\n\nWait, 0_8 is integer(8) 0. The huge(0_8) gives 9223372036854775807. Adding 1 gives 9223372036854775808, which is outside the range. So -huge(0_8) -1_8 is -9223372036854775807 -1 = -9223372036854775808, which is the correct minimum value.\n\nBut how to compute that in Fortran. Since in Fortran, huge(0_8) is 9223372036854775807. So:\n\nans = -huge(0_8) - 1_8\n\nYes, this would give the minimum possible integer(8) value.\n\nSo in code:\n\nans = -huge(0_8) - 1_8\n\nBut in Fortran, this is allowed? Let me check. For integer overflow, Fortran standards don't specify behavior, but in practice, using two's complement, this would work.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nans = -9223372036854775808_8\n\nBut in Fortran, how to write this literal. The number must be written as a negative value. But Fortran may not allow such a large literal. So perhaps the safest way is to compute it as -huge(0_8) -1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nans = -huge(0_8) - 1\n\nBut since ans is integer(8), and 1 is default integer, but in Fortran, when mixing kinds, it's better to use 1_8.\n\nans = -huge(0_8) - 1_8\n\nThis should correctly compute the minimum value.\n\nNow, let's test the code.\n\nAnother consideration: in Fortran, the loop variables (i, j, x) are declared as integer(8). But the default integer in Fortran is 4 bytes. So if t is large (e.g., 1e5), then using 4-byte integers for loop variables could overflow. So declaring i, j, x as integer(8) is better.\n\nSo in the variable declarations:\n\ninteger(8) :: v1, v2, t, d, i, j, x, ans\n\nYes.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, the sum variable is declared but not used. So in Fortran, we can ignore it.\n\nPutting all together, the code should be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: v1, v2, t, d, i, j, x, ans\n    integer(8), parameter :: max_speed = 1149\n    integer(8), allocatable :: dp(:, :)\n    \n    read(*, *) v1, v2, t, d\n    \n    if (t == 1) then\n        write(*, *) v1\n        stop\n    end if\n    \n    allocate(dp(0:t-2, 0:max_speed))\n    \n    ! Initialize dp to -1e17\n    dp = -10**17_8\n    \n    ! Set initial condition\n    dp(0, v1) = v1\n    \n    ! DP loops\n    do i = 1, t-2\n        do j = 0, max_speed\n            ! First loop: x from 0 to d\n            do x = 0, d\n                if (j + x <= max_speed) then\n                    dp(i, j) = max(dp(i, j), dp(i-1, j + x) + j)\n                end if\n            end do\n            ! Second loop: x from d downto 0\n            do x = d, 0, -1\n                if (j - x >= 0) then\n                    dp(i, j) = max(dp(i, j), dp(i-1, j - x) + j)\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end do\n    \n    ! Find the maximum ans\n    ans = -huge(0_8) - 1_8\n    do j = 0, max_speed\n        if (abs(j - v2) <= d) then\n            if (dp(t-2, j) + v2 > ans) then\n                ans = dp(t-2, j) + v2\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n    \n    write(*, *) ans\n    \n    deallocate(dp)\nend program main\n\nBut wait, the initial condition in Java is dp[0][v1] = v1. What if v1 exceeds 1149? Because max_speed is 1149. So if v1 is larger than 1149, then the code would have an array index out of bounds. But according to the problem's constraints, maybe v1 and v2 are within the possible range. But the Java code uses 1150 as the size, so indexes up to 1149. So the same applies to the Fortran code. So if the input v1 is greater than 1149, the code would crash. But perhaps the problem ensures that such cases are not present. Or maybe the code handles it by the constraints.\n\nBut in the Java code, the initial assignment is dp[0][v1] = v1, but if v1 >=1150, then the code would throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. So the code expects v1 to be <=1149.\n\nThus, the Fortran code assumes that the input v1 is <=1149. Similarly for v2.\n\nAnother thing: in the loop for x from d downto 0, the code may have x as 0, so j -x = j, which is allowed. So the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's test with a sample input.\n\nSample input from codeforces problem 534B:\n\nLet me recall the problem. The problem is about a car changing speed over t seconds. Initial speed v1, final speed v2. Each second, speed can change by at most d. What is the maximum possible sum of speeds.\n\nFor example, sample input 1:\n\n4 2\n4 0\n\nWait, maybe the sample input is:\n\nv1=4, v2=2, t=5, d=3.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem's sample input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 6\n\nSample Output 1:\n\n26\n\nWait, perhaps better to check.\n\nBut regardless, the code should work as per the Java code.\n\nThus, the Fortran code is translated as above."
