So:\n\nchar first_output_str[20]; // enough for integer.\n\nsprintf(first_output_str, \"%d\", ans);\n\nThen, process this string through the second step's logic. Second step's processing: replace commas with spaces. So:\n\nchar second_output_str[20]; // but need to know the length. Alternatively, process in place. Wait, the first_output_str may not have commas, but let's process it. Loop through each character in first_output_str:\n\nfor (i=0; first_output_str[i] ! = '\\0'; i++) {\n\n   if (first_output_str[i] == ',') \u2192 replace with ' '.\n\n}\n\nWait, but the first_output_str is the string representation of the integer, which can't have commas unless the integer was, say, 1,000 (but in Java, the readInt() would have read it as 1000, so the output would be \"1000\". So the first program's output is a number without commas. So the second step's processing may not change anything. But the code must still do the replacement. So in C, create a new string where commas are replaced by spaces. So:\n\nchar second_str[20]; // assuming the first's output is small enough. strcpy(second_str, first_output_str);\n\nThen loop through each character in second_str:\n\nfor (int i =0; second_str[i] ! = '\\0'; i++) {\n\n   if (second_str[i] == ',') second_str[i] = ' ';\n\n} Wait, but maybe the first's output is a negative number (like -1). So the string could be \"-1\". But the problem says the first program returns -1 in some cases, so the output would be \"-1\". So the second step's processing would leave it as \"-1\". So after processing, the second_str is the modified string (with commas replaced by spaces). Then, the third step's input is this second_str.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC174_C) reads an integer K from input, does some calculations, and returns an integer. The second file (atcoder_ABC051_A) takes a string, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. The third (codeforces_276_B) reads a string, checks the character counts, and decides \"First\" or \"Second\" based on odd counts.\n\nThe key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the sequence is: input -> first program's output -> second's input, then second's output -> third's input, and finally the third's output is the final result.\n\nIn C, I need to chain these steps without I/O in the middle. So the first part will read the initial input, process it through all three steps, and the last part outputs the final result.\n\nLet me break down each step:\n\n1. First Java program's solve() function:\n   - Reads K (integer), processes it, returns an integer answer.\n   - The processing steps: check if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 return -1. If divisible by 7, divide by 7. Multiply by 9. Then find the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) == 1. The remainder loop.\n\n   So in C, I need to read the initial K, perform these steps, then pass the result to the next step.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is the input to the second. Wait, the first program's output is the solve() result, which is an integer. But the second program expects a string (since it's processing a string input). Wait, that's a problem. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the first Java program's main calls solve() and prints the result. So the first program's output is the integer from solve(). The second program's input is that integer? But the second program expects a string (since it reads a line and replaces commas). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence.\n\nWait, the user said the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, which expects a string. But the first program's output is an integer. That would mean that the second program is expecting that integer as a string? Like, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program's input is \"5\", so it would replace commas (but there are none) and output \"5\".\n\nWait, but the second Java program (ABC051_A) takes a string input (the first line), replaces commas with spaces, and outputs that. So the first program's output must be a string that the second can process. But the first program's output is an integer. So perhaps the first program's output is the integer printed as a string. For example, if the first program returns 7, it would print \"7\", which is then the input to the second program. The second program would read that line, which is \"7\", and since there are no commas, output \"7\".\n\nThen the third program takes that output (the string from the second program) as input, which is the same as the first program's output (the integer as a string). Wait, but the third program's input is a string, which is the output of the second program. So the third program's input is the string from the second, which is the first's output (the integer) with commas replaced by spaces. Wait, but the first program's output is an integer, so unless that integer's string representation has commas, the second program's output would be the same as the first's output. For example, if the first program outputs 1234, then the second program's input is \"1234\", so the output is \"1234\".\n\nWait, but the third program's input is that string. The third program processes it as a string, counting characters. So the third program's input is the output of the second, which is the first's output (the integer) with commas replaced by spaces. But the first program's output is an integer, so unless that integer has commas in its string representation (unlikely), the second program's output is the same as the first's output. So the third program's input is the integer from the first program, converted to a string, then possibly modified by the second (if there were commas).\n\nHmm, okay. So the first program's output is an integer, which is printed as a string. The second program takes that string, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs that. The third program takes that string (the modified one) and processes it.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the K for the first program).\n2. Compute the first program's result (integer ans).\n3. Convert that integer to a string (so that it can be the input to the second step).\n4. Process that string through the second step (replace commas with spaces).\n5. Take the resulting string and process it through the third step (count characters, decide \"First\" or \"Second\").\n6. Output the final result from the third step.\n\nWait, but the second program's output is the modified string, which is then the input to the third. So the steps in C must be:\n\n- Read the initial input (the K value).\n- Run the first program's logic to get the integer result.\n- Convert that integer to a string (since the second program's input is a string).\n- Run the second program's logic on that string (replace commas with spaces).\n- Run the third program's logic on the resulting string (count characters, etc.).\n- Output the final result (either \"First\" or \"Second\").\n\nSo the C program must handle all these steps in sequence, without any I/O except the first read and the final output.\n\nNow, let's think about each part in C.\n\nFirst part: the first Java program's solve function.\n\nThe first program's solve function:\n\n- Reads K (from input). But in C, the first part will read K via stdin, so that's straightforward.\n\nThe steps in solve:\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 2 or 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n\nThen, if K is divisible by 7, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (K % 7 == 0) K /=7;\n\nThen K *=9;\n\nWait, but after dividing by 7, then multiply by 9? Let me see the code again:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nprivate static int solve() throws IOException {\n    int K = readInt();\n    if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n    if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n    K *= 9;\n    int ans = 1;\n    int remainder = 10 % K;\n    while (remainder != 1) {\n        ans++;\n        remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, so after checking that K is not divisible by 2 or 5, then check if divisible by 7. If yes, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9. Then compute the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) == 1.\n\nWait, but the K here is modified. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code first checks if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nThen, if K is divisible by 7, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9. So K becomes (original K divided by 7, if applicable) multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is:\n\nOriginal K is read. Then, if divisible by 7, K is divided by 7. Then K is multiplied by 9. Then the remainder loop.\n\nWait, but why? Let me think. The problem might be from ABC174 C, which is about finding the minimal length of a multiple of 7 that is all 9's? Not sure, but the code's logic is as written.\n\nSo in C, I need to implement this function.\n\nSecond part: the second Java program's processing.\n\nThe second program takes a string, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. So in C, given a string, replace all commas with spaces. So for example, \"a,b\" becomes \"a b\".\n\nThird part: the third program's processing.\n\nThe third program takes a string, counts the frequency of each character. Then counts how many have odd counts. If the number of odd counts is 0 or 1, or if it's an odd number (but wait, the code says: if (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 then \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, the code in the third Java program:\n\nfor each entry in the map, if the count is odd, increment oddCount.\n\nThen:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 \"First\"\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me check the code again:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nint oddCount =0;\n\nfor each entry in map:\n\n   if (entry.getValue() %2 !=0 \u2192 oddCount++;\n\nthen:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0 \u2192 \"First\"\n\nWait, that's the condition. So if oddCount is 0, 1, or any odd number (since oddCount%2 !=0 \u2192 which is true for any odd number), then \"First\". Else, \"Second\".\n\nWait, but if oddCount is even and greater than 1, then it's \"Second\".\n\nWait, for example:\n\nIf oddCount is 2 \u2192 even, so condition is false \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nIf oddCount is 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nWait, but the problem might be from Codeforces 276B, which is about a game where players take turns removing characters. The condition for first player to win is if the number of characters with odd counts is 0 or 1, or if it's odd. Hmm, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nSo in C, I need to process the string from the second step, count the frequency of each character, compute oddCount, then decide the output.\n\nNow, putting all together in C:\n\nThe steps in C:\n\n1. Read the initial integer K from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (ans):\n\n   - Check if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 if yes, ans is -1.\n\n   - Else, check if divisible by 7 \u2192 divide by 7.\n\n   - Multiply by 9 \u2192 new K_val = (K /7 if divisible) *9.\n\n   - Then compute the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K_val) ==1.\n\n   Wait, the code uses K after modification. Let me retrace:\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nAfter K is divided by 7 (if divisible), then K is multiplied by 9. So the new K is (original K divided by 7 if applicable) *9.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (K %7 ==0 \u2192 K /=7 \u2192 then K *=9.\n\nWait, so the K used in the remainder loop is the modified K (divided by 7 if needed, then multiplied by 9).\n\nWait, the code's K after that is K = (original K /7 if divisible) *9.\n\nWait, but the remainder loop uses this K.\n\nWait, the remainder is initialized as 10 mod K.\n\nWait, the loop is:\n\nans starts at 1.\n\nremainder = 10 mod K.\n\nThen while remainder !=1:\n\n   ans +=1\n\n   remainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nSo the loop continues until remainder is 1.\n\nThe answer is the ans when that happens.\n\nSo in C, I need to implement this.\n\nOnce the first part's answer is computed (ans), then:\n\n3. Convert that ans to a string. Because the second program's input is the output of the first, which is an integer. So the first program's output is the integer as a string. So for example, if ans is 5 \u2192 the string is \"5\".\n\nBut in C, how to convert the integer to a string? Use sprintf.\n\nSo:\n\nchar first_output_str[20]; // enough for integer.\n\nsprintf(first_output_str, \"%d\", ans);\n\nThen, process this string through the second step's logic.\n\nSecond step's processing: replace commas with spaces.\n\nSo:\n\nchar second_output_str[20]; // but need to know the length. Alternatively, process in place.\n\nWait, the first_output_str may not have commas, but let's process it.\n\nLoop through each character in first_output_str:\n\nfor (i=0; first_output_str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n   if (first_output_str[i] == ',') \u2192 replace with ' '.\n\n}\n\nWait, but the first_output_str is the string representation of the integer, which can't have commas unless the integer was, say, 1,000 (but in Java, the readInt() would have read it as 1000, so the output would be \"1000\". So the first program's output is a number without commas. So the second step's processing may not change anything. But the code must still do the replacement.\n\nSo in C, create a new string where commas are replaced by spaces.\n\nSo:\n\nchar second_str[20]; // assuming the first's output is small enough.\n\nstrcpy(second_str, first_output_str);\n\nThen loop through each character in second_str:\n\nfor (int i =0; second_str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n   if (second_str[i] == ',') second_str[i] = ' ';\n\n}\n\nWait, but maybe the first's output is a negative number (like -1). So the string could be \"-1\".\n\nBut the problem says the first program returns -1 in some cases, so the output would be \"-1\".\n\nSo the second step's processing would leave it as \"-1\".\n\nSo after processing, the second_str is the modified string (with commas replaced by spaces).\n\nThen, the third step's input is this second_str.\n\nThird step's processing:\n\nTake the second_str, count the frequency of each character.\n\nThen compute oddCount.\n\nThen decide \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nSo in C:\n\nInitialize a frequency array (since characters can be any, but in C, perhaps using a hash is tricky. Alternatively, since characters are ASCII, we can use an array of size 256 (for all possible chars).\n\nint freq[256] = {0};\n\nThen loop through each character in second_str:\n\nfor (int i=0; second_str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n   char c = second_str[i];\n\n   freq[c]++;\n\n}\n\nThen compute oddCount:\n\nint oddCount =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n\n   if (freq[i] %2 !=0) {\n\n      oddCount++;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nThen check the condition:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || (oddCount %2) !=0) {\n\n   printf(\"First\\n\");\n\n} else {\n\n   printf(\"Second\\n\");\n\n}\n\nWait, but the original code's condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0 \u2192 then \"First\".\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 \"First\".\n\nWait, the condition is (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd). Because oddCount%2 !=0 means it's odd.\n\nWait, so if oddCount is even and greater than 1 \u2192 then condition is false \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the logic.\n\nPutting all together in C:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead K from stdin.\n\nCompute the first program's answer (ans).\n\nConvert ans to a string (first_str).\n\nProcess first_str to replace commas with spaces (second_str).\n\nProcess second_str to count frequencies and decide the output.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int K;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &K);\n\n    // Compute first part's result\n    int ans;\n    if (K % 2 == 0 || K %5 ==0) {\n        ans = -1;\n    } else {\n        if (K %7 ==0) K /=7;\n        K *=9;\n        int remainder = 10 % K;\n        ans =1;\n        while (remainder !=1) {\n            ans++;\n            remainder = (remainder *10) % K;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Convert ans to string\n    char first_str[20];\n    sprintf(first_str, \"%d\", ans);\n\n    // Process second step: replace commas with spaces\n    char second_str[20];\n    strcpy(second_str, first_str);\n    for (int i=0; second_str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        if (second_str[i] == ',') {\n            second_str[i] = ' ';\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Process third step: count frequencies\n    int freq[256] = {0};\n    for (int i=0; second_str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        char c = second_str[i];\n        freq[c]++;\n    }\n\n    int oddCount =0;\n    for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n        if (freq[i] %2 !=0) {\n            oddCount++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (oddCount <=1 || (oddCount %2)!=0) {\n        printf(\"First\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Second\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but need to check for possible issues.\n\nFirst, the first part's calculation:\n\nWait, in the first Java code, after dividing by 7, then multiply by 9. Let me see:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nif (K %7 ==0 \u2192 K /=7 \u2192 then K *=9.\n\nWait, so K is modified in place. So after dividing by 7, then multiplied by 9. So the K used in the remainder loop is (original K divided by 7 if divisible) *9.\n\nWait, but in the code, after K is divided by 7 (if applicable), then multiplied by 9. So the K variable is updated.\n\nIn the C code, the code does:\n\nif (K %7 ==0 \u2192 K /=7 \u2192 then K *=9.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the C code, the original K is read, then modified. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the remainder calculation.\n\nThe remainder starts as 10 mod K.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nremainder = 10 % K.\n\nThen, in each step, remainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nWait, but in C, the modulo operator can give negative results if remainder is negative, but since K is positive (since it's divided by 7 and multiplied by 9, but original K is from input, but in the first condition, if K is even or divisible by 5, it returns -1. So when K is not even or divisible by 5, and after division by 7 (if needed), K is at least 1 (since K was not divisible by 2 or 5, but could be 1?).\n\nWait, but in the case where K is 1, then after division by 7 (if applicable, but 1%7 is not 0), so K remains 1. Then K *=9 \u2192 9. Then remainder is 10 mod 9 \u2192 1. So ans is 1. So that's okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: the loop for remainder. The loop continues until remainder is 1. The initial ans is 1, and remainder is 10 mod K. So if the initial remainder is 1, then ans is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the string handling:\n\nThe first_str is the string representation of ans. For example, if ans is -1 \u2192 first_str is \"-1\".\n\nThen, the second_str is the same, but commas replaced by spaces. Since the first_str is a number, it won't have commas, so second_str is same as first_str.\n\nThus, the third step processes the string \"-1\" (if ans is -1), or \"5\", etc.\n\nThe third step counts the characters. For example, \"-1\" has '-', '1', so frequencies: '-' \u21921, '1' \u21921. So oddCount is 2 (both counts are 1, which are odd). So 2 is even, so condition is (2 <=1 \u2192 no) or (2%2 !=0 \u2192 no \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nWait, but according to the third program's logic, if the oddCount is 2 (even and >1), then output \"Second\".\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nIn the case where the first program returns -1 (so the third step's input is \"-1\"), the characters are '-', '1', so each has count 1 \u2192 oddCount is 2. Since 2 is even and greater than 1 \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nBut according to the third Java program's code, when oddCount is 2 \u2192 condition is (2 <=1 \u2192 no) or (2%2 !=0 \u2192 no \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the first program returns 7 \u2192 the string is \"7\". The third step counts '7' once \u2192 oddCount is 1 \u2192 condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case: if the first program returns 123 \u2192 string \"123\" \u2192 counts 1,2,3 each once \u2192 oddCount 3 \u2192 which is odd \u2192 condition true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case: if the first program returns 121 \u2192 string \"121\" \u2192 counts 1:2, 2:1 \u2192 oddCount is 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nWhat if the first program's output is a very large number? Like, if the answer is a very big number, but in the problem's constraints, perhaps K is up to some limit. But in C, the integer can be up to 2^31-1, but when converting to a string, the buffer size of 20 should be enough. For example, 2^31 is about 10 digits, so 20 is sufficient.\n\nAnother possible issue: when K is 1. Let's see:\n\nSuppose K is 1 (input). Then first program's code:\n\nCheck if 1 is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 no. Then check if divisible by7 \u2192 no. So K remains 1, then multiply by9 \u2192 K becomes 9.\n\nThen remainder is 10 mod9 \u2192 1. So ans is 1. So the first output is 1 \u2192 string \"1\".\n\nThird step processes \"1\" \u2192 count 1 \u2192 oddCount 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: K=7 (input). Then first program:\n\nCheck 7 is not even or divisible by5 \u2192 okay. Then since 7%7 ==0 \u2192 divide by7 \u2192 K becomes 1. Multiply by9 \u2192 K=9.\n\nThen remainder is 10 mod9 \u21921 \u2192 ans=1. So output is 1 \u2192 third step says \"First\".\n\nAnother case: K=3 (input). Let's see:\n\nFirst program:\n\n3 is not even or divisible by5. Not divisible by7. So K becomes 3*9=27.\n\nCompute remainder:\n\nremainder starts as 10 mod27 \u219210.\n\nans=1.\n\nLoop:\n\nremainder is 10 \u2192 not 1.\n\nans becomes 2 \u2192 remainder =10*10 mod27 \u2192100 mod27 \u2192 100-3*27=100-81=19 \u2192 remainder 19.\n\nans=3 \u2192 19*10 mod27 \u2192190 mod27 \u2192 27*7=189 \u2192 1 \u2192 remainder is 1.\n\nSo ans is 3. So the first output is 3 \u2192 string \"3\".\n\nThird step: \"3\" \u2192 count 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code in C should handle all these steps correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the first program returns -1 \u2192 the string is \"-1\".\n\nThe third step counts '-', '1' \u2192 each count 1 \u2192 oddCount 2 \u2192 even \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the C code should be as written above."
