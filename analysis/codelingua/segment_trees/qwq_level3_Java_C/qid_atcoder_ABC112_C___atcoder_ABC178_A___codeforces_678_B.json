So the second program's output is (x !=1) ? 1 :0 \u2192 which is exactly 1 - (x ==1). So the second part's output is simply 1 - (x ==1). So in C, that's easy.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that works the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1 (atcoder_ABC112_C.java). It reads input from stdin: an integer n followed by n lines of x, y, h values. Then it loops over possible coordinates (i,j) up to MAX (100) and checks each to see if they form a valid \"center\" for the h values. The check function calculates the possible height at the center and verifies all h[i] match the formula. The first valid (i,j,ch) is printed.\n\nWait, actually, the code loops through all i and j from 0 to MAX, and for each, if check returns a positive ch, it prints the coordinates and ch. But the problem might require finding the correct center, so maybe the first valid one is the answer? Or perhaps there's only one valid, so the first one found is printed. The code as written would print all possible valid centers, but maybe the problem expects exactly one, so the first one is the correct one. Hmm, but the code in Java prints all possible, but perhaps in the problem's context, there's only one valid solution. Anyway, the code's behavior is to print all valid (i,j,ch) triples.\n\nThen File 2 (atcoder_ABC178_A.java) takes an integer x from input, checks if it's 1, then sets result to 0 if x is 1, else 1. Then outputs the result. So it's a simple toggle between 0 and 1.\n\nFile 3 (codeforces_678_B.java) takes a year y, checks if it's a leap year, then finds the next year after y where the total days from y+1 to that year modulo 7 equals 0, and also the leap status of that year matches the original y's leap status. Then outputs that year.\n\nNow, the sequence is: the output of File1 is input to File2, whose output is input to File3. Wait, but how exactly? Let me think. The first program's output is the printed line from the first Java code. The second program takes that as input. But the second program expects a single integer x. So the first program's output is a line with three numbers (i j ch). The second program would read that line, but since it's expecting a single integer, perhaps only the first number (i) is taken? Or maybe the entire line is read, but the code uses next() which would take the first token. Wait, in the second Java code, the first line is:\n\nint x = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());\n\nSo scan.next() reads the first token of the input. The first program's output is a line like \"a b c\", so the first token is a. So the second program takes that a as x, then outputs 0 if a is 1, else 1. Then that result is the input to the third program.\n\nWait, the third program expects a year y as input. So the output of the second program (0 or 1) is given as input to the third program. But the third program is expecting a year, which is an integer. So the second program's output (0 or 1) is the input to the third program. So the third program will read that 0 or 1 as the year y, then compute the next year after that which meets the conditions.\n\nWait, but 0 or 1 as a year? That might not make sense, but the code would process it. Let me see the third program's code:\n\nThe third program's main reads an integer y from input. So if the second program outputs 0, then the third program's input is 0, which is treated as the year. The code then checks if that's a leap year (using check_leap(0)), which according to the check_leap function, 0 mod 400 is 0, so it would be considered a leap year. Then it loops starting from y+1 (so 1) and accumulates days until the sum mod7 is 0, and the leap status of the current i matches the original y's leap status (which for y=0 is true). So the code would process that.\n\nBut regardless of the actual logic, the key is to translate the sequence into a single C program that does the same steps without I/O in between.\n\nThe challenge is to chain the three programs into one C program, where the first part (equivalent to File1) reads input, processes it, then passes the result to the second part (File2's logic) which processes it, then passes to the third part (File3's logic) which finally outputs the result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for File1 (the first Java program's input), process it, get the output (the first valid i,j,ch line). The first program's output is the first line printed (since the code in Java loops over all i and j, but perhaps the first valid one is the correct one, but the code as written would print all valid ones. Wait, but the problem might require that there is exactly one solution, so the first one found would be the correct one. However, the code in Java prints all possible valid triples. But in the problem's context, maybe there's only one, so the first one is printed first. But the code would print all, so the second program would read the first token of the first line. So in the C program, we need to process the first program's logic, get the first valid (i,j,ch) (or all, but take the first?), then pass the first number (i) to the second part, then the second part's result (0 or 1) is passed to the third part, which computes the required year and outputs it.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's output is multiple lines? Or just one? Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nThe first Java code loops over all i from 0 to MAX (100) and j from 0 to MAX. For each (i,j), it calls check, and if ch>0, it prints the line. So if there are multiple valid centers, it would print all of them. But the problem might have constraints that there is exactly one solution, so the first printed line is the correct one. However, the code as written would print all possible valid triples. So when the second program runs, it would read the first token of the first line printed by the first program.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, after processing the first part, we need to capture the first valid (i,j,ch) triple's i value, then pass that to the second part, then the second part's output (0 or 1) is passed to the third part.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- The C program will first read the input for the first Java program (n followed by n lines of x y h).\n\n- Then process the first Java's logic to find the first valid (i,j,ch) (or all, but pick the first one?), then take the i value (the first number in the first printed line).\n\nWait, but the first Java code's output is all valid triples. So the first line's first token is the first i value of the first valid (i,j,ch). So in the C code, after processing the first part, we need to find the first valid (i,j,ch) and take its i value.\n\nWait, but how does the first Java code's logic work? Let me re-examine the check function.\n\nThe check function for a given (cx, cy) computes ch as the maximum possible height at that center. The first part of the check function finds the first h[i] that is positive, then sets ch to |x[i]-cx| + |y[i]-cy| + h[i]. Then it checks for all other points whether h[i] equals max(ch - (distance), 0). If all are okay, returns ch, else -1.\n\nSo the first valid (i,j) would be the first (cx, cy) in the loops where check returns a positive value. Since the loops are in order i from 0 to 100, j from 0 to 100, the first valid (i,j) encountered would be the first one in the loop order. So in the C code, we need to find the first (i,j) where check returns a positive ch, then take that i as the input to the second part.\n\nTherefore, in the C code, after processing the first part, we can loop through i from 0 to 100, j from 0 to 100, and for each, compute check. The first (i,j) where check returns a positive ch is the one we need. Then take that i as the input to the second part.\n\nOnce we have that i, the second part's logic is straightforward: if i is 1, output 0; else output 1. Wait, no. Wait the second Java code's logic is:\n\nx = input (the first token from first program's output, which is i).\n\nThen, bool is true if x is 1, else false. Then result is !bool ? 1 : 0. Wait, let's see:\n\nbool = (x ==1) ? true : false;\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nWait, if x is 1, then bool is true, so !bool is false. So the condition is false, so the result is 0. If x is not 1, then !bool is true, so result is 1. So the result is 1 - x? Because if x is 1, result is 0; else 1. So the second program's output is 1 - x.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nboolean bool = x == 1 ? true : false;\n\nint result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nSo when x is 1, bool is true, so !bool is false. So the first condition is false, so the result is 0.\n\nWhen x is not 1, bool is false, so !bool is true, so result is 1.\n\nSo the result is (x !=1) ? 1 : 0. So the second program's output is 1 - (x ==1 ? 1 :0). So the output is 1 - x if x is 1? Wait no, it's 1 when x is not 1, 0 when it is. So the output is (x !=1) ? 1 :0. So the second program's output is 1 - (x ==1). So the output is 1 - (x ==1 ? 1 :0) \u2192 1 - x if x is 1? Wait no, let's see:\n\nWait, if x is 1 \u2192 output is 0 \u2192 1 -1 =0 \u2192 yes.\n\nIf x is 0 \u2192 output is 1 \u2192 1-0=1 \u2192 yes. So the output is 1 - (x ==1 ? 1 :0) \u2192 which is 1 - (x ==1). So the output is 1 - (x ==1). So the second program's output is (x !=1) ? 1 :0 \u2192 which is exactly 1 - (x ==1). So the second part's output is simply 1 - (x ==1). So in C, that's easy.\n\nThen the third part takes that output (0 or 1) as the input y, and processes it as per the third Java code.\n\nSo the third program's input is the second's output, which is either 0 or 1. The third program's code reads that as y, then proceeds to find the next year after y where the total days from y+1 to that year (inclusive?) sum mod7 is 0, and the leap status of that year matches the original y's leap status.\n\nWait, the third Java code's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = y + 1; ; i++) {\n\n    if (check_leap(i)) sum +=366 else 365.\n\n    if (sum %7 ==0) {\n\n        if ( (check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap) ) \u2192 then print and return.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the sum is accumulating days from y+1 up to i. Wait, no, the loop starts at i = y+1, and for each i, adds the days of that year (i) to the sum. So the sum is the total days from y+1 to i (inclusive). Wait, no, the loop is for each i starting at y+1, and each iteration adds the days of year i to the sum. So the sum is the total days from y+1 up to the current i. So when i is y+1, sum is days of that year. Then when i is y+2, sum is days of y+1 plus days of y+2, etc.\n\nThe condition is when sum mod7 is 0. Then check if the leap status of i (the current year) matches the original y's leap status. If so, output i and exit.\n\nSo the third part's code is to compute that.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single C program.\n\nThe steps in C:\n\n1. Read the input for the first part (n followed by n lines of x, y, h).\n\n2. Process the first part's logic to find the first (i,j) where check returns a positive ch. Take the i value.\n\n3. Compute the second part's result (1 - (i ==1 ? 1 :0)), which is 1 - (i ==1).\n\n4. Use that result as the input y for the third part.\n\n5. Process the third part's logic to find the required year and output it.\n\nNow, let's structure the C code.\n\nFirst, the first part's variables:\n\nWe need to read n, then n arrays x, y, h. Let's use arrays in C.\n\nThen loop over i from 0 to 100, j from 0 to 100, and for each, compute check. The first (i,j) where check returns a positive value is the one we need.\n\nWait, but in the first Java code, the loops are for i from 0 to MAX (100), and j from 0 to MAX. So in C, the loops would be:\n\nfor (int cx = 0; cx <= 100; cx++) {\n\n    for (int cy = 0; cy <= 100; cy++) {\n\n        int ch = check(...);\n\n        if (ch >0) {\n\n            // found the first valid, take cx as the i value.\n\n            // since we need the first in the loop order, we can break once found.\n\n            // so once found, we can store cx and break loops.\n\n            first_i = cx;\n\n            first_j = cy;\n\n            first_ch = ch;\n\n            goto found; // or break loops.\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nfound: ... then proceed.\n\nAlternatively, after finding the first valid, we can break out of the loops.\n\nSo in C code, perhaps:\n\nint first_i = -1;\n\nfor (int cx = 0; cx <= 100; cx++) {\n\n    for (int cy = 0; cy <= 100; cy++) {\n\n        int ch = check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy);\n\n        if (ch >0) {\n\n            first_i = cx;\n\n            first_j = cy;\n\n            first_ch = ch;\n\n            goto found;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nfound: ... \n\nWait, but maybe there are multiple valid, but we need the first in the loop order. So the first occurrence is the first (cx, cy) in the loops. So the first one found is the correct one.\n\nOnce we have first_i, then compute the second part's result: (first_i !=1) ? 1 :0 \u2192 which is 1 - (first_i ==1).\n\nThen, the third part takes that value as y.\n\nNow, the third part's code:\n\nWe need to compute the next year after y where the sum of days from y+1 to that year (inclusive?) such that sum mod7 is 0, and the leap status of that year matches the original y's leap status.\n\nWait, the original code's loop starts at i = y+1, and for each i, adds the days of that year (i) to the sum. So the sum is the total days from y+1 up to i (the current i). So when i is y+1, sum is days of that year. Then, when the sum mod7 is 0, check if the leap status of i (the current year) matches the original y's leap status.\n\nWait, the original code's leap variable is check_leap(y). So the original y's leap status is stored in 'leap'. Then, for each i (starting at y+1), after adding the days, if sum mod7 is 0, then check if (check_leap(i) == leap). If so, output i and return.\n\nSo in code:\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nfor (i from y+1 upwards):\n\n    add days of i to sum.\n\n    if (sum %7 ==0):\n\n        if (check_leap(i) == leap):\n\n            return i.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize sum =0.\n\nleap = check_leap(y).\n\nThen loop i from y+1 upwards:\n\nsum += days_of_year(i).\n\nif (sum mod7 ==0):\n\n    if (check_leap(i) == leap):\n\n        return i.\n\nProceed until found.\n\nNow, in C code, the check_leap function can be written as:\n\nint check_leap(int y) {\n\n    return (y %400 ==0) || (y%4 ==0 && y%100 !=0);\n\n}\n\nThe days_of_year function is 366 if leap, else 365.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the C program structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Function prototypes\n\nint check(int n, int x[], int y[], int h[], int cx, int cy);\n\nint check_leap(int y);\n\nint main() {\n\n    // Read input for first part.\n\n    int n;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    int x[n], y[n], h[n];\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &x[i], &y[i], &h[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    // Process first part to find first valid (cx, cy).\n\n    int first_i = -1;\n\n    for (int cx=0; cx <=100; cx++) {\n\n        for (int cy=0; cy <=100; cy++) {\n\n            int ch = check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy);\n\n            if (ch >0) {\n\n                first_i = cx;\n\n                goto found;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // If no found, but according to problem, there is a solution.\n\n    // Assuming found.\n\n    found:\n\n    // Now compute second part's result.\n\n    int second_result = (first_i !=1) ? 1 :0;\n\n    // Now process third part with y = second_result.\n\n    int y = second_result;\n\n    int leap = check_leap(y);\n\n    int sum =0;\n\n    for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n\n        int days = check_leap(i) ? 366 :365;\n\n        sum += days;\n\n        if (sum %7 ==0) {\n\n            if (check_leap(i) == leap) {\n\n                printf(\"%d\\n\", i);\n\n                return 0;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // The loop will eventually find a solution, so no return here.\n\n}\n\n// Implement check function.\n\nint check(int n, int x[], int y[], int h[], int cx, int cy) {\n\n    int ch = -1;\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        if (h[i] >0) {\n\n            ch = abs(x[i] - cx) + abs(y[i] - cy) + h[i];\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Now check all.\n\n    if (ch ==-1) return -1; // no h[i]>0?\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        int dist = abs(x[i] - cx) + abs(y[i] - cy);\n\n        int expected = (ch - dist) >0 ? (ch - dist) :0;\n\n        if (h[i] != expected) {\n\n            return -1;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return ch;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the check function, the first loop finds the first h[i]>0 and sets ch. Then the second loop checks all h[i] against the formula. If any fail, returns -1. Else returns ch.\n\nWait, in the Java code's check function:\n\nThe first loop is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (h[i]>0) {\n\n        ch = ... break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the first h[i] that is positive is used to compute ch. So in C, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the check function in C must compute that.\n\nNow, the check_leap function is straightforward.\n\nBut in C, the absolute value function is in <stdlib.h>, so need to include that.\n\nWait, the code uses abs(). So need to include stdlib.h.\n\nWait, in the check function, the code uses abs. So in the C code, we need to include <stdlib.h>.\n\nWait, the code above includes stdio.h, but not stdlib.h. So adding:\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nAlso, in the check function, the first loop may not find any h[i]>0. In that case, ch remains -1, and returns -1. But according to the problem's input constraints, there must be at least one h[i]>0, so perhaps that's okay.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nWait, in the first part, the code loops over cx from 0 to 100, and cy similarly. The first valid (cx, cy) is taken. The first_i is the cx of that.\n\nThen the second part's result is 1 if first_i is not 1, else 0.\n\nThen the third part uses that as y, and proceeds.\n\nNow, the third part's loop is infinite until it finds the correct i. Since the problem's code in Java uses an infinite loop, but in practice, it will find a solution eventually.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The first part's check function must be correctly implemented.\n\n- The first_i is the first cx found in the loops. The loops are in order of cx from 0 to 100, and for each cx, cy from 0 to 100. So the first valid (cx, cy) in that order is selected.\n\n- The second part's calculation is correct.\n\n- The third part's loop correctly accumulates days and checks the conditions.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the third part's code, the sum starts at 0, and for each i starting at y+1, adds the days of that year. So the first iteration is i = y+1, adding its days to sum. Then check sum mod7.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the first part's code, the check function's second loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (h[i] != Math.max(ch - ... ,0)) \u2192 in Java.\n\nIn C, the equivalent is:\n\nexpected = (ch - dist) >0 ? (ch - dist) :0;\n\nif (h[i] != expected) \u2192 return -1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, putting all together with proper includes and variable declarations.\n\nWait, in the main function, the variables first_i, first_j, first_ch are declared. But in the code above, first_j and first_ch are not used except for first_i. So perhaps just first_i is needed.\n\nAlso, the code uses a goto to exit the loops once found. Alternatively, after finding, break the inner loop and then the outer loop.\n\nAlternatively, after finding, set a flag and break.\n\nBut using goto is acceptable here for brevity.\n\nNow, the code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint check(int n, int x[], int y[], int h[], int cx, int cy);\nint check_leap(int y);\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int x[n], y[n], h[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &x[i], &y[i], &h[i]);\n    }\n\n    int first_i = -1;\n    for (int cx = 0; cx <= 100; cx++) {\n        for (int cy = 0; cy <= 100; cy++) {\n            int ch = check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy);\n            if (ch > 0) {\n                first_i = cx;\n                goto found;\n            }\n        }\n    }\nfound:\n    int second_result = (first_i != 1) ? 1 : 0;\n    int y = second_result;\n    int leap = check_leap(y);\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = y + 1; ; i++) {\n        int days = check_leap(i) ? 366 : 365;\n        sum += days;\n        if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n            if (check_leap(i) == leap) {\n                printf(\"%d\\n\", i);\n                return 0;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint check(int n, int x[], int y[], int h[], int cx, int cy) {\n    int ch = -1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (h[i] > 0) {\n            ch = abs(x[i] - cx) + abs(y[i] - cy) + h[i];\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (ch == -1) return -1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int dist = abs(x[i] - cx) + abs(y[i] - cy);\n        int expected = (ch - dist > 0) ? (ch - dist) : 0;\n        if (h[i] != expected) {\n            return -1;\n        }\n    }\n    return ch;\n}\n\nint check_leap(int y) {\n    return (y % 400 == 0) || (y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 != 0);\n}\n\nHmm, that should be correct. Let me check for possible errors.\n\nWait, in the check function, the first loop may not find any h[i]>0. For example, if all h[i] are zero. But according to the problem's input constraints, there must be at least one h[i]>0. So the code can assume that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's loops, the order is cx from 0 to 100, and for each cx, cy from 0 to 100. So the first valid (cx, cy) in this order is selected. The Java code does the same, so that's correct.\n\nThe second part's calculation is correct.\n\nThe third part's loop is correct.\n\nYes, this should work."
