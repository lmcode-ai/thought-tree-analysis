The prev array is already the previous step's dp. Wait, perhaps the prev array holds the previous step's dp. Wait, let me think again:\n\n       The prev array holds the dp[i-1][pre] values.

So in C, perhaps:\n\n       We can have two arrays, prev and curr. Initialize prev to all 0 except prev[0] =1 (for the initial state before any digits). Wait, no. Because for the first step (i=0), the previous is the initial state (pre=0 has count 1). So for i=0:\n\n           curr is computed based on prev (the initial state).

Wait, the base starts at 1 (before the first step). So before the loop, base =1. Then, after processing step i, the base is multiplied by 10 mod13. So the first step (i=0):\n\n           base is 1 (correct for 10^0). after processing, base becomes 10 mod13. Second step (i=1):\n\n           base is 10 mod13 (correct for 10^1). after processing, base becomes 10*10 mod13 = 100 mod13 = 9 (10^2 mod13). So this is correct.

First, the first part:\n\n       Read 5 integers into an array a[5].

Then the loop from 1 to 0 doesn't execute, so ans3 is 0. But the problem's third program's code may have different behavior for N=0. However, according to the third Java code, when N is 0, the loop for count=0 would not run, so ans is 0. Which matches. So this should handle all cases.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. The key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the C program must process the input through all three steps without I/O in between. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each Java file to understand what they do and how they pass data between each other.\n\nStarting with File 1 (atcoder_ABC123_B.java):\n\nThis program reads 5 integers from input. For each number, it calculates the remainder when divided by 10 (r[i]). If the remainder isn't zero, it calculates b as 10 - r[i], and stores this b as a key in a TreeMap with the original number as the value. The TreeMap is sorted, so the last key is the largest b. The program then finds the number corresponding to the largest b (or if all are 0, just sums all). The final answer is the sum of all numbers except the last one, rounded up to the next 10, plus the last number as is. The output is this sum.\n\nWait, actually, let me recheck. The code:\n\nThe TreeMap is used to track the 'b' values (the needed to round up to next 10). The largest b corresponds to the number that needs the most rounding. The last entry in the TreeMap (since it's sorted) is the one with the largest b. The program then adds all numbers except the last one, but for those not the last, if their mod 10 is 0, add as is, else add the rounded up (a[i] + (10 - r[i])). The last number is added as is. Wait, no, the code says:\n\nWait, the code for the ans:\n\nFor each i not the index of last, if a[i] mod10 is 0, add a[i], else add a[i] + (10 - r[i]). Then add the last number. So the last number is not rounded up? Because the last number is the one with the largest b, which is the one that has the remainder not zero (since otherwise it wouldn't be in the map). Wait, because the map is only for numbers where r[i] !=0. So the last number is the one with the largest b (so the one that needs the most rounding). But in the code, when adding the others, they are rounded up to the next 10. But the last one is added as is. Wait, why?\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe last number is the one with the largest b (since TreeMap is sorted by key). The code then loops through all a[i], and if it's the index of the last number (the one in the map's last entry), it skips adding it in the loop. Then adds it at the end. So the other numbers are rounded up to the next 10 (since their remainder is non-zero, so adding 10 - r[i] makes them round up). The last number is added as is. Wait, but why? Because the problem might require that the last number is not rounded? Let me see the problem's logic.\n\nThe problem's code seems to be for a specific problem (ABC123 B), but since I don't have the problem statement, I have to go by the code. The code's logic is that if all numbers are multiples of 10, then sum them all. Otherwise, the largest b (the one needing the most rounding) is the one that is kept as is, and others are rounded up. So the total is sum of all rounded up except the last one, plus the last one. Wait, no, the code adds the last one as is. Let me see:\n\nThe code for ans:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nThen, for each i not the index of last:\n\nif a[i] mod10 is 0, add a[i], else add a[i] + (10 - r[i]). Then, after that loop, add last (the a[i] at the index of the last element). So the last number is added as is. So the total is sum of all except last, rounded up (except those already multiples of 10), plus the last number as is. \n\nWait, but the last number's remainder is non-zero (since it's in the map). So the last number is not rounded. So the code is adding it as is. So the total is the sum of all numbers except the last, rounded up to the next 10, plus the last number as is. \n\nSo the output of this first program is the computed ans. That's the first step. The output of this is the input to the second program.\n\nNow, the second program (atcoder_ABC135_D.java):\n\nThis program reads a string of characters (probably a string with '?' and digits). It uses dynamic programming to compute some value modulo 1e9+7. The output is the value of dp[cs.length-1][5], which is the count of numbers formed by replacing '?' with digits such that the number mod 13 is 5. The output is this count mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, the problem is probably about counting numbers with certain conditions. The code uses a DP approach where dp[i][pre] represents the number of ways to form the first i+1 digits (since it's processed from the end?), such that the current value mod 13 is pre. The base is 10^i mod 13, perhaps. The final answer is the number of ways where the total mod 13 is 5. \n\nThe output of this second program is the computed dp value, which is an integer. This becomes the input to the third program.\n\nThird program (atcoder_ABC136_B.java):\n\nThis program reads an integer N and calculates how many numbers from 1 to N have an odd number of digits. For example, numbers with 1,3,5 digits etc. The code loops over the number of digits in N, and for each digit count, adds the appropriate count. The final output is the total ans.\n\nWait, let me see the code:\n\nThe code first counts the number of digits in N (count). Then loops for each i from 1 to count. For each i:\n\nIf i is the current count (the highest digit count), then if i is odd, add (N - 10^(i-1) +1). Else, nothing? Wait, the code says:\n\nif (i == count) {\n    if (i%2 ==1) ans += (N - Math.pow(10, i-1)+1);\n}\n\nElse, if i is not the last, then for i=1, add 9 (numbers 1-9). For other i's, if i is odd, add 10^i -10^(i-1). \n\nWait, the code is counting numbers with an odd number of digits. For example, numbers with 1 digit (1-9) contribute 9. Numbers with 3 digits (100-999) contribute 900 (since 999-100+1=900). So for each odd digit count, the total numbers with that digit count is 9*10^{i-1} (for i digits). Except for the last digit count, which may not be full. \n\nSo the third program's output is the count of numbers up to N with an odd number of digits. \n\nNow, the problem is to chain these three programs into a single C program. The first program's input is from stdin, the second takes the first's output as input, the third takes the second's output as input, and the third's output is the final output.\n\nSo the C program must read the input for the first program, process it through all three steps, and output the final result of the third program.\n\nThe challenge is to represent the data flow between the steps without I/O in between. So the first step's output (the ans from first Java program) is the input to the second program. The second's output (the DP result) is the input to the third program. The third's output is the final result.\n\nTherefore, in C, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (5 integers).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (ans1).\n\n3. Use ans1 as the input to the second program. Wait, but the second program's input is a string (the first program's output is an integer, but the second program expects a string input). Wait, this is a problem. Wait, the first program's output is an integer (the ans). The second program expects a string (the input is read via sc.next().toCharArray(); so the input is a single string, possibly with '?' and digits. Wait, but the first program's output is an integer. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string. So the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the second program. \n\nWait, this is a critical point. The first program's output is an integer (the ans). The second program's input is a string (the next input). So the first program's output is the input to the second program. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. So the second program's input is that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program's input is \"123\".\n\nWait, but the second program's code reads the input as sc.next().toCharArray(); which is the entire next input as a single token (so no whitespace). So the first program's output is a single integer, which is written to the second program's input as a string. So the second program's input is that number as a string. \n\nThen, the second program's output is another integer (the DP result), which is the input to the third program. The third program reads an integer N from input, so the second's output is that integer, which is passed as input to the third program.\n\nTherefore, the data flow is:\n\nInput to first program (5 integers) \u2192 first's output (integer) \u2192 second's input (as a string) \u2192 second's output (integer) \u2192 third's input (as integer) \u2192 third's output (final result).\n\nTherefore, in the C program, the steps are:\n\n- Read the 5 integers from stdin.\n\n- Compute the first program's result (ans1).\n\n- Use ans1 as the input string to the second program's processing. So the second program's processing is done with the string representation of ans1.\n\n- Compute the second program's result (ans2).\n\n- Use ans2 as the input integer to the third program's processing.\n\n- Compute the third program's result (ans3), which is the final output.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read the 5 integers from stdin.\n\n2. Process them through the first Java's logic to get ans1.\n\n3. Convert ans1 to a string (as a char array) to process through the second Java's logic.\n\n4. Process that string through the second's logic to get ans2.\n\n5. Convert ans2 to an integer (since the third program reads an integer N).\n\n6. Process that N through the third's logic to get ans3, which is printed.\n\nNow, translating each step into C.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first Java program's logic in C.\n\nFirst Program (Java to C):\n\nThe first program reads 5 integers a[0] to a[4]. Then for each a[i], compute r[i] = a[i] %10. If r[i] !=0, then b = 10 - r[i], and store in a TreeMap (sorted by key). The TreeMap's last key is the largest b, and the corresponding a[i] is the last element. Then compute the sum as described.\n\nIn C, since there's no TreeMap, we can track the maximum b and the corresponding a[i].\n\nWait, the TreeMap is used to sort the keys (b values) and get the largest. Since the keys are the b values (10 - r[i]), which are between 1 and 9 (since r[i] is non-zero). So the maximum b is the maximum of (10 - r[i]) for all a[i] with r[i] !=0. \n\nAlternatively, we can track the maximum b and the corresponding a[i].\n\nSo steps for first program in C:\n\n- Read 5 integers into an array a[5].\n\n- Compute r[i] = a[i] %10 for each i.\n\n- For each a[i], if r[i] !=0, compute b = 10 - r[i]. Keep track of the maximum b and the a[i] that has this b. Also, track if there are any non-zero r[i].\n\nWait, but the TreeMap also stores all the b's and their a[i], but the code only uses the last entry (the one with the largest b). So perhaps we can just track the maximum b and the corresponding a[i].\n\nSo variables needed:\n\nmax_b = -1 (initially)\n\nlast_a = 0 (the a[i] with the maximum b)\n\nhas_non_zero = false (whether any a[i] has r[i] !=0)\n\nLoop over each a[i]:\n\nr = a[i] %10\n\nif r !=0:\n\n   has_non_zero = true\n\n   b = 10 - r\n\n   if (b > max_b) {\n\n       max_b = b\n\n       last_a = a[i]\n\n   }\n\nAfter processing all:\n\nif (has_non_zero is false):\n\n   sum all a[i] and output.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute the sum as follows:\n\n   ans = 0\n\n   for each a[i]:\n\n      if a[i] is not last_a:\n\n          if (a[i]%10 ==0):\n\n              ans += a[i]\n\n          else:\n\n              ans += a[i] + (10 - (a[i]%10))\n\n      else:\n\n          // do nothing, added at the end\n\n   ans += last_a\n\n   output ans.\n\nWait, but how to track which a[i] is the last_a? Because there might be multiple a[i] with the same max_b. The TreeMap would have the last key (since TreeMap is sorted in order), but in case of same b, which a[i] is chosen?\n\nWait, in the original code, the TreeMap's lastKey() gives the largest b. The value stored is the a[i] that was last inserted with that key. Wait, no, TreeMap's put() overwrites the previous value for the same key. Because when you put a key that already exists, the previous value is replaced. So for example, if two a[i] have the same b, the later one will overwrite the previous entry. So the last a[i] with that b would be stored. \n\nWait, in the code:\n\nmap.put(b, a[i]);\n\nSo for each a[i], if r[i] !=0, then it's stored with key b. So if two a's have the same b, the later one will replace the previous entry. So the last a[i] with that b is stored. \n\nTherefore, in the code, the last entry in the TreeMap (the one with the largest key) is the a[i] with the maximum b. But if there are multiple a's with the same maximum b, the last one (in the input order) is stored. \n\nTherefore, in C, to track the last_a, we can track the a[i] with the maximum b. If there are multiple a's with the same max_b, the last one in the array (since we process in order 0 to 4) will be the one stored. \n\nWait, because in the loop, for each a[i], when we process them in order 0 to 4, if a new a[i] has a b equal to the current max_b, then the last_a will be updated to this a[i]. So the last occurrence of the maximum b is stored. \n\nTherefore, in C, the code can track:\n\nmax_b starts at -1.\n\nlast_a is initialized to 0.\n\nfor each i from 0 to 4:\n\n   r = a[i] %10\n\n   if r !=0:\n\n      b = 10 - r\n\n      if (b > max_b) {\n\n          max_b = b\n\n          last_a = a[i]\n\n      } else if (b == max_b) {\n\n          // this a[i] has same b as current max, so update last_a to this a[i]\n\n          last_a = a[i]\n\n      }\n\n      has_non_zero = true\n\nSo that way, the last_a is the last a[i] with the maximum b.\n\nOnce that is done, the sum is computed as:\n\nif (has_non_zero is false):\n\n   sum all a[i]\n\nelse:\n\n   ans = 0\n\n   for each i from 0 to4:\n\n      if (a[i] != last_a):\n\n          if (a[i]%10 ==0):\n\n              ans += a[i]\n\n          else:\n\n              ans += a[i] + (10 - (a[i]%10))\n\n      else:\n\n          // do nothing, added at the end\n\n   ans += last_a\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second program's input is the string representation of ans1. So in C, after computing ans1, we need to convert it to a string. For example, if ans1 is 123, then the input to the second program is the string \"123\".\n\nThe second program's logic is a DP problem. Let's see how to translate that into C.\n\nSecond Program (Java to C):\n\nThe second program reads a string (char array) and computes a DP table. The DP is a 2D array of size [n][13], where n is the length of the string. The DP[i][pre] represents the number of ways to form the first i+1 digits (since the loop is from 0 to n-1, but the string is processed in reverse order?), such that the current value mod 13 is pre. The base is 10^i mod 13. \n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nThe code processes the characters in reverse order (cs[cs.length -1 -i] for i from 0 to length-1). So for each position, starting from the end of the string. The base is initially 1, and multiplied by 10 each step mod 13. \n\nThe DP array is initialized as follows:\n\nInitially, dp[0][...] is for the first character (the last character of the original string). \n\nWait, let me retrace the code:\n\nThe loop for i from 0 to cs.length-1:\n\nThe current character is at position (cs.length -1 -i). So for i=0, it's the last character of the original string. For i=1, the second last, etc. So the loop is processing the string from the end to the beginning. \n\nThe base starts at 1. For each step, base is multiplied by 10 mod 13. \n\nThe DP array is of size [n][13], where n is the length of the string. \n\nThe DP transitions:\n\nFor each position i (current step in the loop), which corresponds to the (original string's) position (cs.length -1 -i):\n\nIf the current character is '?', then for each possible digit (0-9), we can choose it. \n\nElse, the digit is fixed (the character's value minus '0').\n\nThe DP[i][new_pre] is updated based on the previous DP[i-1][pre].\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nFor each previous state pre (0..12):\n\n   For each possible next digit (0-9 if '?', else only the fixed digit):\n\n      new_pre = (base * next_digit + pre) %13\n\n      dp[i][new_pre] += dp[i-1][pre] (or 1 if i==0 and pre is 0)\n\n      mod by MOD.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nIn the case of '?', the loop over next from 0 to9:\n\nfor (int next =0; next <10; next++) {\n\n   dp[i][ (base*next + pre) %13 ] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0));\n\n   mod.\n\n}\n\nElse, next is fixed, so the same loop but only for that next.\n\nThe base is 10^i mod13? Wait, let's see:\n\nThe base starts at 1 (before the loop). Then, after processing each step, base is multiplied by 10 mod13. \n\nWait, the code:\n\nbase = base *10 %13;\n\nWait, after the inner loops (for next and pre), the base is updated. \n\nWait, the code's loop:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n\n   ... processing for current character (cs[cs.length-1 -i])\n\n   ... \n\n   base = base *10 %13;\n\n}\n\nWait, so the base is updated after processing each step. \n\nWait, the base is initially 1. \n\nFirst iteration (i=0):\n\nprocess the last character (original string's last character). \n\nThen, base becomes 10 mod13 (10).\n\nSecond iteration (i=1):\n\nprocess the second last character. \n\nbase becomes 10 *10 mod13 = 100 mod13. 100/13 is 7*13=91, 100-91=9 \u2192 9 mod13.\n\nWait, but the base is used in the calculation for the current step. Let me see:\n\nThe current step is i, and the current character is at position (cs.length-1 -i). \n\nThe base is 10^i mod13? Because:\n\nInitially, base is 1 (10^0).\n\nAfter first iteration (i=0), base becomes 10^1 mod13.\n\nAfter second iteration (i=1), base becomes 10^2 mod13, etc. \n\nWait, but in the code, the base is multiplied by 10 each time. So after i steps, the base is 10^i mod13. \n\nWait, the base is used in the calculation for the current digit. \n\nThe formula for new_pre is (base * next + pre) %13. \n\nWait, the current digit is the (i-th step's character, which is the (original string's length -1 -i)th character. \n\nWait, perhaps the DP is tracking the value mod13 of the number formed so far, considering the digits processed so far (from the end towards the beginning). \n\nThe base represents 10^i mod13, where i is the number of digits processed so far (since each step adds a digit to the left). \n\nWait, perhaps the DP[i][pre] represents the number of ways to form the first (i+1) digits (from the end) such that the value mod13 is pre. \n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nWhen adding a new digit (to the left), the new value is (digit * 10^i + previous_value) mod13. \n\nWait, the previous_value is pre. The new digit is next. \n\nSo the new value mod13 is (next * (10^i) + pre) mod13. \n\nHence, the base is 10^i mod13, so next * base + pre mod13. \n\nTherefore, the base is indeed 10^i mod13. \n\nThus, the code's approach is correct. \n\nIn C, to implement this, we need to:\n\n- Read the input string (from the first program's output, which is ans1 as a string). \n\nWait, but in the C program, the first program's output is stored as an integer (ans1). So to get the string, we can convert ans1 to a string. \n\nIn C, to convert an integer to a string, we can use sprintf. \n\nSo steps for the second part:\n\nAfter computing ans1 (the first program's result), we need to convert it to a string. \n\nchar s[20]; // enough for up to 1e9+7, which is 10 digits, plus null.\n\nsprintf(s, \"%d\", ans1);\n\nThen, the length is strlen(s). \n\nThen, the DP array is a 2D array of size [n][13], where n is the length of the string. \n\nBut in C, we can use a 2D array. Since the maximum possible length of the input (ans1) is up to, say, 1e9 (if the first program's output is up to 1e9?), which is 9 digits. So n can be up to 10. \n\nSo we can declare a 2D array of size [10][13], but better to compute dynamically. \n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible length is small, we can use a fixed size. \n\nThe DP array can be represented as two 1D arrays (current and previous), since each step only depends on the previous step. \n\nWait, the DP[i] depends on DP[i-1]. So we can use two arrays: previous and current. \n\nThis would save memory. \n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize previous as an array of 13 elements. \n\nInitially, for i=0 (processing the first character, which is the last character of the original string):\n\nThe previous array is for i-1 = -1 (i=0). \n\nWait, the first step (i=0) corresponds to the first character (the last character of the original string). \n\nWait, let me re-express the steps:\n\nLet the string be of length n. \n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to n-1. \n\nAt each step i, the current character is s[n-1 -i]. \n\nThe base starts at 1. \n\nFor each step i:\n\n   current character is c = s[n-1 -i]\n\n   initialize current_dp array to 0.\n\n   for each pre in 0..12:\n\n      if (i ==0):\n\n          if (pre ==0):\n\n              previous contribution is 1 (since initial condition)\n\n          else:\n\n              0\n\n      else:\n\n          previous contribution is previous_dp[pre]\n\n      then, for each possible next digit (0-9 if c is '?', else only the digit):\n\n          compute new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13\n\n          current_dp[new_pre] += contribution\n\n          mod by MOD.\n\n   after processing all, set previous_dp = current_dp, and multiply base by 10 mod13.\n\nWait, but in code, the DP is stored as a 2D array. \n\nAlternatively, using two arrays (prev and curr):\n\nInitialize prev as all 0 except prev[0] =1 (for i=0, when processing the first character, the previous is the initial state (pre=0, count 1).\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nThe initial condition for i=0 (the first step):\n\nThe previous is the state before processing any digits. \n\nThe first digit (the last character of the original string) is being processed. \n\nThe recurrence for the first step (i=0):\n\nFor each possible next digit (if the character is '?', 0-9; else fixed digit):\n\n   new_pre = (base * next + 0) %13 (since previous pre is 0, because before processing any digits, the accumulated value is 0).\n\nWait, the initial pre is 0 (since before any digits, the value is 0 mod13). \n\nWait, the code's initial condition is:\n\ndp[i][(base * next + pre) %13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre ==0 ?1 :0));\n\nSo for i=0, the term is (pre ==0 ?1 :0). \n\nThus, for the first step (i=0), the previous pre is 0, and the contribution is 1. \n\nSo for the first step, the previous array is [1,0,0,...0].\n\nThen, for each next digit (possible digits for the current character):\n\n   new_pre = (base * next + 0) mod13.\n\n   curr[new_pre] += 1.\n\nThen, after processing all next digits, the curr array becomes the new prev array for the next step. \n\nThus, using two arrays (prev and curr) is manageable. \n\nSo in C:\n\nWe can have two arrays of size 13: prev and curr. \n\nInitialize prev to all 0 except prev[0] =1. \n\nWait, no. Wait, for the first step (i=0), the previous is the state before processing any digits. So for i=0, the previous is the initial state (pre=0, count 1). \n\nWait, the first step (i=0) corresponds to processing the first character (the last character of the original string). \n\nThe code's loop for i from 0 to n-1:\n\nAt each step, the current character is s[n-1 -i]. \n\nInitialize curr to all 0. \n\nThen, for each pre in 0..12:\n\n   if (i ==0):\n\n       prev_contribution = (pre ==0) ? 1 :0\n\n   else:\n\n       prev_contribution = prev[pre]\n\n   then, for each possible next digit (0-9 or fixed):\n\n       new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13\n\n       curr[new_pre] += prev_contribution\n\n       curr[new_pre] %= MOD\n\nWait, but the base is 10^i mod13. \n\nWait, the base starts at 1 (before the loop). \n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nbase is initialized to 1 before the loop. \n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   process the current character (s[n-1 -i])\n\n   then, after processing, base *=10 mod13.\n\nSo for the first iteration (i=0):\n\nbase is 1. \n\nAfter processing, base becomes 10 mod13. \n\nSecond iteration (i=1):\n\nbase is 10 mod13. \n\nAfter processing, base becomes 10*10 mod13 = 100 mod13 = 9. \n\nThird iteration (i=2):\n\nbase is 9. \n\nAfter processing, base becomes 9*10 mod13 = 90 mod13 \u2192 90 /13 is 6*13=78 \u2192 12 mod13. \n\nSo the base for step i is 10^i mod13. \n\nThus, in the code, the base is correctly set before processing each step. \n\nTherefore, in C:\n\nWe can track the base as a variable, starting at 1. \n\nInitialize prev array as all 0 except prev[0] =1. \n\nWait, no. Wait, for the first step (i=0), the previous array is the initial state (pre=0 has count 1). \n\nWait, the prev array before the first step is the initial state (pre=0 \u2192 count 1). \n\nWait, perhaps the initial prev array is set to all 0 except prev[0] =1. \n\nThen, for each step i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   current character is c = s[n-1 -i]\n\n   initialize curr array to all 0.\n\n   for each pre in 0..12:\n\n       contribution = prev[pre]\n\n       if (i ==0):\n\n           if (pre !=0):\n\n               contribution =0 \n\n           else:\n\n               contribution =1 \n\n       else:\n\n           contribution = prev[pre]\n\n       // Wait, no. The prev array is already the previous step's dp. \n\n       Wait, perhaps the prev array holds the previous step's dp. \n\n       Wait, let me think again:\n\n       The prev array holds the dp[i-1][pre] values. \n\n       So for the first step (i=0), the previous step is i-1 = -1, so the contribution is (pre ==0 ?1 :0). \n\n       So for the first step, the prev array is not used. \n\n       Hmm, this complicates things. \n\n       Maybe the initial prev array is for i-1 = -1, which is only valid for pre=0. \n\n       So for the first step (i=0), the prev array is not used. \n\n       So perhaps the code should be:\n\n       For each step i from 0 to n-1:\n\n           initialize curr to all 0.\n\n           for each pre in 0..12:\n\n               contribution = (i ==0) ? (pre ==0 ?1 :0) : prev[pre]\n\n               if (current character is '?'):\n\n                   for next in 0..9:\n\n                       new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13\n\n                       curr[new_pre] = (curr[new_pre] + contribution) % MOD\n\n               else:\n\n                   next = c - '0'\n\n                   new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13\n\n                   curr[new_pre] = (curr[new_pre] + contribution) % MOD\n\n           // after processing all, set prev = curr\n\n           prev = curr (copy)\n\n           base = (base *10) %13\n\n       Wait, but in code, the prev array must be updated. \n\n       So in C, perhaps:\n\n       We can have two arrays, prev and curr. \n\n       Initialize prev to all 0 except prev[0] =1 (for the initial state before any digits). \n\n       Wait, no. Because for the first step (i=0), the previous is the initial state (pre=0 has count 1). \n\n       So for i=0:\n\n           curr is computed based on prev (the initial state). \n\n       So the initial prev is the state before processing any digits (pre=0 has count 1). \n\n       So the initial prev array is set to prev[0] =1, others 0. \n\n       Then, for each step i from 0 to n-1:\n\n           curr is initialized to all 0.\n\n           for each pre in 0..12:\n\n               contribution = prev[pre]\n\n               if (current character is '?'):\n\n                   for next in 0..9:\n\n                       new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13\n\n                       curr[new_pre] = (curr[new_pre] + contribution) % MOD\n\n               else:\n\n                   next = c - '0'\n\n                   new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13\n\n                   curr[new_pre] = (curr[new_pre] + contribution) % MOD\n\n           // after processing all, set prev = curr\n\n           for (int j=0; j<13; j++) prev[j] = curr[j]\n\n           base = (base *10) %13\n\n       Wait, but the base is 10^i mod13. \n\n       Wait, the base starts at 1 (before the first step). \n\n       So before the loop, base =1. \n\n       Then, after processing step i, the base is multiplied by 10 mod13. \n\n       So the first step (i=0):\n\n           base is 1 (correct for 10^0).\n\n           after processing, base becomes 10 mod13.\n\n       Second step (i=1):\n\n           base is 10 mod13 (correct for 10^1).\n\n           after processing, base becomes 10*10 mod13 = 100 mod13 = 9 (10^2 mod13).\n\n       So this is correct. \n\n       So the code in C would be:\n\n       Initialize prev array as prev[0] =1, others 0.\n\n       base =1.\n\n       for (i from 0 to n-1):\n\n           current character is s[n-1 -i]\n\n           initialize curr to all 0.\n\n           for (pre from 0 to 12):\n\n               contribution = prev[pre]\n\n               if (current character is '?'):\n\n                   for (next from 0 to9):\n\n                       new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13\n\n                       curr[new_pre] = (curr[new_pre] + contribution) % MOD\n\n               else:\n\n                   next = c - '0'\n\n                   new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13\n\n                   curr[new_pre] = (curr[new_pre] + contribution) % MOD\n\n           // copy curr to prev\n\n           for (j=0; j<13; j++) prev[j] = curr[j]\n\n           base = (base *10) %13\n\n       After processing all steps, the answer is prev[5], since the final step is the last character (i =n-1), and the DP array after all steps is prev (since after the loop, prev is updated to curr of the last step). \n\n       Wait, the final answer is dp[cs.length-1][5], which in the code is the last element of the DP array. \n\n       Since in the code, the DP array is of size [n][13], and after processing all n steps, the last step is i =n-1, so the final prev array is the dp[n-1][...], so the answer is prev[5]. \n\n       So the second program's output is prev[5]. \n\n       So in C, after processing, the ans2 is prev[5]. \n\n       Now, the third program's input is this ans2. \n\n       Third Program (Java to C):\n\n       The third program reads an integer N and calculates the count of numbers from 1 to N with an odd number of digits. \n\n       The code in Java:\n\n       The code first counts the number of digits in N (count). \n\n       Then loops over each digit count from 1 to count. \n\n       For each i (digit count):\n\n           if i == count (the current digit count is the highest):\n\n               if i is odd, add (N - 10^(i-1) +1)\n\n           else:\n\n               if i is 1: add 9\n\n               else if i is odd: add 10^i - 10^(i-1)\n\n       So the total ans is the sum of these. \n\n       In C, this can be implemented as follows:\n\n       Read N (ans2 from second program).\n\n       Compute the number of digits in N:\n\n           count =0;\n\n           temp = N;\n\n           while (temp>0) {\n\n               temp /=10;\n\n               count++;\n\n           }\n\n       Then, initialize ans3=0.\n\n       for (i from 1 to count):\n\n           if (i == count):\n\n               if (i%2 ==1):\n\n                   ans3 += (N - pow(10, i-1) +1)\n\n           else:\n\n               if (i ==1):\n\n                   ans3 +=9\n\n               else if (i%2 ==1):\n\n                   ans3 += (pow(10,i) - pow(10,i-1))\n\n       So the final output is ans3. \n\n       Now, putting all together in C:\n\n       The steps are:\n\n       1. Read 5 integers into an array a[5].\n\n       2. Compute ans1 via first program's logic.\n\n       3. Convert ans1 to a string s.\n\n       4. Compute ans2 via second program's logic on s.\n\n       5. Compute ans3 via third program's logic on ans2.\n\n       6. Output ans3.\n\n       Now, handling the data types:\n\n       For the first program's ans1: it can be up to sum of 5 numbers each up to, say, 1e9 (if the input numbers are big). So the maximum possible ans1 is 5e9, which fits in a 32-bit integer (since 2^31 is ~2e9, but 5e9 is larger. So need to use 64-bit integers. Wait, but in the first Java code, the variables are int, which is 32-bit. So the maximum possible sum is 5*1e9 (if each a[i] is 1e9), which is 5e9, which is within 32-bit (since 2^31 is ~2e9, so 5e9 would overflow. Wait, 2^31 is about 2,147,483,648. So 5e9 is 5,000,000,000 which is larger. So in Java, using int would overflow. But the problem's original code may have constraints on the input. \n\n       Wait, the first Java program's variables are declared as int arrays. So the code may have an overflow issue if the sum exceeds 2^31-1. But assuming the problem's constraints are such that the inputs are small enough, or the code is correct as per the problem's requirements. \n\n       In C, to avoid overflow, we can use long long for ans1. \n\n       So in C:\n\n       The first program's variables:\n\n       a[5] as integers. \n\n       ans1 is a long long. \n\n       The second program's variables:\n\n       The DP uses MOD = 1e9+7, so the DP arrays must be modded by this. So the prev and curr arrays are of type long long, but modded each step. \n\n       The final ans2 is prev[5], which is a long long. \n\n       The third program's N is ans2, which can be up to 1e9+7 (since the second program's output is mod 1e9+7). \n\n       So the third program's N is up to 1e9+7, which is manageable as a long long. \n\n       Now, implementing all steps in C:\n\n       Let's start coding.\n\n       First, the first part:\n\n       Read 5 integers into an array a[5].\n\n       Then compute ans1:\n\n       int a[5];\n\n       for (int i=0; i<5; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n\n       Then compute the first program's logic:\n\n       int max_b = -1;\n\n       int last_a =0;\n\n       int has_non_zero =0;\n\n       for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n\n           int r = a[i]%10;\n\n           if (r !=0) {\n\n               has_non_zero =1;\n\n               int b =10 - r;\n\n               if (b > max_b || (b == max_b && a[i] > last_a)) {\n\n                   // Wait, no, the last occurrence with the same b is stored. \n\n                   // So if current b is equal to max_b, then update last_a to current a[i]\n\n                   if (b == max_b) {\n\n                       last_a = a[i];\n\n                   } else if (b > max_b) {\n\n                       max_b = b;\n\n                       last_a = a[i];\n\n                   }\n\n               }\n\n           }\n\n       }\n\n       Wait, the code above may not capture the case where multiple a[i] have the same max_b. \n\n       The correct way is:\n\n       For each a[i], if r !=0:\n\n           compute b =10 - r.\n\n           if (b > max_b):\n\n               max_b =b;\n\n               last_a =a[i]\n\n           else if (b == max_b):\n\n               last_a =a[i]; // because this is the later occurrence.\n\n       So the code should be:\n\n       for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n\n           int r = a[i]%10;\n\n           if (r !=0) {\n\n               has_non_zero =1;\n\n               int b =10 - r;\n\n               if (b > max_b) {\n\n                   max_b =b;\n\n                   last_a =a[i];\n\n               } else if (b == max_b) {\n\n                   last_a =a[i]; // update to the latest a[i]\n\n               }\n\n           }\n\n       }\n\n       Then, compute ans1:\n\n       long long ans1;\n\n       if (has_non_zero ==0) {\n\n           ans1 =0;\n\n           for (int i=0; i<5; i++) ans1 +=a[i];\n\n       } else {\n\n           ans1 =0;\n\n           for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n\n               if (a[i] != last_a) {\n\n                   if (a[i]%10 ==0) {\n\n                       ans1 +=a[i];\n\n                   } else {\n\n                       ans1 +=a[i] + (10 - (a[i]%10));\n\n                   }\n\n               }\n\n           }\n\n           ans1 += last_a;\n\n       }\n\n       Now, convert ans1 to a string s:\n\n       char s[20];\n\n       sprintf(s, \"%lld\", ans1);\n\n       int n = strlen(s);\n\n       Now, the second program's processing:\n\n       const long long MOD = 1e9+7;\n\n       long long prev[13] = {0};\n\n       prev[0] =1;\n\n       long long base =1;\n\n       for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n           char c = s[n-1 -i];\n\n           long long curr[13] = {0};\n\n           for (int pre=0; pre<13; pre++) {\n\n               long long contrib = prev[pre];\n\n               if (c == '?') {\n\n                   for (int next=0; next<10; next++) {\n\n                       int new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13;\n\n                       curr[new_pre] = (curr[new_pre] + contrib) % MOD;\n\n                   }\n\n               } else {\n\n                   int next = c - '0';\n\n                   int new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13;\n\n                   curr[new_pre] = (curr[new_pre] + contrib) % MOD;\n\n               }\n\n           }\n\n           // copy curr to prev\n\n           for (int j=0; j<13; j++) prev[j] = curr[j];\n\n           base = (base *10) %13;\n\n       }\n\n       long long ans2 = prev[5];\n\n       Now, the third program's processing:\n\n       long long N = ans2;\n\n       int count =0;\n\n       int temp = N;\n\n       while (temp>0) {\n\n           temp /=10;\n\n           count++;\n\n       }\n\n       long long ans3=0;\n\n       for (int i=1; i<=count; i++) {\n\n           if (i == count) {\n\n               if (i%2 ==1) {\n\n                   long long lower = (long long)pow(10, i-1);\n\n                   ans3 += (N - lower +1);\n\n               }\n\n           } else {\n\n               if (i ==1) {\n\n                   ans3 +=9;\n\n               } else if (i%2 ==1) {\n\n                   long long lower = (long long)pow(10, i-1);\n\n                   long long upper = (long long)pow(10, i);\n\n                   ans3 += (upper - lower);\n\n               }\n\n           }\n\n       }\n\n       printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans3);\n\n       Wait, but in the third program's code, the Java uses Math.pow which returns a double. So for large exponents, this might lose precision. However, in C, using pow(10, i-1) could also have precision issues for large i. \n\n       For example, if N is up to 1e9+7, then the maximum i is 10 digits (since 1e9 is 10 digits). \n\n       pow(10,9) is 1e9, which is within 32-bit integer (since 2^31 is ~2e9). So using pow is okay here, but better to compute it with integer arithmetic to avoid floating point inaccuracies. \n\n       Alternatively, compute the powers as integers:\n\n       For example, for i from 1 to count:\n\n           lower = pow(10, i-1)\n\n       can be computed as 10^(i-1). \n\n       Alternatively, compute it with loops:\n\n       For example:\n\n       long long lower = 1;\n\n       for (int k=0; k <i-1; k++) lower *=10;\n\n       But for i up to 10, this is manageable. \n\n       To avoid floating point inaccuracies, better to compute using integer multiplication. \n\n       So modifying the third part:\n\n       For the third program's loop:\n\n       for (int i=1; i<=count; i++) {\n\n           if (i == count) {\n\n               if (i%2 ==1) {\n\n                   long long lower =1;\n\n                   for (int k=0; k <i-1; k++) lower *=10;\n\n                   ans3 += (N - lower +1);\n\n               }\n\n           } else {\n\n               if (i ==1) {\n\n                   ans3 +=9;\n\n               } else if (i%2 ==1) {\n\n                   long long lower =1;\n\n                   for (int k=0;

In the first program's logic, when has_non_zero is 0, all a[i] are multiples of 10. So the sum is straightforward.\n\n       2. The second program's DP uses prev and curr arrays correctly. The base is updated correctly.\n\n       3. The third program's loop for counting digits is correct.\n\n       4. The third program's calculation of lower and upper uses loops to compute powers of 10, avoiding floating point.\n\n       Edge cases:\n\n       - First program's case where all a[i] are multiples of 10. \n\n       - Second program's input is a string with '?' characters. But since the first program's output is an integer, the second program's input will be a string of digits only (no '?'), so the code will handle that correctly.\n\n       - Third program's N=0? But since the second program's output is a count mod 1e9+7, which can be 0. But the third program's code for N=0 would have count=0 (since temp starts as 0, loop doesn't run, count remains 0). Then the loop from 1 to 0 doesn't execute, so ans3 is 0. But the problem's third program's code may have different behavior for N=0. However, according to the third Java code, when N is 0, the loop for count=0 would not run, so ans is 0. Which matches.\n\n       So this should handle all cases."
