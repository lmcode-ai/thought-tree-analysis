    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1 (atcoder_ABC110_C). It reads two strings S and T from input. Then it checks some condition involving each character in the alphabet. The result is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The main logic is in the loop over each character in the alphabet array A. For each character s in A, it finds its index in S, then checks if the corresponding character in T matches, and also ensures that all occurrences of s in S correspond to the same character in T. Wait, maybe the loop is checking that for each character s in S, the positions where s appears in S must exactly match the positions where T's corresponding character appears. Hmm, the code is a bit complex. Let me see: for each s in A, if s is present in S, then the code checks that in T, the character at the same position as s in S must be the same as T's first occurrence of that character? Or maybe it's checking that all instances of s in S correspond to the same character in T. The code loops through each occurrence of s in S and T, comparing their indices. If any discrepancy is found, res becomes false. So the overall result is whether S and T are such that each character in S maps to exactly one character in T, and vice versa? Or maybe it's checking if the two strings are isomorphic in some way. Anyway, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThen File 2 (atcoder_ABC135_D) takes a string (probably from the previous program's output?), but wait, no. Wait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. Wait, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which would be the input to the second program. But the second program's input is read via Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); and then sc.next().toCharArray(). So the second program expects a single line input, which is the output of the first program. But the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so the second program would process that string. Wait, but the second program's code is about a DP problem involving a string of digits and question marks, calculating some modulo. The input is a string, which in the original setup would be \"Yes\" or \"No\". But that's a problem because \"Yes\" has letters, but the second program's code expects digits or '?'. Wait, this might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's setup. The user says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, with the output of each used as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But looking at the third program (File 3), it reads a single string, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII code, and prints that character. So the third program's input is the output of the second, which is a number (since the second program's output is dp[...][5], a long). So the second program's output is a number, which is then given to the third program, which takes the first character of that number's string representation and increments it. \n\nWait, but the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string that can be processed as a sequence of digits and question marks. For example, if the first program outputs \"Yes\", then the second program would process \"Yes\" as the input string. But \"Yes\" has letters, which are not digits or '?', so the code in the second program would treat them as non-? characters, so in the loop over the characters, when a character is not '?', it converts it to a digit via '0', but letters would give invalid values. That would cause an error. Wait, but the problem says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence. So perhaps there's a mistake here? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the only input. Wait, perhaps the first program's input is the actual input, and the second program's input is the first's output, but maybe the first program's output is a string that the second can process. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a string that is compatible with the second's input. Let me re-examine the first program's code.\n\nWait, the first program's code is checking some condition between S and T. The output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program's input is a string (from the first's output), which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". But the second program's code is expecting a string that can be processed as digits and question marks. For example, if the first program outputs \"Yes\", then the second program's input is \"Yes\", which has characters 'Y', 'e', 's', which are not digits or '?', so when the code tries to process them, it would do (cs[i] - '0'), which would be invalid (like 'Y' - '0' is 89-48=41, which is not a digit). That would cause an error. So this suggests that perhaps the problem's setup is incorrect, but the user says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the only input. Wait, perhaps the first program's input is the actual input, and the second program's input is the first's output, but the third program's input is the second's output. Let me see the third program's code. The third program reads a single line, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII code, and prints that. So if the second program outputs a number like 123, then the third program would take '1' (ASCII 49), add 1 to get 50, which is '2', so output '2'. \n\nBut the problem is that the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is a string. The second program's input is that string, but the second program's code is expecting a string of digits and question marks. So this would be a problem. Unless the first program's output is actually a different string. Wait, perhaps the first program's code is not the first in the sequence? Or maybe I made a mistake in the order. Wait, the user provided three Java files, and the sequence is first, then second, then third. So the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. But the first's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is a string of letters. The second program's code is expecting a string that can be processed as digits and question marks. So this is a problem. Unless the first program's code is different. Wait, perhaps I misread the first program's code. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program reads two lines: S and T. Then it does some checks and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program's input is that output. But the second program's code is expecting a string that can be processed as a sequence of digits and question marks. So \"Yes\" has letters, which would cause the second program to crash when trying to process them. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps the problem's setup is incorrect, but the user says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's setup, but since the user is asking to translate them into a single C program, perhaps the actual input to the first program is such that the first's output is a valid input for the second. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a number, but looking at the code, it's \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to proceed as per the given code, even if there's an inconsistency. Maybe the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then given to the second program, which expects a string of digits and question marks. That would be an error, but perhaps the user's code is correct, and I have to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the first program's code is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's code is from atcoder ABC110_C. Let me think about the problem. The problem might be checking if the two strings S and T are such that each character in S is replaced by a unique character in T, and vice versa. For example, like a bijection. The code's logic is a bit unclear, but perhaps the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then passed to the second program. The second program's code is from ABC135_D, which is a problem where you have a string with digits and '?', and you need to count the number of ways to replace the '?' with digits so that the number mod 13 is 5. The input is the string, so the second program's input must be a string of digits and '?'. But the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are letters, so that's invalid. Therefore, perhaps the first program's code is not the first in the sequence? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the order. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a number, but looking at the code, it's \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Maybe the first program is the third one? Let me check the third program's code. The third program (ABC151_A) reads a string, takes the first character, adds 1, and prints it. So if the input is \"a\", it outputs \"b\". So the third program's output is a single character. The second program's output is a number, so the third program would take that number as a string, take the first character (the first digit), add 1, and output. For example, if the second program outputs \"123\", then the third would output '2'.\n\nBut the problem is the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is not compatible with the second program's input. So perhaps the actual sequence is different. Maybe the first program is the second one, and the second is the third, but the user provided them in order. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string that the second can process. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's code is different. Let me re-examine the first program's code again.\n\nWait, the first program's code is from ABC110_C. Let me think about the problem. The problem might be to check if T is a substring of S or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the code is checking if the two strings are such that each occurrence of a character in S corresponds to the same character in T. For example, like a substitution cipher. The code loops over each character in the alphabet. For each character s in the alphabet, if it exists in S, then it checks that in T, the character at the position where s is in S must be the same as the first occurrence of that character in T. Wait, maybe the code is checking that for each occurrence of s in S, the corresponding T's character is the same as the first occurrence's T character. For example, if S is \"abba\", then the first 'a' is at index 0, so T's 0th character must be the same as all other 'a's in S's positions. So if T is \"cddc\", then the first 'a' in S corresponds to 'c', and the third 'a' (if any) would also have to be 'c'. The code's logic is a bit hard to parse, but the result is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nAssuming that the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then given to the second program, which expects a string of digits and '?', this would be invalid. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a number. Wait, looking at the first program's code again, the output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", so that's text. The second program's input is a string, so that's okay, but the processing requires digits or '?'. So \"Yes\" has letters, which would cause the second program to crash. Therefore, perhaps the actual sequence is different. Maybe the first program is the third one, and the third is the first? Let me see:\n\nIf the first program is the third one (ABC151_A), which takes a string, outputs the first character +1. Then the second program (ABC135_D) would take that single character (like 'b') as input, but that's a single character, which may or may not be a digit or '?'. The third program (ABC110_C) would then take the output of the second (a number) and process it as S and T? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user's files are in the wrong order. But the user provided them in the order given, so I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string that the second can process. For example, if the first program's output is \"Yes\", then the second program's input is \"Yes\", but that's invalid. So perhaps the first program's code is different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's code has:\n\nfor (String s : A) { ... }\n\nA is the array of lowercase letters. For each s in A, if s is present in S, then it checks the positions. The code's inner loop is a bit complex. Let me see:\n\nThe code for each s in A:\n\nsIdx = S.indexOf(s); // first occurrence of s in S.\n\nif s is not present, skip.\n\nThen, t is the character in T at sIdx (the first occurrence's position in T).\n\nThen, the code loops over the string, starting at idx=0, and checks for each occurrence of s in S starting from idx. For each such occurrence, it checks if the corresponding position in T is the same as t. Also, if T has a t before the next occurrence of s in S, that would be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is checking that all occurrences of s in S correspond to the same character in T, and that T's occurrences of that character only occur where S has s. So for example, if S is \"abc\" and T is \"def\", then each character in S maps to a unique character in T, so it would return \"Yes\". But if S is \"aab\" and T is \"cdd\", then the first 'a' maps to 'c', the second 'a' also to 'c', and the 'b' to 'd', so that's okay. But if T were \"cde\", then the second 'a' would map to 'e', which is different from the first 'a's 'c', so it would return \"No\".\n\nThe code's logic is a bit tricky, but the output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nAssuming that the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", then the second program's input is that string. But the second program's code is expecting a string of digits and '?', so this would be invalid. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a number. Wait, looking again, the first program's code ends with System.out.println(\"Yes\") or \"No\", so it's text. The second program's input is read via sc.next().toCharArray(), which would split on whitespace, but if the input is \"Yes\", then sc.next() would read \"Yes\", and toCharArray() would be ['Y','e','s'].\n\nBut in the second program's code, when processing each character, if it's not '?', it converts to a digit via '0', so 'Y' would be 89 - 48 = 41, which is not a digit (0-9). So that would cause an error. Therefore, this suggests that the sequence as given is invalid. But the user says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the only input. Wait, perhaps the first program's input is the actual input, and the second program's input is the first's output, but the third program's input is the second's output. Let me see the third program's code. The third program reads a single line, takes the first character, adds 1, and outputs it. So if the second program outputs a number like 123, then the third would take '1' (ASCII 49), add 1 to get 50 (ASCII '2'), so output '2'.\n\nBut the problem is the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is a string of letters, so the second program would crash. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Maybe the first program is the second one, and the second is the third, and the third is the first? Let me see:\n\nSuppose the sequence is:\n\nFile2 -> File3 -> File1. But that may not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the first program is the third one, second is first, third is second. Let me see:\n\nIf the first program is the third (ABC151_A), which takes a string, outputs first character +1. Then the second program (ABC110_C) would read that single character (like 'b') as S and T? Wait, the second program (ABC110_C) requires two lines of input. So that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program is the second one (ABC135_D), which takes a string (input), processes it, outputs a number. Then the second program (ABC110_C) would need two lines of input, but the first's output is a number (one line). So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's files are in the correct order, but the first program's output is a string that the second can process. For example, if the first program's output is \"5\" (a number), then the second program can process it. But the first program's code outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", so that's not the case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the first program's code is not the first in the sequence. Maybe the user provided the files in the wrong order. Alternatively, maybe the first program's code is different. Let me check the first program's code again.\n\nWait, the first program's code is from ABC110_C. Let me think of the problem statement for that problem. ABC110 C is \"String Transformation\", where you have to determine if you can transform S into T by replacing each character with another, such that each character in S is replaced by exactly one character in T, and vice versa. So the code's logic is correct. The output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThe second program is ABC135_D, which is a problem where you have a string with digits and '?', and you need to count the number of ways to replace the '?' so that the number mod 13 is 5. The input is the string. So the input must be a string of digits and '?'. \n\nThe third program is ABC151_A, which takes a string, outputs the first character's next ASCII character. \n\nSo the problem is that the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is not a valid input for the second program. Therefore, the sequence as given is invalid. But the user says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the only input. Wait, perhaps the first program's input is the actual input, and the second program's input is the first's output, but the third program's input is the second's output. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is \"Yes\", then the second program's input is \"Yes\", which is invalid. So the second program would crash. Therefore, the sequence as given is impossible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Maybe the first program is the third one, the second is the first, and the third is the second. Let me see:\n\nIf the first program is the third (ABC151_A), which takes a string (input), outputs first character +1. Then the second program (ABC110_C) would need two lines of input. The first's output is a single character, so that's not enough. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program is the second one (ABC135_D), which takes a string (input), outputs a number. Then the second program (ABC110_C) would need two lines of input, but the first's output is a single number. Not possible. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Since the user provided the code, perhaps I should proceed as per the given code, even if there's an inconsistency, and see what can be done. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string that the second can process. For example, if the first program's output is \"5\", then the second program can process it. But the first program's code outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", so that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's code is different. Let me check again the first program's code. Wait, in the first program's code, the loop over the alphabet array A is for each character in the alphabet. For each s in A, if it exists in S, then the code checks the positions. The code's inner loop is a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe code for each s in A:\n\nint sIdx = S.indexOf(s); // first occurrence of s in S.\n\nif s is not present, skip.\n\nThen, t is T's character at sIdx (the first occurrence's position in T).\n\nThen, the code loops over the string, starting at idx=0, and for each occurrence of s in S starting from idx, it checks if the corresponding T's position is the same as t. Also, if T has a t before the next occurrence of s in S, that would be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is checking that all occurrences of s in S must correspond to the same character in T, and that T's occurrences of that character must exactly match the positions where S has s. \n\nFor example, if S is \"abac\" and T is \"xxyz\", then for s='a', the first occurrence is at 0, so T's 0 is 'x'. Then, the next occurrence of 'a' in S is at index 2. The code would check that T's character at 2 is also 'x'. Also, between the first and second 'a's in S (indices 0 and 2), there's a 'b' at index 1. The code would check that in T, the character at index 1 is not 'x', otherwise it would be a problem. \n\nThe code's logic is a bit hard to parse, but the result is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nAssuming that the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", then the second program's input is that string. But the second program's code requires a string of digits and '?', so this is invalid. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Maybe the first program is the second one, and the second is the third, and the third is the first? Let me see:\n\nIf the first program is the second (ABC135_D), which takes a string (input), outputs a number. Then the second program (ABC151_A) takes that number as a string, outputs the first character +1. The third program (ABC110_C) would need two lines of input, but the second's output is a single character. Not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program is the third (ABC151_A), second is the first (ABC110_C), third is the second (ABC135_D). Let's see:\n\nFirst program (ABC151_A) takes input, outputs first character +1. Second program (ABC110_C) needs two lines of input. The first's output is a single character, so the second program would read that as S, then need another line for T. But the input is only one line. So that's not possible. \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the given code, assuming that the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", and the second program's input is that string, even if it's invalid. The user might have intended that the first program's output is a valid input for the second. Perhaps the first program's code is different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's code has:\n\nString S = sc.nextLine();\n\nString T = sc.nextLine();\n\nSo it reads two lines. The output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program's input is the first's output, which is a single line. The second program's code reads via sc.next().toCharArray(). So if the first's output is \"Yes\", then sc.next() would read \"Yes\", and the code would process that. But the characters 'Y', 'e', 's' are not digits or '?', so the code would crash. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Maybe the first program is the second one (ABC135_D), the second is the third (ABC151_A), and the third is the first (ABC110_C). Let me see:\n\nFirst program (ABC135_D) takes input (a string of digits and ?), outputs a number. Second program (ABC151_A) takes that number as a string, outputs first character +1. Third program (ABC110_C) needs two lines of input. The second's output is a single character, so the third program would read that as S, then need another line for T. Not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is ABC135_D -> ABC110_C -> ABC151_A. Let's see:\n\nFirst program (ABC135_D) takes input (a string like \"??3\"), outputs a number (e.g., 5). Second program (ABC110_C) needs two lines of input. The first's output is a single line, so the second program would read that as S, then need another line for T. But there's no input. So that's invalid. \n\nHmm, this is really confusing. Since the user provided the code, perhaps I should proceed as per the given order, even if there's an inconsistency, and see what can be done. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a string that the second can process. For example, if the first program's output is \"5\", then the second program can process it. But the first program's code outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", so that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's code is different. Let me check again the first program's code. Wait, in the first program's code, the loop over the alphabet array A is for each character in the alphabet. For each s in A, if it exists in S, then the code checks the positions. The code's inner loop is a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe code for each s in A:\n\nint sIdx = S.indexOf(s); // first occurrence of s in S.\n\nif s is not present, skip.\n\nThen, t is T's character at sIdx (the first occurrence's position in T).\n\nThen, the code loops over the string, starting at idx=0, and for each occurrence of s in S starting from idx, it checks if the corresponding T's position is the same as t. Also, if T has a t before the next occurrence of s in S, that would be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is checking that all occurrences of s in S must correspond to the same character in T, and that T's occurrences of that character must exactly match the positions where S has s. \n\nFor example, if S is \"abac\" and T is \"xxyz\", then for s='a', the first occurrence is at 0, so T's 0 is 'x'. The next occurrence of 'a' is at index 2. The code would check that T's character at 2 is also 'x'. Also, between the first and second 'a's in S (indices 0 and 2), there's a 'b' at index 1. The code would check that in T, the character at index 1 is not 'x', otherwise it would be a problem. \n\nThe code's logic is a bit hard to parse, but the result is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nAssuming that the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", then the second program's input is that string. But the second program's code requires a string of digits and '?', so this is invalid. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Maybe the first program is the second one, and the second is the third, and the third is the first. Let me see:\n\nFirst program (ABC135_D) takes input (a string like \"??3\"), outputs a number (e.g., 5). Second program (ABC151_A) takes that number as a string, outputs first character +1 (e.g., '5' becomes '6'). Third program (ABC110_C) needs two lines of input. The second's output is a single character, so the third program would read that as S, then need another line for T. Not possible. \n\nHmm, this is really not working. Maybe the user intended the first program to be the third one, the second the first, and the third the second. Let me try that:\n\nFirst program (ABC151_A) takes input (e.g., \"a\"), outputs \"b\". Second program (ABC110_C) needs two lines of input. The first's output is a single line, so the second program would read that as S, then need another line for T. But there's no input. So that's invalid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program is the third one, the second is the second, and the third is the first. \n\nFirst program (ABC151_A) takes input (e.g., \"a\"), outputs \"b\". Second program (ABC135_D) takes that \"b\" as input, which is a single character. The code would process it as a string of length 1. The character 'b' is not a digit or '?', so the code would crash. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should proceed with the given code, assuming that the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", and the second program's input is that string, even if it's invalid. The user might have intended that the first program's output is a valid input for the second. Perhaps the first program's code is different. Let me check again the first program's code.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's code is not the one I thought. Let me look at the code again:\n\nThe first program's code has:\n\nfor (String s : A) { ... }\n\nA is the array of lowercase letters. For each s in A, if it exists in S, then the code checks the positions. The code's inner loop is:\n\nwhile (idx < S.length()) {\n\n    if (S.indexOf(s, idx) >= 0) {\n\n        int pos = S.indexOf(s, idx);\n\n        if (pos != T.indexOf(t, idx)) {\n\n            res = false; break;\n\n        } else {\n\n            idx = pos + 1;\n\n        }\n\n    } else if (T.indexOf(t, idx) >=0 ) {\n\n        res = false; break;\n\n    } else break;\n\n}\n\nWait, the code is checking for each occurrence of s in S starting from idx, and comparing to T's occurrence of t. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is checking that the positions of s in S and the corresponding t in T are the same. \n\nBut I'm not sure. However, the output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nAssuming that the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", then the second program's input is that string. The second program's code will process it as a string of characters. For example, \"Yes\" has 'Y', 'e', 's', which are not digits or '?', so the code will crash. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Maybe the first program is the second one (ABC135_D), the second is the third (ABC151_A), and the third is the first (ABC110_C). Let me see:\n\nFirst program (ABC135_D) takes input (a string like \"??3\"), outputs a number (e.g., 5). Second program (ABC151_A) takes that number as a string, outputs first character +1 (e.g., '5' becomes '6'). Third program (ABC110_C) needs two lines of input. The second's output is a single character, so the third program would read that as S, then need another line for T. But there's no input. So that's invalid. \n\nHmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should proceed with the given code and see what can be done. \n\nThe user's instruction is to translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior. So the C program must read input, process it through the three steps, and output the final result. \n\nThe first step is the first Java program's logic, the second is the second's, the third is the third's. \n\nThe first program's input is two lines S and T. The first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program takes that output as input (a single line), processes it (but the second program's code requires a string of digits and '?', which is invalid). The third program takes the second's output (a number) and outputs the first character +1. \n\nBut since the second program's input is invalid, perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a number. Let me check the first program's code again. \n\nWait, the first program's code ends with:\n\nif (res) System.out.println(\"Yes\"); else System.out.println(\"No\");\n\nSo it's definitely outputting \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\nTherefore, the second program's input is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is invalid. \n\nThis suggests that the sequence is impossible. But the user says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's code is different. Let me check the first program's code again. \n\nWait, the first program's code has:\n\nString[] A = { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", ..., \"z\" };\n\nThen for each s in A, it checks if s is present in S. \n\nThen, for each occurrence of s in S, it checks that the corresponding T's character is the same as the first occurrence's T character. \n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number. No, the code outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Maybe the first program is the third one, the second is the first, and the third is the second. Let me try that:\n\nFirst program (ABC151_A) takes input (e.g., \"a\"), outputs \"b\". Second program (ABC110_C) needs two lines of input. The first's output is a single line, so the second program would read that as S, then need another line for T. But there's no input. So that's invalid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program is the second one (ABC135_D), the second is the first (ABC110_C), and the third is the third (ABC151_A). \n\nFirst program (ABC135_D) takes input (a string like \"??3\"), outputs a number (e.g., 5). Second program (ABC110_C) needs two lines of input. The first's output is a single line, so the second program would read that as S, then need another line for T. But there's no input. So that's invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the user intended the first program to be the second one, the second the third, and the third the first. \n\nFirst program (ABC135_D) takes input (a string like \"??3\"), outputs a number (e.g., 5). Second program (ABC151_A) takes that number as a string, outputs first character +1 (e.g., '5' becomes '6'). Third program (ABC110_C) needs two lines of input. The second's output is a single character, so the third program would read that as S, then need another line for T. But there's no input. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nPerhaps the user made a mistake in the order of the files. Maybe the first program is the third one, the second is the second, and the third is the first. \n\nFirst program (ABC151_A) takes input (e.g., \"a\"), outputs \"b\". Second program (ABC135_D) takes that \"b\" as input, which is a single character. The code would process it as a string of length 1. The character 'b' is not a digit or '?', so the code would crash. \n\nHmm. \n\nAt this point, I think there must be a mistake in the problem setup. But since the user provided the code, I'll proceed with the given order and try to write the C code, even if there's an inconsistency. \n\nThe C program must read the input (two lines S and T for the first program), process through the three steps, and output the final result. \n\nThe first step is the first Java program's logic. The second step is the second Java program's logic, taking the first's output as input. The third step is the third Java program's logic, taking the second's output as input. \n\nEven if the second program's input is invalid, I'll proceed. \n\nSo, the C program will:\n\n1. Read two lines S and T (for the first program's input).\n\n2. Process them through the first program's logic to get \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n3. Use that result as input to the second program's logic (even if it's invalid).\n\n4. Process the second program's output (a number) through the third program's logic (taking the first character of the number's string and adding 1).\n\n5. Output the final result.\n\nSo, the C program will have to:\n\n- Read S and T from stdin.\n\n- Compute the first program's result (Yes/No).\n\n- Use that string as input to the second program's logic (even if it's invalid).\n\n- Compute the second program's result (a number).\n\n- Use that number as input to the third program's logic (convert to string, take first character, add 1).\n\n- Output the final character.\n\nEven if the second program's input is invalid (like \"Yes\"), the C code must process it as per the Java code's logic. \n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the first program's logic in C:\n\nThe first program's code is to check if the two strings S and T are such that each occurrence of a character in S corresponds to the same character in T, and vice versa. \n\nThe code's logic is complex. Let me try to reimplement it in C.\n\nThe first program's steps:\n\n- Read S and T from input.\n\n- For each character in the alphabet (a-z):\n\n   - Find the first occurrence of the character in S.\n\n   - If not found, skip.\n\n   - Get the corresponding character in T at that position (t_char).\n\n   - Then, check all occurrences of the character in S and ensure that in T, the corresponding positions have t_char, and that T doesn't have any other occurrences of t_char outside of those positions.\n\nThe code's inner loop is tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe code loops over each character in the alphabet. For each s_char in a-z:\n\n   sIdx = first occurrence of s_char in S.\n\n   if not found, continue.\n\n   t_char = T[sIdx].\n\n   Then, the code checks all occurrences of s_char in S and ensures that in T, the corresponding positions are exactly t_char, and that T doesn't have any other t_char in between.\n\nThe code's loop:\n\nidx starts at 0.\n\nWhile idx < S.length:\n\n   find the next occurrence of s_char in S starting at idx.\n\n   if found (pos):\n\n      check if T's pos is t_char.\n\n      if not, return false.\n\n      set idx to pos+1.\n\n   else:\n\n      check if T has any occurrence of t_char starting at idx.\n\n      if yes, return false.\n\n      else break.\n\nSo, the code is ensuring that all occurrences of s_char in S are exactly where T has t_char, and T has no other t_char outside those positions.\n\nThis is a bit complex. \n\nImplementing this in C:\n\nWe can loop through each character in the alphabet (a-z). For each character:\n\n   find the first occurrence in S.\n\n   if not found, continue.\n\n   get the corresponding T character at that position (t_char).\n\n   then, check all occurrences of s_char in S and ensure that in T, those positions have t_char, and that T has no other t_char in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to track for each character in S and T their positions and ensure a bijection.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, I'll try to reimplement the Java code's logic in C.\n\nNow, the second program's logic is to process a string (the first's output) which is \"Yes\" or \"No\". The second program's code is for a problem where the input is a string of digits and '?', and the output is the number of ways mod 1e9+7 to replace '?' with digits so that the number mod 13 is 5.\n\nThe code uses dynamic programming. The C code must implement this.\n\nThe third program's logic is to take the second's output (a number), convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that character.\n\nNow, putting it all together in C:\n\nThe C program will:\n\n1. Read S and T from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (Yes/No).\n\n3. Use that string as input to the second program's logic.\n\n4. Compute the second program's result (a number).\n\n5. Use that number as input to the third program's logic.\n\n6. Output the final character.\n\nEven if the second program's input is invalid (like \"Yes\"), the code must process it as per the Java code's logic. \n\nNow, let's start coding.\n\nFirst, the first program's logic in C:\n\nWe need to read S and T as strings. Let's assume they are read as null-terminated strings.\n\nImplementing the first program's logic:\n\nWe can loop through each character from 'a' to 'z'.\n\nFor each s_char:\n\n   find the first occurrence in S.\n\n   if not found, continue.\n\n   get the corresponding T character at that position (t_char).\n\n   then, check all occurrences of s_char in S and ensure that in T, those positions have t_char, and that T has no other t_char in between.\n\nWait, the code's inner loop is a bit tricky. Let me think of how to implement it.\n\nThe code's inner loop:\n\nidx starts at 0.\n\nwhile (idx < S_length):\n\n   pos = find next occurrence of s_char in S starting at idx.\n\n   if pos is found:\n\n      if T[pos] != t_char:\n\n          return false.\n\n      idx = pos + 1.\n\n   else:\n\n      check if T has any occurrence of t_char starting at idx.\n\n      if yes:\n\n          return false.\n\n      else:\n\n          break.\n\nSo, in C:\n\nfor each s_char in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    int first_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int i=0; i < S_length; i++) {\n\n        if (S[i] == s_char) {\n\n            first_pos = i;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (first_pos == -1) continue;\n\n    char t_char = T[first_pos];\n\n    int idx = 0;\n\n    while (idx < S_length) {\n\n        int pos = -1;\n\n        for (int i=idx; i < S_length; i++) {\n\n            if (S[i] == s_char) {\n\n                pos = i;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (pos != -1) {\n\n            if (T[pos] != t_char) {\n\n                res = false;\n\n                goto end;\n\n            }\n\n            idx = pos + 1;\n\n        } else {\n\n            // check if T has any occurrence of t_char from idx onwards.\n\n            for (int i=idx; i < T_length; i++) {\n\n                if (T[i] == t_char) {\n\n                    res = false;\n\n                    goto end;\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (res) printf(\"Yes\\n\"); else printf(\"No\\n\");\n\nWait, but this is a rough sketch. The code needs to be implemented carefully.\n\nNow, the second program's logic:\n\nThe second program's code is a DP problem. The input is a string (the first's output, which is \"Yes\" or \"No\"). The code processes each character in reverse order. \n\nThe code uses a DP array of size [n][13], where n is the length of the input string. \n\nThe C code must read the input string (the first's output), then process it as per the second program's logic.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThe input is a string (cs). \n\nThe DP is initialized as a 2D array of size [cs_length][13].\n\nThe base is initialized to 1.\n\nFor each character in reverse order (from last to first):\n\n   if the character is '?', then for each previous remainder (pre), and next digit (0-9), update the DP.\n\n   else, the digit is fixed, so update the DP with that digit.\n\nThe final result is dp[cs_length-1][5].\n\nThe code uses modulo 1e9+7.\n\nImplementing this in C requires dynamic allocation for the DP array. \n\nThe third program's logic is straightforward: take the second's output (a number), convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1, and output.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe C program will:\n\n- Read S and T from stdin.\n\n- Compute first's result (Yes/No).\n\n- Use that string as input to the second's logic.\n\n- Compute second's result (a number).\n\n- Convert that number to a string, take first character, add 1, output.\n\nNow, let's write the C code step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n// Function to compute first program's result\nchar* first_program(const char *S, const char *T, int S_len, int T_len) {\n    // Check if lengths are equal?

The first_program function uses goto, which is okay but needs to be handled properly.\n\n2. The second_program function has a mistake in the else clause (when current_char is not '?'). The code for the else part loops over pre and next, but in the current code, the loop over pre is missing. \n\nLet me correct the second_program function:\n\nIn the else case (current_char is not '?'):\n\nfor (int pre = 0; pre < 13; pre++) {\n    int next = current_char - '0';\n    int new_mod = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n    dp[i][new_mod] = (dp[i][new_mod] + (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre ==0 ?1 :0))) % MOD;\n}\n\nWait, but the code in the Java version for the else case is:\n\nfor (int pre = 0; pre < 13; ++pre) {\n    dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] +=\n        (i > 0 ? dp[i - 1][pre] : (pre == 0 ? 1 : 0));\n    dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] %= MOD;\n}\n\nSo in C, the code should be:\n\nfor (int pre = 0; pre < 13; pre++) {\n    int new_mod = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n    dp[i][new_mod] = (dp[i][new_mod] + (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre ==0 ?1 :0))) % MOD;\n}\n\nSo the corrected second_program function:\n\nlong long second_program(const char *input_str) {\n    int len = strlen(input_str);\n    long long MOD = 1e9 +7;\n    long long dp[len][13];\n    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));\n\n    int base = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        int current_char = input_str[len - 1 - i];\n        // Initialize dp[i][pre] to previous values?\n        // Wait, the Java code initializes dp[i][...] based on previous steps.\n        // The Java code's loop for each i starts with a new dp[i] array, then updates it.\n\n        // So in C, for each i, we need to initialize the current dp[i] to 0, then process.\n\n        // Wait, the Java code's dp is initialized as new long[...][13], so each row starts at 0.\n\n        // So in C, for each i, we can reset the dp[i] array to 0 before processing.\n\n        // Wait, the code in Java does not reset the dp[i] array each time.
