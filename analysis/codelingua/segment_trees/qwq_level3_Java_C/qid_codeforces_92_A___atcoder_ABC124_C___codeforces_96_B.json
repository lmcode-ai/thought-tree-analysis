So the C program will have functions for each step's processing. Let me outline the steps in code. First, the first Java program's logic in C:\n\nFunction to compute the first's result:\n\nint compute_first(int n, int k) {\n\n    int i = 1, req = 1;\n\n    while (k - req >=0) {\n\n        k -= req;\n\n        i++; if (i % n ! =0) { req = i %n;\n\n        } else {\n\n            req =n;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return k;\n\n} Wait, but in the original code, after subtracting req from k, the loop continues. The loop condition is while (k - req >=0). Wait, the code in Java is:\n\nwhile (k - req >=0) {\n\n   if (k - req >=0) { ... }\n\n   else break;\n\n   i++;\n\n   ... \n\n} Wait, the loop condition is the same as the inner check, so the inner check is redundant. So the loop runs as long as (k - req) is >=0. So the code can be simplified to:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   if (k - req <0) break; k -= req;\n\n   i++;\n\n   req = (i %n ==0) ? n : i%n;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after subtracting req, then i is incremented, then req is updated. So the loop is:\n\nInitially, req is 1, i is 1. Loop:\n\nCheck if k - req >=0. If yes, subtract req from k, then i increments, then compute new req based on new i.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (k - req >=0) { ... } else break;\n\nBut the loop condition is already checking that. So the code is redundant, but the logic is:\n\nEach iteration:\n\n- Check if k - req is >=0.",

Loop while (k - req >=0):\n\nInside the loop, subtract req from k. Then i increments. Then req is set to i mod n, but if i mod n is 0, then req is n. So req is essentially i mod n, but if mod is zero, it's n. So req is (i % n) if not zero, else n.

Hmm, maybe I need to re-express the code. Wait, the code:\n\nmask starts at 2, then increments each time (mask++). The binary string is of mask, then substring(1) is taken.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_92_A) reads two integers n and k from input. It then calculates some value and outputs the remaining k after processing. The second file (atcoder_ABC124_C) takes a string input, processes it in two ways to count the minimum changes needed to make adjacent characters different, and outputs that minimum. The third file (codeforces_96_B) reads a number, finds a specific 4 and 7 combination, and outputs that number.\n\nThe key is that the output of each Java program is the input to the next. So the first's output is the input for the second, and the second's output is the input for the third. But in the C program, I have to chain them without I/O in the middle steps.\n\nWait, but the problem says the entire sequence must be translated into a single C program. So the first program's input is read via stdin, then its output is passed to the second's processing, then the second's output to the third's processing, and finally the third's output is printed. All in one C program.\n\nHmm, so I need to:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n and k) from stdin.\n2. Compute the first's result (the printed k after processing).\n3. Use that result as the input for the second Java program. But the second expects a string input. Wait, the second Java program's input is a string (from in.next()), so the first's output (the printed k) is a number, but the second expects a string. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is the value of k after processing, which is printed. The second Java program's input is a string (since it reads x = in.next(); which is a string). So the first's output (a number) must be the input to the second. But the second expects a string. So perhaps the first's output is a string? Wait, no. The first program's output is System.out.println(k); which is an integer. So the second program's input is that integer as a string? Or maybe the first's output is a string? Wait, no. The first program's output is an integer, so the second program's input is that integer as a string? Like, if the first outputs 123, then the second's input is \"123\".\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code is taking a string input. So the first's output (the printed k) is the input to the second. So the first's output is a number, but the second expects a string. So the second program's input is the first's output as a string. For example, if the first outputs 5, then the second's input is \"5\".\n\nThen the second program's output is the minimum of a1 and a2, which is an integer. The third program's input is that integer, but the third expects a long number. Wait, the third Java program's input is a long number. So the second's output (the min) is the input to the third. So the third's input is that number as a string, which is parsed as a long.\n\nWait, but the third program's code is:\n\nlong number = in.nextLong();\n\nSo the third program's input is a number (the second's output) as a string. So the sequence is:\n\nInput to first: n and k (two integers)\nFirst's output: an integer (the remaining k)\nSecond's input: that integer as a string (so the input is a single line with that number)\nSecond's output: an integer (the min of a1 and a2)\nThird's input: that integer as a string (so input is a single line with that number)\nThird's output: the found value (like 447 or something)\n\nSo the C program must read the initial input (n and k), process through all three steps, and output the third's result.\n\nNow, the challenge is to translate each Java program into C functions, passing data between them without I/O in the middle.\n\nLet me break down each Java program's logic.\n\nFirst Java program (codeforces_92_A):\n\nThe code reads n and k. Then it has a loop where it subtracts req from k until it can't. The req starts at 1, and increments each step, but wraps around modulo n. The loop continues until k - req is negative. The final k is printed.\n\nWait, let me retrace the code:\n\nInitialize i=1, req=1.\n\nLoop while (k - req >=0):\n\nInside the loop, subtract req from k. Then i increments. Then req is set to i mod n, but if i mod n is 0, then req is n. So req is essentially i mod n, but if mod is zero, it's n. So req is (i % n) if not zero, else n. So req is the remainder, but when i is a multiple of n, it's n.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (i % n !=0) req = i%n; else req =n.\n\nSo req is the remainder when i is divided by n, but if it's zero, then it's n. So for example, if n=3, then when i=3, req is 3, when i=4, req is 1 (4 mod3 is 1), etc.\n\nThe loop continues as long as k - req is >=0. Each iteration subtracts req from k, then increments i. The loop breaks when k - req is negative. The final k is printed.\n\nSo the first program's output is the remaining k after this process.\n\nSecond Java program (atcoder_ABC124_C):\n\nThe input is a string x. The code processes it in two ways:\n\nFirst, for a (a copy of x), iterate from left to right. Whenever two adjacent characters are the same, change the current character to the opposite (0 to 1 or vice versa), and count the changes (a1).\n\nSecond, for b (another copy of x), iterate from right to left. Whenever two adjacent are same, change the previous character to opposite, count a2.\n\nThe output is the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nWait, the code for a:\n\nfor i from 1 to length-1:\n\nif a[i] == a[i-1], then flip it, increment a1.\n\nSo this is processing left to right, changing the current character when duplicates are found.\n\nFor b, it's processing from the end backwards. For each i from length-1 downto 1:\n\nif b[i] == b[i-1], then flip the previous character (i-1), increment a2.\n\nWait, in the code for b:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--):\n\nif (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)), then flip the previous (i-1) character.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n   if (b.charAt(i-1) is '1', set to '0', else '1'\n\n   a2++;\n\n}\n\nWait, so in this case, they are changing the previous character (i-1) instead of the current. So when moving backward, they check the pair (i-1, i), and if same, they change the left one (i-1) to make them different.\n\nSo the two approaches are different: one changes the current, the other changes the previous. The counts are the number of changes needed in each approach, and the minimum is taken.\n\nThird Java program (codeforces_96_B):\n\nThe input is a number (long). The code is trying to find the smallest number composed of 4 and 7 digits (with equal number of 0s and 1s in its binary representation?) Wait, let me see.\n\nThe code:\n\nlong number = in.nextLong();\n\nans = -1, value =0.\n\nmask starts at 2, and increments each loop.\n\nInside the loop, while value < number:\n\nconvert mask to binary string, then take substring(1) (so removing the first character? Wait, the binary string of mask starts with '1', so substring(1) removes the first character. So for example, mask=2 is '10', substring(1) is '0'.\n\nThen, count the number of zeros in the string. If the number of zeros is not equal to the number of ones (since zeros != (length - zeros)), then skip this mask.\n\nElse, replace 0 with 4, 1 with 7, parse as long, and set value to that. Then, if value is >= number, then ans is that value, and break.\n\nWait, the loop continues until value >= number. The first such value is the answer.\n\nWait, the code is trying to find the smallest number made of 4 and 7 digits (since replacing 0 with 4 and 1 with 7) such that the binary representation (excluding the first character) has equal number of 0s and 1s. The mask starts at 2, and increments each time. The binary string is mask's binary, then substring(1) (so for mask=2 (binary 10), substring(1) is '0'), then check if zeros equal ones (here, 1 zero and 0 ones? So no, so skip. Hmm, maybe I need to re-express the code.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nmask starts at 2, then increments each time (mask++). The binary string is of mask, then substring(1) is taken. So for mask=3 (binary 11), substring(1) is '1', so zeros is 0, length is 1. So zeros (0) is not equal to 1-0 (1), so skip.\n\nWait, the condition is if zeros != (length - zeros). So the zeros must be exactly half the length. So the binary string (after substring) must have equal 0s and 1s.\n\nSo the mask's binary (without first character) must have equal 0s and 1s. Then, the string is converted to 4 and 7, and the value is parsed. The first such value that is >= the input number is the answer.\n\nWait, but the loop is while value < number. So the loop continues until value is found that is >= number. The first such value is the answer. So the code is trying to find the minimal such number (since mask starts at 2 and increments, so the first valid value >= number is the answer).\n\nWait, but the code's loop is:\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   process mask, compute s, check zeros, etc.\n\n   if valid, compute value, then if value >= number, then ans is set to value, and break?\n\nWait, no. The code's loop is a while loop that runs as long as value < number. Wait, but inside the loop, the code is trying to find a value that is >= number? That might not make sense. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nlong ans = -1, value =0;\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nloop:\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   process mask to get s.\n\n   compute zeros.\n\n   if zeros != (length - zeros), continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      s is replaced to 4 and 7, parsed as long, which is value.\n\n   then, mask increments.\n\n}\n\nWait, but the loop condition is while (value < number). So the loop continues as long as value is less than number. But inside the loop, when a valid s is found, the value is set to the parsed number. So if that value is >= number, then the loop will exit, but the ans is set to that value?\n\nWait, the code's loop is a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code inside the loop:\n\nString s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\nint zeros = 0;\n\nfor each char in s.toCharArray():\n\n   if c is '0', zeros++\n\nif zeros != (s.length() - zeros) \u2192 continue.\n\nElse:\n\n   s is replaced to 4 and 7 \u2192 becomes a string of 4 and 7.\n\n   value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n}\n\nWait, but after that, mask is incremented (because mask++ is in the string conversion). So the loop continues until value is no longer less than number. Wait, but the loop is while (value < number). So once a value is found that is >= number, the loop stops. But the code's ans is set to -1, and the value is set to the parsed s. So the final ans is the first value that is >= number, but how is that stored?\n\nWait, the code's ans is initialized to -1, but in the loop, when a valid s is found, the value is set to the parsed s. The loop continues until value is no longer less than number. So the loop will exit when value >= number. Then, the code prints value. Wait, the code's last line is System.out.println(value); So the ans variable is not used. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nWait, the code:\n\nlong ans = -1, value = 0;\n\nmask = 2;\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   ... process mask to get s.\n\n   if valid:\n\n      s \u2192 converted to 4/7 \u2192 value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n   mask++;\n\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, it prints value.\n\nWait, so the loop runs as long as value is less than number. So when a valid s is found, the value is set to that parsed number. If that value is >= number, then the loop condition (value < number) is false, so the loop stops, and the value is printed. So the code is trying to find the first such value (starting from mask=2 upwards) that is >= the input number. The first such value is the answer.\n\nWait, but the mask is incremented each time, so the first valid value that is >= number is the answer. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to translate all three into C, with the first reading input, the second and third processing without I/O, and the last outputting.\n\nSo the steps in C:\n\n1. Read n and k from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the remaining k after processing).\n\n3. Use that result as the input to the second program's processing (the string is the first's output as a string).\n\n4. The second program's output is the minimum of a1 and a2 (an integer).\n\n5. Use that integer as the input to the third program (as a string).\n\n6. The third program's output is the found value (the minimal 4/7 number >= the input).\n\nNow, in C, I need to:\n\n- Read n and k from stdin.\n\n- Compute the first's result (k_remaining).\n\n- Convert that to a string (since the second program's input is a string).\n\n- Process that string through the second's logic to get the min (an integer).\n\n- Convert that min to a string (since the third program's input is a number as a string).\n\n- Process that through the third's logic to get the final value.\n\n- Output that final value.\n\nSo the C program will have functions for each step's processing.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's logic in C:\n\nFunction to compute the first's result:\n\nint compute_first(int n, int k) {\n\n    int i = 1, req = 1;\n\n    while (k - req >=0) {\n\n        k -= req;\n\n        i++;\n\n        if (i % n !=0) {\n\n            req = i %n;\n\n        } else {\n\n            req =n;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return k;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after subtracting req from k, the loop continues. The loop condition is while (k - req >=0). Wait, the code in Java is:\n\nwhile (k - req >=0) {\n\n   if (k - req >=0) { ... }\n\n   else break;\n\n   i++;\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nWait, the loop condition is the same as the inner check, so the inner check is redundant. So the loop runs as long as (k - req) is >=0. So the code can be simplified to:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   if (k - req <0) break;\n\n   k -= req;\n\n   i++;\n\n   req = (i %n ==0) ? n : i%n;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after subtracting req, then i is incremented, then req is updated. So the loop is:\n\nInitially, req is 1, i is 1.\n\nLoop:\n\nCheck if k - req >=0. If yes, subtract req from k, then i increments, then compute new req based on new i.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (k - req >=0) { ... } else break;\n\nBut the loop condition is already checking that. So the code is redundant, but the logic is:\n\nEach iteration:\n\n- Check if k - req is >=0. If not, break.\n\n- Subtract req from k.\n\n- Increment i.\n\n- Compute new req based on new i.\n\nSo the loop continues until the next req would make k - req negative.\n\nSo the C function would be:\n\nint compute_first(int n, int k) {\n\n    int i = 1, req = 1;\n\n    while (true) {\n\n        if (k - req < 0) break;\n\n        k -= req;\n\n        i++;\n\n        if (i % n !=0) {\n\n            req = i %n;\n\n        } else {\n\n            req =n;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return k;\n\n}\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNext, the second program's processing. The input is a string (the first's output as a string). The output is the minimum between a1 and a2.\n\nSo the function would take a string (char array) and return the minimum.\n\nFunction signature: int compute_second(const char *x_str).\n\nWait, the input is a string (the first's output, which is an integer, so the string is like \"123\").\n\nThe function needs to process the string as per the second Java program.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nThe code for the second program:\n\nTake the input string x.\n\nMake two copies (a and b).\n\nProcess a from left to right, changing current character when duplicates are found, count a1.\n\nProcess b from right to left, changing previous character when duplicates are found, count a2.\n\nReturn min(a1, a2).\n\nIn C, I can represent the strings as arrays.\n\nImplementing the a processing:\n\nInitialize a as a copy of x.\n\na1 =0.\n\nfor (i from 1 to len-1):\n\n   if a[i] == a[i-1], then flip it (0 <->1), increment a1.\n\nWait, but the original code uses a StringBuilder, so in C, perhaps we can use a char array.\n\nSimilarly for b.\n\nWait, the code for a:\n\nfor (int i=1; i < x.length(); i++) {\n\n   if (a[i] == a[i-1]) {\n\n      flip a[i], a1++;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, in the code, the flip is done on the current character (a[i]). So for example, if it's '1', set to '0', else '1'.\n\nSimilarly for b, but processing from the end:\n\nfor (i from len-1 downto 1):\n\n   if (b[i] == b[i-1]):\n\n      flip b[i-1], a2++;\n\nSo in C:\n\nFunction compute_second:\n\nint compute_second(const char *x_str) {\n\n    int len = strlen(x_str);\n\n    char a[len+1], b[len+1];\n\n    strcpy(a, x_str);\n\n    strcpy(b, x_str);\n\n    int a1=0, a2=0;\n\n    // process a left to right\n\n    for (int i=1; i < len; i++) {\n\n        if (a[i] == a[i-1]) {\n\n            if (a[i] == '1') a[i] = '0';\n\n            else a[i] = '1';\n\n            a1++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // process b right to left\n\n    for (int i = len-1; i >0; i--) {\n\n        if (b[i] == b[i-1]) {\n\n            if (b[i-1] == '1') b[i-1] = '0';\n\n            else b[i-1] = '1';\n\n            a2++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return (a1 < a2) ? a1 : a2;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the second loop for b, the code checks if b[i] == b[i-1], then flips the previous (i-1) character. So the code is correct here.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nThird program's processing: takes the second's output (an integer, which is the min between a1 and a2) as input, which is a number. The third program's input is that number as a string. The output is the minimal 4/7 number >= that input.\n\nWait, the third program's input is a long number. So the input to the third is the second's output (the min) as a string. So the third's input is the string representation of that integer.\n\nThe third program's code is to find the minimal number made of 4 and 7 digits (with equal 0s and 1s in the binary substring) that is >= the input number.\n\nSo the function for the third program would take the input as a string (the second's output as a string), parse it to a long, then compute the required value.\n\nFunction signature: long compute_third(const char *input_str).\n\nImplementing this in C:\n\nFirst, parse the input_str to a long number.\n\nThen, the algorithm is similar to the Java code.\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nmask starts at 2, increments each time.\n\nFor each mask:\n\nconvert to binary string, substring(1) \u2192 so the binary string of mask, then take substring starting at index 1 (so remove the first character).\n\nCheck if the number of zeros in this substring is equal to the number of ones.\n\nIf yes, then replace 0 with 4, 1 with 7 \u2192 get a string, parse to long, and if this value is >= the input number, then return it as the answer.\n\nThe loop continues until such a value is found.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is while (value < number). Wait, the code's loop is:\n\nlong ans = -1, value =0;\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n   process mask to get s.\n\n   if valid:\n\n      value = parsed s.\n\n   mask++;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the loop continues until value is no longer less than number. So the first valid value that is >= number is the answer. Because once value is set to a valid value >= number, the loop condition (value < number) is false, so the loop exits, and the value is printed.\n\nSo in C, the function would need to:\n\nParse the input_str to a long (number).\n\nInitialize mask starting at 2.\n\nLoop:\n\nfor (mask =2; ; mask++) {\n\n   compute the binary string of mask, then substring(1).\n\n   check if the zeros count equals the ones count.\n\n   if yes:\n\n      create the 4/7 string, parse to value.\n\n      if value >= number \u2192 return value.\n\n}\n\nWait, but how to handle the loop? Since mask can be large, but in practice, the code will find a valid mask eventually.\n\nSo the steps in C:\n\nFunction compute_third:\n\nlong compute_third(const char *input_str) {\n\n    long number = atol(input_str); // but need to parse as long, maybe use strtol.\n\n    // parse input_str to number:\n\n    char *endptr;\n\n    long num = strtol(input_str, &endptr, 10);\n\n    if (endptr == input_str || *endptr != '\\0') {\n\n        // error, but assuming input is correct.\n\n    }\n\n    number = num;\n\n    long value;\n\n    int mask =2;\n\n    while (1) {\n\n        // convert mask to binary string.\n\n        char bin_str[64]; // enough for 64-bit mask.\n\n        int len;\n\n        // convert mask to binary.\n\n        // using sprintf with %b? but C doesn't have %b.\n\n        // need to implement binary conversion.\n\n        // function to convert integer to binary string.\n\n        // let's write a helper function.\n\n        // helper function to get binary string of mask, then substring(1).\n\n        // first, get the binary string of mask.\n\n        char bin[64];\n\n        int i =0;\n\n        int m = mask;\n\n        if (m ==0) bin[0]='0', bin[1]=0;\n\n        else {\n\n            while (m >0) {\n\n                bin[i++] = (m%2)+'0';\n\n                m /=2;\n\n            }\n\n            bin[i] =0;\n\n            // reverse the string.\n\n            for (int j=0, k=i-1; j<k; j++,k--){\n\n                char t = bin[j];\n\n                bin[j] = bin[k];\n\n                bin[k] = t;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        // now, the binary string is bin.\n\n        // substring(1) \u2192 skip first character.\n\n        char s[64];\n\n        if (strlen(bin) <1) {\n\n            // mask is 0, but mask starts at 2, so this won't happen.\n\n            s[0] =0;\n\n        } else {\n\n            strncpy(s, bin+1, strlen(bin)-1);\n\n            s[strlen(bin)-1] =0;\n\n        }\n\n        // count zeros and ones.\n\n        int zeros =0;\n\n        for (int j=0; s[j]; j++) {\n\n            if (s[j] == '0') zeros++;\n\n        }\n\n        int len_s = strlen(s);\n\n        if (zeros != (len_s - zeros)) {\n\n            // not equal, continue.\n\n            mask++;\n\n            continue;\n\n        }\n\n        // now, replace 0 with 4, 1 with7.\n\n        char s2[64];\n\n        strcpy(s2, s);\n\n        for (int j=0; s2[j]; j++) {\n\n            if (s2[j] == '0') s2[j] = '4';\n\n            else s2[j] = '7';\n\n        }\n\n        // parse to long.\n\n        value = strtol(s2, &endptr, 10);\n\n        if (value >= number) {\n\n            return value;\n\n        }\n\n        mask++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the loop, after processing mask, if the condition is met, we check if value >= number. If yes, return it. Else, continue.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after generating s2 and parsing to value, if value is >= number, return it. Else, mask is incremented and loop continues.\n\nWait, but the loop is infinite until a valid value is found. So the code will eventually find one.\n\nBut in the code above, after checking, if the value is not enough, we do mask++ and continue. Wait, no, in the code above, after the 'continue' in the zeros != case, mask is not incremented. Wait, let me see:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nInside the loop:\n\ncompute bin_str for mask.\n\nthen check zeros.\n\nif not equal \u2192 continue; \u2192 which skips to the next iteration, so mask is not incremented here.
