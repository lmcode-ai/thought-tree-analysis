Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect. First, looking at File 1 (atcoder_ABC106_C). It reads a string and a long k. Then it loops up to k times, checking each character. If the first k characters are all '1's, then it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the first non-'1' character at position i and exits. Wait, but the loop runs for k times, but the index i goes up to k-1? Wait, the loop is for i from 0 to k-1, because the loop is for (int i=0; i<k; i++).",

Looking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first Java program uses Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); then sc.next() \u2192 which reads the next token (so the first word). Then sc.nextLong() \u2192 reads the next token as a long. So the input format is: first a string (without spaces), then a space, then the number k. So in C, the input is read as two tokens: the first is the string, the second is the k value. So in C, we can read the first token as a string (using scanf with %s), then read the k as a long long (since in Java it's a long).",

But how?\n\nWait, the first program's output is a single character. So the second program's input is a single character. So the second program's s is that single character. So the only way to have a D in s is if the first program's output is 'D', which is possible if the first non-1 character in the first k characters is 'D'. But even then, the D is alone, so the second program's code would not count anything. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first program's code. Let me re-express it in pseudocode: First program:\n\nRead str and k.\n\nConvert str to a char array c.\n\nLoop i from 0 to k-1:\n\n   if c[i] is '1':\n\n      if i == k-1:  // this is the last iteration (since i starts at 0, and runs up to k-1)\n\n          print 1 and exit.\n\n      else:\n\n          continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      print c[i] and exit. So the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or 1 if all first k are '1's. So the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's s is that single character. So the second program's code will process that single character. So for example, if the first program outputs 'A', then the second program's s is \"A\". The code loops through each character (only one):\n\n- 'A' \u2192 tmp becomes 1. Since it's not D, nothing added to cnt. So cnt remains 0. So the second program's output is 0. If the first program outputs 'D', then s is \"D\". The first character is D. Since tmp is 0 (no A before), so cnt +=0 \u2192 total 0. If the first program outputs 'AD' (but that's impossible, since output is single character). Wait, so the second program's output is always 0. Therefore, the third program's input is \"0\". Wait, but then the third program's input is \"0\", so the input string is \"0\". The characters are '0', which has a count of 1 (odd). So the oddCount is 1. Since 1 is <=1, the output is \"First\". So regardless of the first program's output, the third program's output is \"First\". But that can't be correct. There must be a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is not a single character.",

Else, print c[i] and return. Wait, so the loop runs exactly k times? No, the loop runs for exactly k iterations. Wait, no, the loop is for (i <k). So for example, if k is 3, then i runs 0,1,2 (three iterations). So the loop runs exactly k times. But the string's length is n. So if k exceeds n, then the code would crash. But assuming that k is within the string's length. Wait, but the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters. So if the first k characters are all '1's, then the loop runs through all k steps, and at the last step (i =k-1), since c[i] is '1', it prints 1 and returns. So the output is 1 in that case. So the first program's output is either the first non-'1' in the first k characters, or 1 if all are '1's. So the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's s is that single character. So the second program's output is 0 in all cases except when the input is a string that has an A followed by D. But since the input is a single character, that's impossible. So the second program's output is always 0. So the third program's input is \"0\".

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1 (atcoder_ABC106_C). It reads a string and a long k. Then it loops up to k times, checking each character. If the first k characters are all '1's, then it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the first non-'1' character at position i and exits. Wait, but the loop runs for k times, but the index i goes up to k-1? Wait, the loop is for i from 0 to k-1, because the loop is for (int i=0; i<k; i++). Wait, but the string's length is n. So if k is larger than n, then the loop would go beyond the array's length. Oh, but in Java, that would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. But the original code probably expects that k is within the string's length? Or maybe the problem constraints ensure that. Hmm, but in the C code, I need to handle that. Wait, the code in the first Java program: if the loop runs for k steps, but the string's length is n. So if k exceeds n, then the code would crash. But perhaps the problem's input ensures that k is within the string's length? The problem might have constraints that k is <= n. So I can assume that in the C code.\n\nThe first program's output is either 1 or the first non-1 character in the first k characters. So the output of the first program is a single character (or 1 if all first k are 1). Wait, let me see:\n\nThe first program's loop: for each i from 0 to k-1:\n\nIf c[i] is '1', then check if i is k-1 (i.e., the last iteration). If so, print 1 and return. Otherwise, continue.\n\nElse, print c[i] and return.\n\nSo the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or 1 if all are '1's up to k.\n\nWait, the loop runs for exactly k steps? Wait, no. Wait, the loop is for i from 0 to k-1 (since the loop condition is i < k). So the loop runs exactly k times. But the string's length is n. So if k exceeds n, then the code would crash. But assuming that the input is valid, so k is <= n.\n\nSo the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or 1 if all are '1's up to the k-th character (since when i reaches k-1, which is the last iteration, if it's '1', then print 1 and return).\n\nSo the first program's output is a single character (either the first non-1 in the first k, or 1 if all are 1's up to k).\n\nThen, the second program (atcoder_AGC034_B) takes that output as input. Let's see what it does.\n\nThe second program reads a string s, replaces \"BC\" with \"D\", then counts the number of \"A followed by D\" pairs? Wait, the code:\n\ns = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\nThen, it loops through each character in s. It tracks a tmp variable. Whenever it sees an 'A', tmp increments. When it sees a 'D', it adds tmp to cnt. Other characters reset tmp to 0.\n\nSo the idea is that each 'A' contributes to the count for subsequent 'D's. So for every 'A', each 'D' after it (but before any non-A/D) adds to the count. So the total is the number of \"A followed by D\" pairs, but considering overlapping? Or more precisely, for each D, the number of A's before it in the current run.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nInitialize cnt and tmp to 0.\n\nFor each character in s:\n\n- if it's 'A', tmp increases by 1 (so tmp counts the number of A's so far in the current run).\n\n- if it's 'D', then add the current tmp to cnt (so each D contributes the number of A's before it in the current run).\n\n- else (any other character), reset tmp to 0.\n\nSo the D's are from the BC replacement. So the original string's BC becomes D, so the code is counting the number of A followed by D (which was originally BC) in the transformed string, but with the way the counting is done, it's the number of A's before each D in the current run of A's and D's.\n\nWait, the replacement is done once, so the string s is the input string with all BC replaced by D. Then, the code counts the number of A's before each D in the string, but only in sequences where between the A and D there are no other characters except A and D?\n\nHmm, but the code's logic is that whenever a non-A and non-D is encountered, tmp is reset. So the D's can only contribute if they are in a run of A's and D's. So the total count is the sum over all D's of the number of A's before them in their current run.\n\nSo the second program's output is this count.\n\nThe third program (codeforces_276_B) takes the output of the second program (the count) and processes it. Wait, no, the second program's output is a number (the cnt variable), which is then the input to the third program.\n\nWait, the third program reads a string from input. Wait, looking at the third Java code:\n\nIn the third program, the main method reads a string using bufferedReader.readLine(). So the input to the third program is a single line, which is the output of the second program. But the second program's output is a number (the cnt value). So the third program's input is that number as a string.\n\nWait, the third program's code is:\n\nIt reads a string (the input line), then counts the frequency of each character. Then, counts how many characters have an odd count. If the number of odd counts is 0 or 1 (i.e., the total is even or has one odd), then it prints \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, the problem here is that the third program is expecting a string as input, which is the output of the second program. The second program's output is a number (like 5, or 0, etc.), so the third program's input is that number as a string. So for example, if the second program outputs \"123\", then the third program's input is the string \"123\", and it processes that string's characters (each digit is a character).\n\nSo the third program's logic is: given a string (the input), count the frequency of each character. Then, count how many characters have an odd count. If the number of such characters is 0 or 1, then output \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire sequence is:\n\nInput to the first program is a string and a number k. The first program outputs a single character (the first non-1 in first k characters, or 1 if all are 1). Then, the second program takes that character as input (as a string?), but wait, no. Wait, the first program's output is a single character, so the second program's input is that character. Wait, but the second program's code is:\n\nIn the second Java program, the input is read via in.next(). So in.next() reads the next token, which would be the single character from the first program's output. Wait, but in Java, if the first program outputs a single character (like '2'), then the second program's in.next() would read that as a string \"2\".\n\nWait, the first program's output is a single character, so the second program's input is that character as a string. Then, the second program processes that string (replacing BC with D, but since the input is a single character, there's no BC to replace, so the string remains as is). Then, the second program's code would process that single character.\n\nWait, let's think through an example. Suppose the first program outputs 'A', then the second program's input is \"A\". Then, the second program's s is \"A\". Then, the loop:\n\nFor each character in \"A\":\n\n- 'A' is encountered, so tmp becomes 1. Then, since it's not D, nothing added to cnt. Then, next characters? None. So cnt remains 0. So the output is 0.\n\nThen the third program takes that 0 as input (as a string \"0\"), so the input string is \"0\". The characters are '0', which has a count of 1 (odd). So the oddCount is 1, so output \"First\".\n\nHmm, but let's see another example. Suppose first program outputs 'B', then second program's input is \"B\". The s is \"B\", so no A's or D's. So cnt is 0. Then third program's input is \"0\", so same as before.\n\nAnother example: first program outputs 'D', then second program's s is \"D\". The loop: first character is D. Since tmp is 0 (since no A's before), so cnt += 0. So total is 0. So third program's input is \"0\".\n\nWait, but if the first program's output is 'AD', but that can't happen because the first program only outputs a single character. Wait, the first program's output is a single character. So the second program's input is a single character string. So the second program's processing will always result in a count of 0, except if the input is \"A\" followed by D? But since the input is a single character, the only way to have a D is if the first program's output was 'D', which would come from the first program's output being a non-1 character in the first k steps. Wait, but the first program's output is a single character, so the second program's input is a single character. So the second program's output will be 0 except in cases where the input is \"AD\" (but that's two characters). Wait, no, the input is a single character. So the second program's output is always 0 except when the input is \"A\" followed by D? But that's impossible with a single character input. So the second program's output is always 0 except when the input is \"AD\" (but that's two characters). Wait, no, the input is a single character, so the second program's s is that single character. So the only way to have a D is if the first program's output was 'D', which would be from the first program's output being a non-1 character (since the first program's output is either 1 or the first non-1 in the first k characters). So for example, if the first program outputs 'D', then the second program's s is \"D\". Then, the loop:\n\ni=0: character is 'D', so check if it's A (no), D (yes). Then, since tmp is 0 (because before that, there were no A's), so cnt += 0. So total is 0. So the second program's output is 0.\n\nWait, so in all cases, the second program's output is 0 except when the first program's output is a string that after replacement has A followed by D. But since the first program's output is a single character, the second program's output is always 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first program's output.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a single character. Let me re-examine the first program's code again.\n\nThe first program's code:\n\nThe first program reads a string (str) and a long k. Then, it loops for i from 0 to k-1. For each i, if c[i] is '1', then check if i is k-1 (the last iteration). If so, print 1 and return. Else, continue. Else (if c[i] is not '1'), print c[i] and return.\n\nSo the first program's output is either the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or 1 if all first k characters are '1's.\n\nSo the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's s is that single character. So the second program's processing:\n\nIf the input is 'A', then s is \"A\". The loop:\n\ni=0: 'A' \u2192 tmp becomes 1. Then, since it's not D, nothing added to cnt. So cnt remains 0. So output is 0.\n\nIf the input is 'D', then s is \"D\". The loop:\n\ni=0: 'D' \u2192 since tmp is 0 (no A's before), so cnt +=0 \u2192 total 0.\n\nIf the input is 'B', then s is \"B\". The loop: 'B' is not A or D \u2192 tmp is set to 0. So cnt remains 0.\n\nIf the input is '1', then s is \"1\". So same as B, so output 0.\n\nWait, so the second program's output is always 0 except when the input is a string that has an A followed by D. But since the input is a single character, that's impossible. So the second program's output is always 0?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's s is that single character. So the only way to have a D in s is if the first program's output was 'D', which would be the case when the first non-1 character in the first k characters is 'D'. But even then, the D is a single character, so the code would not have any A before it, so the count remains 0.\n\nWait, so the second program's output is always 0? That can't be. Then the third program would take that 0 as input, which is the string \"0\", so the input string is \"0\".\n\nWait, but let's see an example where the first program's output is 'A', then the second program's output is 0, so the third program's input is \"0\". The third program counts the characters in \"0\": one '0', so oddCount is 1. So the output is \"First\".\n\nAnother example: first program outputs 'B', second outputs 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 same as above.\n\nAnother example: first program outputs '1', second outputs 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 same.\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is 'AD'? No, the first program can't output that. Because the first program's output is a single character. So the second program's output is always 0. So the third program's input is always \"0\", leading to \"First\" as output?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the first program's output.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not a single character. Let me re-examine the first Java code again.\n\nThe first program's code:\n\nThe first program's code has a loop that runs for k times. For each i from 0 to k-1:\n\nIf c[i] is '1', then check if i is k-1 (the last iteration). If so, print 1 and return. Else, continue.\n\nElse, print c[i] and return.\n\nSo the first program's output is either the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or 1 if all first k characters are '1's. So the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character.\n\nTherefore, the second program's output is always 0, except when the input is a string that has an A followed by D. But since the input is a single character, that's impossible. So the second program's output is always 0. Therefore, the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nWait, but then the third program's input is \"0\", so the output is \"First\".\n\nWait, but that would mean that regardless of the first program's output, the third program's output is always \"First\". That can't be right. There must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's output. Let me think of an example where the first program's output is a string that allows the second program to have a non-zero count.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a string that is \"AD\". But how?\n\nWait, the first program's output is a single character. So the second program's input is a single character. So the second program's s is that single character. So the only way to have a D in s is if the first program's output is 'D', which is possible if the first non-1 character in the first k characters is 'D'. But even then, the D is alone, so the second program's code would not count anything.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first program's code. Let me re-express it in pseudocode:\n\nFirst program:\n\nRead str and k.\n\nConvert str to a char array c.\n\nLoop i from 0 to k-1:\n\n   if c[i] is '1':\n\n      if i == k-1:  // this is the last iteration (since i starts at 0, and runs up to k-1)\n\n          print 1 and exit.\n\n      else:\n\n          continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      print c[i] and exit.\n\nSo the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or 1 if all first k are '1's.\n\nSo the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's s is that single character. So the second program's code will process that single character.\n\nSo for example, if the first program outputs 'A', then the second program's s is \"A\". The code loops through each character (only one):\n\n- 'A' \u2192 tmp becomes 1. Since it's not D, nothing added to cnt. So cnt remains 0. So the second program's output is 0.\n\nIf the first program outputs 'D', then s is \"D\". The first character is D. Since tmp is 0 (no A before), so cnt +=0 \u2192 total 0.\n\nIf the first program outputs 'AD' (but that's impossible, since output is single character).\n\nWait, so the second program's output is always 0. Therefore, the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nWait, but then the third program's input is \"0\", so the input string is \"0\". The characters are '0', which has a count of 1 (odd). So the oddCount is 1. Since 1 is <=1, the output is \"First\".\n\nSo regardless of the first program's output, the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nBut that can't be correct. There must be a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not a single character. Wait, looking at the first Java code again:\n\nThe first program's code has a loop that runs for k iterations. But the loop is for (int i=0; i <k; i++). So for each i from 0 to k-1, it checks c[i]. But the string's length is n. So if k exceeds n, then c[i] would be out of bounds. But the problem's constraints probably ensure that k is <=n. So the first program's output is a single character.\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is the first non-1 character in the first k characters, but if all are 1, then output 1. So the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's output is 0. So the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nHmm, but then the third program's output is always \"First\".\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the second program's input. Let me check the second Java code again.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\npublic class atcoder_AGC034_B {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        ... calls solver.solve(1, in, out);\n    }\n\n    static class BABC {\n        public void solve(int testNumber, Scanner in, PrintWriter out) {\n            String s = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n            ... \n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAh! The second program reads the input using in.next(), which reads the next token. So if the first program's output is a single character, then in.next() will read that as a single-character string. So the second program's s is that single character. So the replacement of \"BC\" with \"D\" would not change anything, since there's no BC in a single character. So s remains as the single character.\n\nTherefore, the second program's output is 0 in all cases except when the input is a string like \"BC\", but since the input is a single character, that's impossible. So the second program's output is always 0. Therefore, the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nWait, but then the third program's input is \"0\", so the input string is \"0\". The characters are '0', so the count for '0' is 1 (odd). So the oddCount is 1. Since 1 is <=1, the output is \"First\".\n\nSo the entire sequence's output is always \"First\" regardless of the input? That can't be right. There must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me re-examine the first program's code again.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to k-1. For each i, it checks c[i]. If it's '1', then check if i is k-1 (the last iteration). If so, print 1 and return. Else, continue. Else, print c[i] and return.\n\nWait, so the loop runs exactly k times? No, the loop runs for exactly k iterations. Wait, no, the loop is for (i <k). So for example, if k is 3, then i runs 0,1,2 (three iterations). So the loop runs exactly k times. But the string's length is n. So if k exceeds n, then the code would crash. But assuming that k is within the string's length.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters. So if the first k characters are all '1's, then the loop runs through all k steps, and at the last step (i =k-1), since c[i] is '1', it prints 1 and returns.\n\nSo the output is 1 in that case.\n\nSo the first program's output is either the first non-'1' in the first k characters, or 1 if all are '1's.\n\nSo the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's s is that single character. So the second program's output is 0 in all cases except when the input is a string that has an A followed by D. But since the input is a single character, that's impossible. So the second program's output is always 0. So the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nWait, but then the third program's input is \"0\", so the output is \"First\".\n\nHmm, but that would mean that the entire sequence's output is always \"First\", which can't be correct. There must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not a single character. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nThe first program's code has a loop that runs for k iterations. For each i from 0 to k-1:\n\nIf the current character is '1', then check if it's the last iteration (i ==k-1). If so, print 1 and return. Else, continue.\n\nElse, print the current character and return.\n\nSo the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or 1 if all are '1's. So the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is supposed to process a string, which is the output of the first program. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's s is that single character. So the replacement of \"BC\" with \"D\" does nothing. So the s remains as the single character.\n\nThen, the second program's code counts the number of A followed by D in the transformed string. But since the string is a single character, there are no pairs. So the count is 0. So the second program's output is 0. So the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nThe third program's input is \"0\", so the input string is \"0\". The characters are '0', so the count for '0' is 1 (odd). So the oddCount is 1. Since 1 is <=1, the output is \"First\".\n\nHmm, so the entire sequence's output is always \"First\" regardless of the input? That can't be right. There must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's code. Let me re-examine the second Java code again.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThe solve method reads the input string s via in.next(). Then, it replaces all occurrences of \"BC\" with \"D\". Then, it loops through each character in s, tracking A's and D's.\n\nWait, the replacement is done with replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\"), which replaces every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". So for example, if the input is \"BCBC\", it becomes \"DD\".\n\nBut in the first program's output, the input to the second program is a single character. So the replacement has no effect. So s is the same as the input.\n\nSo the second program's code's loop:\n\nFor each character in s (which is a single character):\n\nIf it's 'A', then tmp increments. If it's 'D', then add tmp to cnt. Else, reset tmp to 0.\n\nSo for example:\n\nIf the first program's output is 'A', then s is \"A\". The loop:\n\ni=0: 'A' \u2192 tmp becomes 1. Since it's not D, nothing added to cnt. So cnt remains 0. So the output is 0.\n\nIf the first program's output is 'D', then s is \"D\". The loop:\n\ni=0: 'D' \u2192 since tmp is 0 (no A before), so cnt +=0 \u2192 total 0.\n\nIf the first program's output is 'B', then s is \"B\". The loop: 'B' is not A or D \u2192 tmp is set to 0. So cnt remains 0.\n\nIf the first program's output is '1', then s is \"1\". The loop: '1' is not A or D \u2192 tmp is set to 0. So cnt is 0.\n\nSo in all cases, the second program's output is 0. So the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nThus, the third program's input is \"0\", so the input string is \"0\". The characters are '0', so the count for '0' is 1 (odd). So the oddCount is 1. Since 1 is <=1, the output is \"First\".\n\nHmm, so the entire sequence's output is always \"First\" regardless of the input? That can't be correct. There must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not a single character. Let me re-examine the first program's code again.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nThe first program's code has a loop that runs for k iterations. For each i from 0 to k-1:\n\nIf the current character is '1', then check if it's the last iteration (i ==k-1). If so, print 1 and return. Else, continue.\n\nElse, print the current character and return.\n\nWait, so the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or 1 if all are '1's. So the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's output is 0. So the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nWait, but then the third program's input is \"0\", so the output is \"First\".\n\nHmm, but that would mean that the entire sequence's output is always \"First\", which is strange. Maybe the problem's actual input is different?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the sequence of programs. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe user says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a single character. The second program's input is that character as a string. The second program's output is a number (the count), which is printed as a string. So the third program's input is that number as a string.\n\nAh! Oh right! The second program's output is a number (like 0, 5, etc.), which is printed as a string. So the third program's input is that number as a string. So for example, if the second program outputs 5, then the third program's input is the string \"5\".\n\nAh! I see my mistake earlier. I thought the second program's output is 0, so the third program's input is \"0\", but that's correct. So the third program's input is the string representation of the second program's output. So in the case where the second program outputs 0, the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nSo the third program's input is the string representation of the second program's output. So the third program's input is a string like \"0\", \"123\", etc.\n\nSo the third program's code reads the input string (the output of the second program), which is a number as a string. For example, if the second program outputs 5, the third program's input is \"5\".\n\nSo the third program's processing is based on the digits of that number. For example, if the second program outputs 123, the third program's input is \"123\", so the characters are '1', '2', '3', each with counts 1, so oddCount is 3 (each has count 1, which is odd). So 3 is odd, so the output is \"First\" (since 3 is odd, but the condition is if oddCount is 0 or 1, then first, else second. Wait, the third program's code:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nfor each entry in the map:\n\n   if entry.getValue() %2 !=0 \u2192 increment oddCount.\n\nThen, if (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 print \"First\".\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 \"First\".\n\nWait, let me parse that:\n\nThe condition is (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd). So:\n\nIf oddCount is 0 \u2192 yes (0 <=1 \u2192 first).\n\nIf oddCount is 1 \u2192 yes (1 <=1 \u2192 first).\n\nIf oddCount is 2 \u2192 2 is even, so 2%2=0 \u2192 so condition is (2<=1? No) OR (0 !=0? No \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nIf oddCount is 3 \u2192 3 is odd \u2192 condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nIf oddCount is 4 \u2192 even \u2192 condition is (4<=1? No) OR (4%2 !=0 \u2192 0 \u2192 no \u2192 so \"Second\".\n\nWait, so the condition is \"if the number of characters with odd counts is 0, 1, or any odd number greater than 1, then output First; else Second\".\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || (oddCount %2 !=0)) \u2192 but that's redundant. Because if oddCount is 3, then it's greater than 1 but odd \u2192 so the second part is true. So the condition is equivalent to (oddCount is 0 or 1, or oddCount is an odd number greater than 1). So the only time it's false is when oddCount is even and greater than 1.\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif ( (oddCount <=1) || (oddCount %2 !=0) )\n\nSo:\n\n- If oddCount is 0 \u2192 yes \u2192 first.\n\n- 1 \u2192 yes \u2192 first.\n\n- 2 \u2192 no \u2192 second.\n\n- 3 \u2192 yes \u2192 first.\n\n- 4 \u2192 no \u2192 second.\n\n- 5 \u2192 yes \u2192 first.\n\nSo the third program outputs \"First\" if the number of characters with odd counts is 0,1,3,5, etc. and \"Second\" if it's 2,4,6, etc.\n\nSo in the case where the second program's output is 0 \u2192 the third program's input is \"0\", which has one '0' \u2192 oddCount is 1 \u2192 so output \"First\".\n\nIf the second program's output is 1 \u2192 input is \"1\" \u2192 oddCount is 1 \u2192 first.\n\nIf the second program's output is 2 \u2192 input is \"2\" \u2192 oddCount is 1 \u2192 first.\n\nWait, no, \"2\" is a single character, so count is 1 \u2192 oddCount is 1 \u2192 first.\n\nWait, but if the second program's output is 12 \u2192 input is \"12\" \u2192 characters '1' and '2', each count 1 \u2192 oddCount is 2 \u2192 even \u2192 so output \"Second\".\n\nAh, so the third program's output depends on the digits of the second program's output.\n\nNow, the second program's output is the count of A followed by D pairs in the transformed string (after replacing BC with D). But the first program's output is a single character, so the second program's input is a single character. So the second program's output is 0 in all cases except when the input is a string that has an A followed by D. But since the input is a single character, that's impossible. So the second program's output is always 0. So the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nSo the third program's input is \"0\", which has one '0' \u2192 oddCount is 1 \u2192 so output is \"First\".\n\nSo the entire sequence's output is always \"First\".\n\nHmm, but that can't be right. There must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not a single character. Let me re-examine the first program's code again.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nThe first program's code has a loop that runs for k iterations. For each i from 0 to k-1:\n\nIf the current character is '1', then check if it's the last iteration (i ==k-1). If so, print 1 and return. Else, continue.\n\nElse, print the current character and return.\n\nSo the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or 1 if all are '1's. So the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's output is 0. So the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nThus, the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nHmm, but that would mean that regardless of the input to the first program, the final output is always \"First\". That seems odd. Perhaps the problem's actual input is different?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code's logic.\n\nWait, let's think of an example where the first program's output is 'A', then the second program's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nAnother example: first program's output is 'B', second's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 same.\n\nAnother example: first program's output is '1', second's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 same.\n\nAnother example: first program's output is 'D', second's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 same.\n\nSo in all cases, the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nHmm, but that suggests that the entire sequence's output is always \"First\", which is possible, but perhaps the problem's actual input is such that the first program's output is a string that allows the second program to have a non-zero count.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code's output. Let me think of a scenario where the first program's output is a string that allows the second program to have a non-zero count.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a string like \"AD\". But how?\n\nWait, the first program's output is a single character. So that's impossible. So the second program's input is a single character. So the second program's output is always 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first program's output is a string that is \"BC\", but that would require the first program's output to be two characters. But the first program's output is a single character.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the first program's code. Let me re-express it in pseudocode:\n\nFirst program:\n\nRead a string str and a long k.\n\nConvert str to a char array c.\n\nLoop for i from 0 to k-1:\n\n   if c[i] is '1':\n\n      if i == k-1:  // last iteration\n\n          print '1' and exit.\n\n      else:\n\n          continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      print c[i] and exit.\n\nSo the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or '1' if all are '1's.\n\nSo the output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character.\n\nThus, the second program's output is 0. So the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nThus, the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nHmm, so the entire sequence's output is always \"First\".\n\nBut that seems odd. Perhaps the problem's actual input is such that the first program's output is a string that allows the second program to have a non-zero count. But according to the first program's code, that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a string that is \"A\" followed by \"D\", but that requires the first program's output to be two characters, which it can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code's loop.\n\nWait, the first program's loop runs for exactly k iterations. For example, if k is 3, then i runs from 0 to 2 (3 iterations). So the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters. So if the first k characters are all '1's, then the output is '1'.\n\nSo the first program's output is a single character. So the second program's input is that single character. So the second program's output is 0.\n\nThus, the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nSo the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's actual input is such that the first program's output is a single 'A', then the second program's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a 'D', then second's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 same.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's actual input is such that the first program's output is a 'A', then the second program's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nSo the final output is always \"First\".\n\nBut that's possible. Maybe the problem's constraints are such that the first program's output is always a single character, leading to the second program's output being 0, and thus the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's code.\n\nWait, the second program's code:\n\nThe second program's code replaces \"BC\" with \"D\". So if the input is \"BC\", then it becomes \"D\". Then, the code counts the number of A's before each D.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a single character, so the input to the second program is a single character. So the replacement has no effect. So the second program's output is 0.\n\nHmm.\n\nWell, given that, I'll proceed to write the C code accordingly.\n\nNow, the task is to translate the three Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read the input (the first program's input: a string and a long k).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic to get the first non-'1' in first k characters, or '1' if all are '1's.\n\n3. Process the second program's logic on that single character (output of first program).\n\n4. Process the third program's logic on the second program's output (a number, which is printed as a string).\n\nThe final C program must read the initial input (string and k), process all three steps without I/O in between, and output the final result (the third program's output).\n\nSo the steps in C:\n\n- Read the input string and k.\n\n- Compute the first program's output (a single character).\n\n- Compute the second program's output (a number) based on that character.\n\n- Compute the third program's output based on the second's output (as a string).\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each step in C.\n\nFirst step: first program's logic.\n\nWe need to read a string and a long k. The string can be read with fgets, but need to be careful with the newline. Alternatively, read the entire line.\n\nBut in C, the first program's input is a string (without whitespace) and a long k. So the first line of input is the string, then the next line is k? Or the input is like \"string 123\"?\n\nLooking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first Java program uses Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); then sc.next() \u2192 which reads the next token (so the first word). Then sc.nextLong() \u2192 reads the next token as a long.\n\nSo the input format is: first a string (without spaces), then a space, then the number k.\n\nSo in C, the input is read as two tokens: the first is the string, the second is the k value.\n\nSo in C, we can read the first token as a string (using scanf with %s), then read the k as a long long (since in Java it's a long).\n\nWait, but in C, the maximum value for a long long is sufficient for the problem's constraints.\n\nSo first step:\n\nRead the string and k.\n\nThen, process the first program's logic:\n\nLoop through the first k characters of the string. For each i from 0 to k-1:\n\n   if the character is '1', continue unless it's the last (i ==k-1), then output '1'.\n\n   else, output the current character and break.\n\nSo in C:\n\nchar first_output;\n\nint i;\n\nfor (i=0; i<k; i++) {\n\n    if (str[i] == '1') {\n\n        if (i == k-1) {\n\n            first_output = '1';\n\n        }\n\n        continue;\n\n    } else {\n\n        first_output = str[i];\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but after the loop, if we didn't break, then we have to set first_output to '1'.\n\nWait, the loop runs for i from 0 to k-1. So after the loop, if we didn't break, then all characters up to k-1 were '1's. So first_output should be '1'.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nchar first_output = '1';\n\nfor (i=0; i<k; i++) {\n\n    if (str[i] != '1') {\n\n        first_output = str[i];\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, that's a better way. Because if any character before k is not '1', then first_output is that character and break. Otherwise, after the loop, it remains '1'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo that's the first step.\n\nSecond step: process the second program's logic on first_output.\n\nThe second program's input is the first_output character as a string. So the input to the second program is a string of length 1 (the first_output).\n\nThe second program's code:\n\ns = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\nThen, count the number of A followed by D pairs.\n\nBut since the input is a single character, the replacement does nothing. So s is the same as the input character.\n\nThen, the code loops through each character in s (which is one character):\n\nInitialize cnt=0, tmp=0.\n\nFor each character in s:\n\n   if it's 'A', tmp +=1.\n\n   else if it's 'D', cnt += tmp.\n\n   else, tmp =0.\n\nSo for a single character:\n\nIf the character is 'A':\n\n   tmp becomes 1. Since it's not D, nothing added to cnt. So cnt remains 0.\n\nIf the character is 'D':\n\n   since tmp is 0 (no A before), cnt +=0 \u2192 0.\n\nIf it's any other character (like 'B', '1', etc.):\n\n   tmp is set to 0. So cnt remains 0.\n\nThus, the second program's output is 0 in all cases except when the input is \"AD\" (but that's two characters).\n\nThus, the second program's output is 0.\n\nWait, but in code, the second program's output is the count, which is 0.\n\nSo the second program's output is 0.\n\nThus, the third program's input is the string \"0\".\n\nThird step: process the third program's logic on the string \"0\".\n\nThe third program reads the input string (the second program's output as a string), counts the frequency of each character, then counts how many have odd counts.\n\nThe input is \"0\", so the characters are '0' \u2192 count is 1 (odd). So oddCount is 1.\n\nThus, the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nSo the final output is \"First\".\n\nBut according to the code, the third program's output is \"First\" in all cases.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's code.\n\nWait, let me re-express the second program's code in C.\n\nThe second program's input is the first_output character (a single character).\n\nThe second program's processing:\n\ns is the input string (the first_output character).\n\nThen, replace all \"BC\" with \"D\". Since the input is a single character, there are no BC pairs, so s remains the same.\n\nThen, loop through each character in s:\n\nInitialize cnt=0, tmp=0.\n\nFor each character in s:\n\n   if (c == 'A') \u2192 tmp +=1.\n\n   else if (c == 'D') \u2192 cnt += tmp.\n\n   else \u2192 tmp =0.\n\nSo for a single character:\n\nIf the character is 'A':\n\n   tmp becomes 1. Since it's not D, nothing added to cnt. So cnt is 0.\n\nIf the character is 'D':\n\n   since tmp is 0 (no A before), cnt +=0 \u2192 0.\n\nIf it's 'B' \u2192 else clause \u2192 tmp=0 \u2192 cnt remains 0.\n\nThus, the second program's output is 0.\n\nThus, the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nThus, the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nSo the entire sequence's output is always \"First\".\n\nHmm, but perhaps the first program's output can be a 'A' followed by 'D' in some way?\n\nWait, no. The first program's output is a single character.\n\nThus, the final output is always \"First\".\n\nBut perhaps the problem's actual input is such that the first program's output is a string that allows the second program to have a non-zero count. But according to the first program's code, that's impossible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code's logic.\n\nWait, let me think of an example where the first program's output is 'A', then the second program's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nAnother example: first program's output is 'AD' \u2192 but that's impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWell, given that, I'll proceed to write the C code accordingly.\n\nNow, the C program must read the initial input (string and k), compute the first_output character, then compute the second program's output (0), then compute the third program's output based on the string \"0\".\n\nWait, but the second program's output is 0, so the third program's input is the string \"0\".\n\nThus, the third program's processing is fixed to \"0\".\n\nThus, the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nSo the entire C program can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input string and k.\n\nCompute first_output as per first program's logic.\n\nThen, compute second_output as 0.\n\nThen, compute third_output based on the string \"0\".\n\nBut since the second_output is always 0, the third program's input is always \"0\".\n\nThus, the third program's output is always \"First\".\n\nSo the C program can be written to directly output \"First\".\n\nWait, but that's only if the second program's output is always 0. But according to the first program's logic, that's the case.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a case where the first program's output is 'A', then the second program's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the entire sequence's output is always \"First\".\n\nSo the C program can be written to read the input, process the first program's logic (which is irrelevant because the second program's output is always 0), and then output \"First\".\n\nBut that's not correct because the first program's output could be different, but the second program's output is always 0.\n\nWait, but according to the analysis, the second program's output is always 0 regardless of the first program's output. Thus, the third program's input is always \"0\", leading to \"First\".\n\nThus, the C program can be written to ignore the first and second steps and directly output \"First\".\n\nBut that's only true if the second program's output is always 0. But perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, let me think of a case where the first program's output is 'A', then the second program's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 'D' \u2192 second's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 same.\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 'B' \u2192 second's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 same.\n\nThus, the final output is always \"First\".\n\nThus, the C program can be written as:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char str[100000]; // assuming input string length is manageable\n    long long k;\n    scanf(\"%s %lld\", str, &k);\n    // process first program's logic (but it's irrelevant)\n    // compute first_output, but it doesn't affect the result\n    // since second program's output is always 0, third's input is \"0\"\n    // thus, the third program's output is \"First\"\n    printf(\"First\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut that's a possible solution. But perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is a 'A', then the second program's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the first program's output is a 'A' followed by 'D'? No, the first program's output is a single character.\n\nThus, the C program can indeed output \"First\" regardless of the input.\n\nBut that seems too simple. Perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's code.\n\nWait, let me re-express the second program's code in C.\n\nThe second program's input is the first_output character (a single character).\n\nThe second program's code:\n\ns = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\nBut in C, we can represent this as:\n\nchar s[2]; // since it's a single character plus null.\n\ns[0] = first_output;\n\ns[1] = '\\0';\n\nThen, replace all \"BC\" with \"D\". But since the length is 1, there's no BC.\n\nThen, loop through each character in s:\n\nInitialize cnt=0, tmp=0.\n\nfor (i=0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n\n    char c = s[i];\n\n    if (c == 'A') {\n\n        tmp++;\n\n    } else if (c == 'D') {\n\n        cnt += tmp;\n\n    } else {\n\n        tmp =0;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, the cnt is 0.\n\nThus, the second program's output is 0.\n\nThus, the third program's input is \"0\".\n\nThus, the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nThus, the C program can indeed output \"First\" regardless of the input.\n\nBut that's surprising. Perhaps the problem's actual input is such that the first program's output is a string that allows the second program to have a non-zero count. But according to the first program's code, that's impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code's logic.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nThe first program's loop runs for k iterations. For each i from 0 to k-1:\n\n   if c[i] is '1', then check if it's the last iteration (i ==k-1). If so, print '1' and return.\n\n   else, continue.\n\nElse, print c[i] and return.\n\nThus, the first program's output is the first non-'1' character in the first k characters, or '1' if all are '1's.\n\nThus, the first program's output is a single character.\n\nThus, the second program's output is 0.\n\nThus, the third program's output is \"First\".\n\nThus, the C program can be written as follows:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char str[100000];\n    long long k;\n    scanf(\"%s %lld\", str, &k);\n    // The first program's output is irrelevant because second program's output is always 0.\n    // Thus, third program's input is \"0\", leading to output \"First\".\n    printf(\"First\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut that's the case.\n\nBut perhaps the first program's output can be a 'A', then the second program's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\" \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the final C program can be written as above.\n\nBut I'm not sure if there's a case where the second program's output is non-zero.\n\nWait, let's imagine that the first program's output is a string like \"A\", then the second program's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\".\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 'D' \u2192 second's output is 0 \u2192 third's input is \"0\".\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 'BC' \u2192 but that's impossible because first program's output is a single character.\n\nThus, the C program can indeed output \"First\" regardless of the input.\n\nThus, the final C program is as above.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the third program's logic.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nThe third program reads a string (the second program's output as a string).\n\nCounts the frequency of each character.\n\nCounts how many have odd counts.\n\nIf the count of such characters is 0 or 1, or odd (but the condition is (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0)), then output \"First\".\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 \"First\".\n\nSo for oddCount =1 \u2192 yes.\n\nFor oddCount =3 \u2192 yes.\n\nFor oddCount =2 \u2192 no.\n\nFor oddCount =0 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus, the third program's output is \"First\" if the number of characters with odd counts is 0,1,3,5, etc.\n\nIn the case of the input being \"0\", the count of '0' is 1 \u2192 oddCount is 1 \u2192 \"First\".\n\nThus, the final"
