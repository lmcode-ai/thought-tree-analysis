Since the possible last3 strings are 4^3 = 64, for each current length (from 0 to N), we can have an array of 64 elements, each corresponding to a possible last3 string. So in C, for memoization, perhaps we can precompute all possible last3 strings, assign each a unique index (like 0 to 63), then use a 2D array memo[N+1][64], where each entry holds the computed value. First, we need to map the last3 string to an index. Let's see: each character can be A, C, G, T. Let's assign each a value (like A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3). Then the last3 can be represented as a 3-digit number in base4, so the index is (a * 16) + (b *4) + c, where a, b, c are the values of the first, second, third characters. Wait, for example, \"AAA\" would be 0,0,0 \u2192 0*16 +0*4 +0 =0. \"AAG\" would be 0,0,2 \u2192 0*16 +0*4 +2=2, etc. So each possible 3-character string can be mapped to a number between 0 and 63. So first, create a helper function to convert a 3-character string to its index. Let's see:\n\nEach character can be converted to 0-3. So for a string s of length 3:\n\nindex = (s[0] code) * 16 + (s[1] code)*4 + (s[2] code).",

Wait, let's see: For example, if idx is 0, then:\n\nidx /16 = 0 \u2192 first character is 'A'\n\n(0 mod16)/4 = 0 \u2192 second character 'A'\n\n0 mod4 \u2192 0 \u2192 third 'A' \u2192 \"AAA\". Yes. So, given an index, we can get the last3 string.",

So better to make a helper function that returns a new array each time, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, pass a buffer. Alternatively, inside the dfs function, when we need the last3 string, we can compute it directly from the index:\n\nvoid get_last3_str(int idx, char *dest) {\n    dest[0] = num_to_char( (idx /16) );\n    dest[1] = num_to_char( (idx %16)/4 );\n    dest[2] = num_to_char( idx %4 );\n    dest[3] = '\\0';\n} So, in the dfs function:\n\nchar last3[4];\nget_last3_str(last3_idx, last3);\n\nThen proceed. This way, the function can build the four-character string. Now, the functions:\n\nFirst, the helper functions:\n\nchar num_to_char(int n) {\n    switch(n) {\n        case 0: return 'A';\n        case 1: return 'C';\n        case 2: return 'G';\n        case 3: return 'T';\n        default: return '?';\n    }\n}\n\nint char_to_num(char c) {\n    switch(c) {\n        case 'A': return 0;\n        case 'C': return 1;\n        case 'G': return 2;\n        case 'T': return 3;\n        default: return -1;\n    }\n}\n\nint str_to_index(char *s) {\n    int a = char_to_num(s[0]);\n    int b = char_to_num(s[1]);\n    int c = char_to_num(s[2]);\n    return a*16 + b*4 + c;\n}\n\nvoid get_last3_str(int idx, char *dest) {\n    dest[0] = num_to_char( (idx /16) );\n    dest[1] = num_to_char( (idx %16)/4 );\n    dest[2] = num_to_char( idx %4 );\n    dest[3] = '\\0';\n}\n\nNow, the isOK function:\n\nint isOK(char *s) {\n    // s is a 4-character string (plus null)\n    if (strstr(s, \"AGC\") ! = NULL) return 0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        char temp[5];\n        strcpy(temp, s);\n        char t = temp[i];\n        temp[i] = temp[i+1];\n        temp[i+1] = t;\n        if (strstr(temp, \"AGC\") ! = NULL) return 0;\n    }\n    return 1;\n} Now, the memo array needs to be initialized to -1. The main steps for the first part:\n\nRead N from stdin. Initialize memo array. Compute the result by calling dfs(0, index of \"TTT\"). The initial last3 is \"TTT\", so its index is:\n\nchar initial_last3[4] = \"TTT\";\nint initial_idx = str_to_index(initial_last3);\n\nThen, the result is dfs(0, initial_idx).",

The second Java program's code:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n    String word = in.next();\n    int uppercase = 0;\n    int lowercase = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {\n        char ch = word.charAt(i); if (Character.isUpperCase(ch)) {\n            uppercase++;\n        } else {\n            lowercase++;\n        }\n    } if (uppercase > lowercase) System.out.println(word.toUpperCase());\n    else if (lowercase > uppercase) System.out.println(word.toLowerCase());\n    else System.out.println(word.toLowerCase());\n}\n\nSo, in C, the second step is:\n\nTake the string (from first's result), count uppercase and lowercase letters. Then, convert the entire string to uppercase or lowercase based on counts. The third step is to replace commas with spaces in the resulting string. The third Java program's code:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    String a = br.readLine();\n    sb.append(a.replace(\",\", \" \"));\n    System.out.println(sb);\n} So, in C, the third step is to read the string from the second step, replace all commas with spaces, then output. Putting it all together:\n\nThe C program will:\n\n1. Read N from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first part's result (the number) using the DP approach. 3. Convert the number to a string (e.g., using sprintf).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file is atcoder_ABC122_D. It reads an integer N from input, then uses a recursive DP approach with memoization to calculate some value modulo 1e9+7. The problem seems to be about counting valid strings of length N avoiding certain substrings like \"AGC\". The main function calls calc(), which returns the result, and prints it.\n\nThe second file is codeforces_59_A. It reads a word, counts uppercase and lowercase letters, then converts the word to all uppercase or lowercase based on which count is higher, or lowercase if equal. So it processes the input string from the first program's output?\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, so maybe the second program isn't processing that? Wait, no, the user said the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output to the third. But the first program outputs a number, the second expects a word. Hmm, maybe I need to check the actual flow.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a number (the result of ins.calc()), which is printed. The second program expects a word as input (Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); word = in.next();). So the first program's output is a number, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program is expecting a string (word). Wait, that might not make sense. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe the actual sequence is different. Wait, the user says the programs are executed in sequence, with each output as next's input. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output to the third. But the first program's output is a number, so the second program would read that number as a string? Like, if the first outputs \"123\", the second would process \"123\" as the word. Then the second program would output either \"123\" in lowercase or uppercase, then the third program would process that string, replacing commas with spaces? Wait, the third program's code is reading a line and replacing commas with spaces. So the third program's input is a string, which comes from the second's output. \n\nSo the overall flow is: input to first program (N) \u2192 first outputs a number \u2192 second takes that number as a string, processes it (converts to all lowercase or uppercase) \u2192 third takes that string and replaces commas with spaces (but the second's output is a number, so no commas, so the third just outputs the same string). Wait, but the third program's code is replacing commas with spaces. So if the second's output is a number like \"123\", then the third would just output \"123\" as well. So the final output is the same as the second's output, which is the first's output converted to lowercase or uppercase.\n\nWait, but the second program's logic is: if uppercase count > lowercase, uppercase the whole word; else lowercase. So for a number like \"123\", which has no letters, uppercase count is 0, lowercase is 0. Then it would output lowercase, so \"123\" remains. So the third program would read \"123\" and output \"123\" (since no commas). So the final output is the same as the first's output, but in lowercase? Wait, but the first's output is a number, so it's digits, which are lowercase letters? Or maybe the first's output is a number like 123, which is printed as \"123\", so the second program treats it as a string of lowercase letters (digits are lowercase?), so the second program would output the same string. Then the third program just outputs it again. So the final output is the same as the first's output. But that seems odd. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps the actual sequence is different. Alternatively, maybe the second program is supposed to process the first's output as a string, but the third program is expecting a different input. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed as per the given code, even if the flow seems a bit odd.\n\nNow, the task is to translate all three into a single C program. The key points are:\n\n- Only the first block (first Java program) should read input. So in C, the first part (equivalent to first Java) reads N from stdin.\n\n- The last block (third Java) should produce output. So the third part's code in C will write the final output.\n\n- Intermediate steps (second and third Java) must process data without I/O. So the first part's output is passed to the second's processing, then to the third's processing, all in memory.\n\nSo the C program must:\n\n1. Read N from stdin (first Java's job).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the number from the first Java's calc()).\n\n3. Take that number as a string, process it as per the second Java (convert to uppercase or lowercase).\n\n4. Take the resulting string, process it as per the third Java (replace commas with spaces).\n\n5. Output the final string.\n\nWait, but the first Java's output is a number, so when converted to a string, it's the digits. The second Java processes that string (the number as a string) to decide uppercase or lowercase. Since digits are neither uppercase nor lowercase letters, their counts would be zero. So uppercase count is 0, lowercase is 0. So the second program would output the lowercase version, which is the same as the input (digits are already lowercase). Then the third program replaces commas with spaces, but there are none, so the output is the same as the input. So the final output is the same as the first's output. But that's a bit strange. Maybe the problem's actual sequence is different, but I have to follow the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program is supposed to process the first's output as a string, but the first's output is a number, so the second's input is that number's string representation. So the second program's processing is to make it all lowercase (since uppercase count is zero, so lowercase). The third program then takes that string and replaces commas with spaces. Since the first's output is a number, there are no commas, so the third just outputs the same string. So the final output is the same as the first's output. But that's redundant. However, the user's instruction is to translate the sequence as given, so I have to proceed.\n\nNow, the main challenge is to implement all three steps in C, with the first part reading input, then processing in memory, and the last part outputting.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the first Java program's logic. It's a DP problem with memoization. The code uses memoization to count the number of valid strings of length N avoiding certain patterns. The key is to translate this into C with memoization.\n\nThe first Java program's main steps:\n\n- Read N from input.\n\n- Use a recursive DFS with memoization to compute the count.\n\nThe memo is an array of maps, where each map is for a current length and the last 3 characters. Since in C, we can't have maps, we need to represent this with a 2D array or some other structure. Alternatively, since the possible last3 strings are limited (each character is A, C, G, T, so 4^3 = 64 possibilities), we can represent the last3 as a string (or a 3-character code) and use a 2D array for memoization.\n\nLet me think: the memo is an array of size N+1, each element is a map from strings (last3) to long values. Since the possible last3 strings are 4^3 = 64, for each current length (from 0 to N), we can have an array of 64 elements, each corresponding to a possible last3 string.\n\nSo in C, for memoization, perhaps we can precompute all possible last3 strings, assign each a unique index (like 0 to 63), then use a 2D array memo[N+1][64], where each entry holds the computed value.\n\nFirst, we need to map the last3 string to an index. Let's see: each character can be A, C, G, T. Let's assign each a value (like A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3). Then the last3 can be represented as a 3-digit number in base4, so the index is (a * 16) + (b *4) + c, where a, b, c are the values of the first, second, third characters.\n\nWait, for example, \"AAA\" would be 0,0,0 \u2192 0*16 +0*4 +0 =0. \"AAG\" would be 0,0,2 \u2192 0*16 +0*4 +2=2, etc. So each possible 3-character string can be mapped to a number between 0 and 63.\n\nSo first, create a helper function to convert a 3-character string to its index. Let's see:\n\nEach character can be converted to 0-3. So for a string s of length 3:\n\nindex = (s[0] code) * 16 + (s[1] code)*4 + (s[2] code).\n\nWait, 4^2 is 16, so first character contributes 16, second 4, third 1.\n\nYes. So for each character, we can map 'A' to 0, 'C' to 1, 'G' to 2, 'T' to 3. So the function would be:\n\nint str_to_index(char *s) {\n    int a = char_to_num(s[0]);\n    int b = char_to_num(s[1]);\n    int c = char_to_num(s[2]);\n    return a*16 + b*4 + c;\n}\n\nwhere char_to_num is a helper function:\n\nint char_to_num(char c) {\n    switch(c) {\n        case 'A': return 0;\n        case 'C': return 1;\n        case 'G': return 2;\n        case 'T': return 3;\n        default: return -1; // error\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, the last3 is a string of 3 characters. So when building the index, we need to process each character.\n\nNow, the memo array can be a 2D array of size (N+1) x 64. Since N can be up to... Well, the original problem's constraints for ABC122 D probably have N up to 1e5 or something, but in the Java code, the memo is initialized as new Map[N+1], so in C, if N is large, this could be a problem. Wait, but in the problem's context, maybe N is up to 1e5? But in C, a 2D array of (1e5+1)*64 elements would be 64*(1e5+1) = ~6.4e6 elements, which is manageable as long as N isn't too big. But perhaps the problem's constraints for that problem have N up to 50 or so? Let me check the problem statement for ABC122 D. Wait, I don't have the problem statement, but the code uses memoization with N up to whatever. Let's assume that N can be up to 1e5, but in C, using a 2D array may be memory intensive. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's constraints are small. Alternatively, maybe the code can be optimized with iterative DP instead of recursive, but the user wants to translate the code as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's N is up to 2000, but I need to proceed.\n\nSo, in C, the first part will need to compute the result of the first Java program. Let's outline the steps:\n\nFirst, read N from stdin.\n\nInitialize the memo array. Since in C, we can't have dynamic arrays, but since N is read first, we can allocate a 2D array using malloc. But for simplicity, perhaps we can use a static array if N is small. Alternatively, since the code is to be a single C program, perhaps the user expects that N is manageable. Let's proceed with dynamic allocation.\n\nWait, but in C, for a function to have a variable-sized array, it's better to use malloc. So:\n\nlong long memo[N+1][64]; // but N is variable. So need to use malloc.\n\nWait, but in C, variable-length arrays (VLAs) are allowed in C99, but not all compilers support it. Alternatively, use malloc.\n\nSo, after reading N, we can allocate a 2D array:\n\nint N;\nscanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\n// Allocate memo as (N+1) rows, each with 64 elements.\nlong long **memo = malloc( (N+1)*sizeof(long long*) );\nfor (int i=0; i<=N; i++) {\n    memo[i] = calloc(64, sizeof(long long));\n}\n\nWait, but we need to track whether a value has been computed. Since in Java, the map only stores entries when they are computed. So in C, perhaps we can use a separate array to track whether the value is computed, or use a special value (like -1) to indicate uncomputed. Since the result is modulo 1e9+7, which is positive, we can set uncomputed entries to -1 (but since it's long long, maybe use a flag).\n\nAlternatively, since the memo is initialized to 0, but the initial value is 0, which could be a valid value. Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, use a separate 2D array of booleans (or a bitmask) to track computed entries. But that might be memory-heavy. Alternatively, use a value like -1 as a flag for uncomputed. Since the actual result is modulo 1e9+7, which is up to 1e9, so -1 can be used as a flag.\n\nSo, initializing the memo array with -1 for all entries. Then, when a value is computed, store it modulo 1e9+7, and set the flag.\n\nWait, but in C, the initial value of allocated memory via calloc is 0. So perhaps we can use a different approach. Let me think:\n\nInitialize all entries to -1 (uncomputed). So when we allocate, we can set each entry to -1.\n\nWait, but using malloc and then setting each element to -1 would be time-consuming for large N. Alternatively, perhaps use a helper function.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, when checking if a value is computed, we can check if memo[current][index] != -1.\n\nSo, the steps for the first part (the first Java program's logic):\n\nImplement the recursive DFS with memoization. But in C, recursion might hit stack limits for large N. The original Java code uses recursion, but in C, for large N (like 1e5), this would cause stack overflow. So perhaps we need to convert it to an iterative DP approach.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. The original code uses a recursive approach with memoization. If N is large, say 2000, then the recursion depth could be 2000, which is manageable. But if N is up to 1e5, then recursion is impossible. So perhaps the problem's constraints for ABC122 D have N up to 50 or so? Let me think. The problem ABC122 D is from AtCoder, and looking up the problem (if I can recall), the constraints for that problem are N up to 50 or 1e5? Wait, I think the problem's constraints for ABC122 D are N up to 50, but I'm not sure. Let's assume that the code can handle it with recursion. Alternatively, perhaps the code can be converted to iterative DP.\n\nAlternatively, proceed with recursion but in C, but with the risk of stack overflow. Since the user wants a direct translation, perhaps proceed with recursion, but in C, the stack might be a problem. Alternatively, use memoization with iterative approach.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the steps again.\n\nThe first Java program's main function is:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    atcoder_ABC122_D ins = new atcoder_ABC122_D();\n    System.out.println(ins.calc());\n}\n\nThe calc() function calls dfs(0, \"TTT\").\n\nThe dfs function is recursive, with memoization. The base case is when current == N, return 1.\n\nThe isOK function checks if the last4 (last3 + new character) is invalid, or any permutation of two adjacent characters in last4 forms \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the isOK function in Java:\n\nboolean isOK(String last4) {\n    if (last4.contains(\"AGC\")) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n        char[] vals = last4.toCharArray();\n        vals[i] = last4.charAt(i + 1);\n        vals[i + 1] = last4.charAt(i);\n        String s = new String(vals);\n        if (s.contains(\"AGC\")) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\nWait, the code is checking if the last4 contains \"AGC\", and also, for each pair of adjacent characters, swapping them and checking if the resulting string contains \"AGC\". Because the problem requires that the string does not contain \"AGC\" as a substring, and also that it cannot be formed by a single swap of two adjacent characters. Wait, the problem's constraints might be that the string must not contain \"AGC\", and also that it cannot be transformed into a string containing \"AGC\" by swapping any two adjacent characters. So the isOK function is checking both conditions.\n\nSo, in the code, the last4 is the last four characters (since adding a new character to last3 gives a four-character string). Wait, no, the last3 is the last three characters, and when adding a new character, the new last4 is last3 + c. Wait, the code in dfs:\n\nif (isOK(last3 + c)) { ... }\n\nWait, the last3 is the previous three characters, so adding the new character c makes a four-character string (last3 + c). The isOK function checks that this four-character string does not contain \"AGC\", and also that any swap of two adjacent characters in the four-character string would not create \"AGC\".\n\nWait, the code in isOK is:\n\nCheck if the four-character string contains \"AGC\". If yes, return false.\n\nThen, for each of the first three positions (i from 0 to 2), swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters, then check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\". If any of those swaps result in \"AGC\", return false.\n\nSo the four-character string must not contain \"AGC\", and also, any adjacent swap must not create \"AGC\".\n\nTherefore, the isOK function is ensuring that the four-character string is \"safe\".\n\nNow, translating this into C.\n\nFirst, the isOK function in C:\n\nWe need to check the four-character string (last3 + c) for the conditions.\n\nWait, in the code, the last3 is a string of three characters, and adding a new character c makes a four-character string. So the four-character string is last3 concatenated with c.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nif (isOK(last3 + c)) { ... }\n\nSo the argument to isOK is the four-character string (last3 + c).\n\nSo in C, the isOK function takes a four-character string (or a 4-length char array) and returns a boolean (0 or 1).\n\nImplementing that:\n\nint isOK(char *s) {\n    // s is a 4-character string.\n\n    // Check if contains \"AGC\"\n    if (strstr(s, \"AGC\") != NULL) return 0;\n\n    // Check each possible swap of adjacent characters\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        char temp[5];\n        strcpy(temp, s);\n        // swap characters at positions i and i+1\n        char c = temp[i];\n        temp[i] = temp[i+1];\n        temp[i+1] = c;\n        if (strstr(temp, \"AGC\") != NULL) return 0;\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, strings are null-terminated, so the four-character string must be stored as a 5-character array (including '\\0'). So when passing s, it should be a 4-character string plus null.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps pass a 4-character array and handle it as such.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, when building the four-character string, we can create a temporary array of 5 characters (including null).\n\nNow, the main part is the recursive DFS with memoization.\n\nIn C, the memo array is a 2D array of (N+1) rows and 64 columns (for the last3 index). Each entry holds the computed value modulo 1e9+7, or -1 if not computed.\n\nThe recursive function would be something like:\n\nlong long dfs(int current, char *last3) {\n\n    // convert last3 to index\n    int idx = str_to_index(last3);\n\n    if (memo[current][idx] != -1) return memo[current][idx];\n\n    if (current == N) return 1;\n\n    long long res = 0;\n    for each of the four characters (A, C, G, T) {\n        char new_char = ...;\n        char new_last4[5] = {last3[0], last3[1], last3[2], new_char, '\\0'};\n        if (isOK(new_last4)) {\n            // the new last3 is last3[1..2] + new_char\n            char new_last3[4];\n            new_last3[0] = last3[1];\n            new_last3[1] = last3[2];\n            new_last3[2] = new_char;\n            new_last3[3] = '\\0';\n            res += dfs(current +1, new_last3);\n            res %= MOD;\n        }\n    }\n    memo[current][idx] = res % MOD;\n    return res % MOD;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, recursion depth could be up to N, which for N=20 is okay, but for N=2000, it might hit stack limits. So perhaps better to implement this iteratively.\n\nAlternatively, proceed with recursion but in C, but the user might have to assume that N is small enough.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed with the recursive approach, but in C, using the memo array.\n\nBut first, the initial call is dfs(0, \"TTT\").\n\nSo the initial last3 is \"TTT\".\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in C with memoization.\n\nBut in C, functions can't return long long and have parameters with strings easily. So perhaps the memo array is a global variable, and the function is written with parameters as current and the last3's index.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the last3 as an index (the 0-63 value) instead of a string. That would make the function parameters simpler.\n\nSo, the function can take current and the index of last3, and return the value.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Precompute all possible last3 strings and their indices.\n\n- The function dfs(int current, int last3_idx) returns the count.\n\nThis way, the parameters are integers, which is easier.\n\nSo, the isOK function would need to take the last3 (as a string) plus the new character, form the four-character string, then check.\n\nWait, but to compute isOK, we need the four-character string. So perhaps, when adding a new character, we can generate the four-character string from the last3 (as a string) plus the new character.\n\nAlternatively, since the last3 is represented by its index, we can reconstruct the string from the index.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit involved. Let's think:\n\nThe index is computed from the three characters. To get the string from the index, we can do:\n\nchar *index_to_str(int idx) {\n    static char s[4];\n    s[3] = '\\0';\n    s[0] = num_to_char( (idx / 16) );\n    s[1] = num_to_char( (idx % 16)/4 );\n    s[2] = num_to_char( idx %4 );\n    return s;\n}\n\nwhere num_to_char is a function that converts 0-3 to 'A','C','G','T'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, if idx is 0, then:\n\nidx /16 = 0 \u2192 first character is 'A'\n\n(0 mod16)/4 = 0 \u2192 second character 'A'\n\n0 mod4 \u2192 0 \u2192 third 'A' \u2192 \"AAA\".\n\nYes.\n\nSo, given an index, we can get the last3 string.\n\nThus, in the dfs function, when we have the last3 index, we can get the string, then append the new character to form the four-character string for isOK.\n\nSo, the steps for the dfs function:\n\nlong long dfs(int current, int last3_idx) {\n\n    if (memo[current][last3_idx] != -1) return memo[current][last3_idx];\n\n    if (current == N) return 1;\n\n    long long res = 0;\n\n    char last3[4];\n    strcpy(last3, index_to_str(last3_idx));\n\n    for each possible next character (A, C, G, T) {\n\n        char c = ...;\n\n        // form the four-character string: last3[0], last3[1], last3[2], c\n\n        char four[5] = {last3[0], last3[1], last3[2], c, '\\0'};\n\n        if (isOK(four)) {\n\n            // new last3 is last3[1], last3[2], c \u2192 which is the substring from 1 to 3 (since last3 is 3 chars)\n\n            // compute the new last3's index.\n\n            char new_last3[4];\n            new_last3[0] = last3[1];\n            new_last3[1] = last3[2];\n            new_last3[2] = c;\n            new_last3[3] = '\\0';\n\n            int new_idx = str_to_index(new_last3);\n\n            res += dfs(current+1, new_idx);\n            res %= MOD;\n        }\n    }\n\n    memo[current][last3_idx] = res % MOD;\n    return res % MOD;\n}\n\nWait, but the function index_to_str returns a static array, so when we call it multiple times, it might overwrite. So better to make a helper function that returns a new array each time, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, pass a buffer.\n\nAlternatively, inside the dfs function, when we need the last3 string, we can compute it directly from the index:\n\nvoid get_last3_str(int idx, char *dest) {\n    dest[0] = num_to_char( (idx /16) );\n    dest[1] = num_to_char( (idx %16)/4 );\n    dest[2] = num_to_char( idx %4 );\n    dest[3] = '\\0';\n}\n\nSo, in the dfs function:\n\nchar last3[4];\nget_last3_str(last3_idx, last3);\n\nThen proceed.\n\nThis way, the function can build the four-character string.\n\nNow, the functions:\n\nFirst, the helper functions:\n\nchar num_to_char(int n) {\n    switch(n) {\n        case 0: return 'A';\n        case 1: return 'C';\n        case 2: return 'G';\n        case 3: return 'T';\n        default: return '?';\n    }\n}\n\nint char_to_num(char c) {\n    switch(c) {\n        case 'A': return 0;\n        case 'C': return 1;\n        case 'G': return 2;\n        case 'T': return 3;\n        default: return -1;\n    }\n}\n\nint str_to_index(char *s) {\n    int a = char_to_num(s[0]);\n    int b = char_to_num(s[1]);\n    int c = char_to_num(s[2]);\n    return a*16 + b*4 + c;\n}\n\nvoid get_last3_str(int idx, char *dest) {\n    dest[0] = num_to_char( (idx /16) );\n    dest[1] = num_to_char( (idx %16)/4 );\n    dest[2] = num_to_char( idx %4 );\n    dest[3] = '\\0';\n}\n\nNow, the isOK function:\n\nint isOK(char *s) {\n    // s is a 4-character string (plus null)\n    if (strstr(s, \"AGC\") != NULL) return 0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        char temp[5];\n        strcpy(temp, s);\n        char t = temp[i];\n        temp[i] = temp[i+1];\n        temp[i+1] = t;\n        if (strstr(temp, \"AGC\") != NULL) return 0;\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nNow, the memo array needs to be initialized to -1.\n\nThe main steps for the first part:\n\nRead N from stdin.\n\nInitialize memo array.\n\nCompute the result by calling dfs(0, index of \"TTT\").\n\nThe initial last3 is \"TTT\", so its index is:\n\nchar initial_last3[4] = \"TTT\";\nint initial_idx = str_to_index(initial_last3);\n\nThen, the result is dfs(0, initial_idx).\n\nNow, the problem is implementing this in C with recursion.\n\nBut in C, the memo array must be accessible to the dfs function. So perhaps make it a global variable.\n\nAlternatively, pass it as a parameter, but that complicates the function signature.\n\nSo, let's make it global.\n\nSo, in the C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define MOD 1000000007LL\n\nlong long memo[1001][64]; // assuming N up to 1000. But need to dynamically allocate?\n\nWait, but N can be up to, say, 2000. So perhaps use a dynamic array.\n\nWait, but in the code, the first part must read N first, then allocate the memo array.\n\nHmm, so the code structure would be:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\n    // Allocate memo array\n    long long **memo = malloc( (N+1)*sizeof(long long*) );\n    for (int i=0; i<=N; i++) {\n        memo[i] = calloc(64, sizeof(long long));\n    }\n\n    // Initialize all entries to -1\n    for (int i=0; i<=N; i++) {\n        for (int j=0; j<64; j++) {\n            memo[i][j] = -1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Compute initial index\n    char initial_last3[4] = \"TTT\";\n    int initial_idx = str_to_index(initial_last3);\n\n    long long result = dfs(0, initial_idx, N, memo);\n\n    // Free the memo arrays\n    for (int i=0; i<=N; i++) {\n        free(memo[i]);\n    }\n    free(memo);\n\n    // Now, pass this result to the second part.\n\n    // ... and so on.\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but the dfs function needs to have access to N and the memo array. So the dfs function must take those as parameters.\n\nAlternatively, make N and memo global variables. Let's try that.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nlong long memo[1001][64]; // assuming N up to 1000. But this is a fixed size. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, use dynamic allocation and pass pointers.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of a way to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, since the first part is the first block, and the rest are in memory, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\nIn the C program:\n\nRead N.\n\nCompute the first part's result (the number).\n\nThen, process that number as a string through the second and third programs.\n\nSo, the first part's result is stored as a string (the number as a string), then passed to the second processing step, then to the third.\n\nThus, the first part's code must compute the number, then convert it to a string.\n\nSo, the first part's code in C:\n\nAfter computing the result (the number), we can convert it to a string using sprintf.\n\nThen, the second part's processing is to take that string and decide to uppercase or lowercase.\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n    String word = in.next();\n    int uppercase = 0;\n    int lowercase = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {\n        char ch = word.charAt(i);\n        if (Character.isUpperCase(ch)) {\n            uppercase++;\n        } else {\n            lowercase++;\n        }\n    }\n    if (uppercase > lowercase) System.out.println(word.toUpperCase());\n    else if (lowercase > uppercase) System.out.println(word.toLowerCase());\n    else System.out.println(word.toLowerCase());\n}\n\nSo, in C, the second step is:\n\nTake the string (from first's result), count uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\nThen, convert the entire string to uppercase or lowercase based on counts.\n\nThe third step is to replace commas with spaces in the resulting string.\n\nThe third Java program's code:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    String a = br.readLine();\n    sb.append(a.replace(\",\", \" \"));\n    System.out.println(sb);\n}\n\nSo, in C, the third step is to read the string from the second step, replace all commas with spaces, then output.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe C program will:\n\n1. Read N from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first part's result (the number) using the DP approach.\n\n3. Convert the number to a string (e.g., using sprintf).\n\n4. Process the string through the second step's logic (count uppercase/lowercase, convert to all uppercase or lowercase).\n\n5. Process the resulting string through the third step's logic (replace commas with spaces).\n\n6. Output the final string.\n\nNow, the main challenge is implementing the first part's DP correctly in C, handling the memoization and recursion.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define MOD 1000000007LL\n\n// Helper functions\nchar num_to_char(int n) {\n    switch(n) {\n        case 0: return 'A';\n        case 1: return 'C';\n        case 2: return 'G';\n        case 3: return 'T';\n        default: return '?';\n    }\n}\n\nint char_to_num(char c) {\n    switch(c) {\n        case 'A': return 0;\n        case 'C': return 1;\n        case 'G': return 2;\n        case 'T': return 3;\n        default: return -1;\n    }\n}\n\nint str_to_index(char *s) {\n    int a = char_to_num(s[0]);\n    int b = char_to_num(s[1]);\n    int c = char_to_num(s[2]);\n    return a*16 + b*4 + c;\n}\n\nvoid get_last3_str(int idx, char *dest) {\n    dest[0] = num_to_char( (idx /16) );\n    dest[1] = num_to_char( (idx %16)/4 );\n    dest[2] = num_to_char( idx %4 );\n    dest[3] = '\\0';\n}\n\nint isOK(char *s) {\n    if (strstr(s, \"AGC\") != NULL) return 0;\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        char temp[5];\n        strcpy(temp, s);\n        char t = temp[i];\n        temp[i] = temp[i+1];\n        temp[i+1] = t;\n        if (strstr(temp, \"AGC\") != NULL) return 0;\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\n// Global variables for memo and N\nlong long **memo;\nint N;\n\nlong long dfs(int current, int last3_idx) {\n    if (memo[current][last3_idx] != -1) return memo[current][last3_idx];\n    if (current == N) return 1;\n\n    char last3[4];\n    get_last3_str(last3_idx, last3);\n\n    long long res = 0;\n    // Iterate over all possible next characters (A, C, G, T)\n    for (int c_num=0; c_num<4; c_num++) {\n        char c = num_to_char(c_num);\n        char four[5] = {last3[0], last3[1], last3[2], c, '\\0'};\n        if (isOK(four)) {\n            // new last3 is last3[1], last3[2], c\n            char new_last3[4];\n            new_last3[0] = last3[1];\n            new_last3[1] = last3[2];\n            new_last3[2] = c;\n            new_last3[3] = '\\0';\n            int new_idx = str_to_index(new_last3);\n            res += dfs(current +1, new_idx);\n            res %= MOD;\n        }\n    }\n    memo[current][last3_idx] = res % MOD;\n    return res % MOD;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\n    // Allocate memo\n    memo = malloc( (N+1)*sizeof(long long*) );\n    for (int i=0; i<=N; i++) {\n        memo[i] = calloc(64, sizeof(long long));\n        for (int j=0; j<64; j++) {\n            memo[i][j] = -1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Compute initial index\n    char initial_last3[4] = \"TTT\";\n    int initial_idx = str_to_index(initial_last3);\n\n    long long result = dfs(0, initial_idx);\n\n    // Convert result to string\n    char num_str[20];\n    sprintf(num_str, \"%lld\", result);\n\n    // Second part processing: uppercase/lowercase\n    int uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0;\n    for (int i=0; num_str[i]; i++) {\n        char ch = num_str[i];\n        if (isupper(ch)) uppercase++;\n        else if (islower(ch)) lowercase++;\n    }\n    char *processed_str;\n    if (uppercase > lowercase) {\n        processed_str = strdup(strtoupper(num_str));\n    } else {\n        processed_str = strdup(strlower(num_str));\n    }\n\n    // Third part processing: replace commas with spaces\n    char *final_str = strdup(processed_str);\n    for (char *p = final_str; *p != '\\0'; p++) {\n        if (*p == ',') *p = ' ';\n    }\n\n    // Output the final string\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", final_str);\n\n    // Free allocated memory\n    free(processed_str);\n    free(final_str);\n    for (int i=0; i<=N; i++) free(memo[i]);\n    free(memo);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, there are no built-in functions like strtoupper or strlower. So I need to implement those.\n\nAh right, so I need to write functions to convert a string to uppercase or lowercase.\n\nAlternatively, process each character:\n\nFor the second part:\n\nchar *processed_str;\nif (uppercase > lowercase) {\n    processed_str = strdup(num_str);\n    for (int i=0; processed_str[i]; i++) {\n        processed_str[i] = toupper(processed_str[i]);\n    }\n} else {\n    processed_str = strdup(num_str);\n    for (int i=0; processed_str[i]; i++) {\n        processed_str[i] = tolower(processed_str[i]);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the original Java code uses Character.isUpperCase, which includes uppercase letters. Since the input is a number's string, which has only digits, the uppercase and lowercase counts would be zero. So the processed_str would be the lowercase version (same as original).\n\nBut in C, the digits are neither uppercase nor lowercase, so the counts would be zero. So the code would choose lowercase.\n\nThus, the processed_str is the same as the original string (since digits are already lowercase).\n\nThen, the third part replaces commas with spaces. Since there are no commas, the final_str is the same as processed_str.\n\nThus, the final output is the same as the first program's output as a string.\n\nBut the code must be written correctly.\n\nNow, let's check the code for errors.\n\nFirst, in the main function:\n\nWhen converting the result to a string, using sprintf with %lld is correct for long long.\n\nThe initial_idx is computed correctly.\n\nThe dfs function uses the global N and memo.\n\nThe memo is initialized to -1 correctly.\n\nThe dfs function's loop over c_num from 0 to 3 (A, C, G, T).\n\nThe new_last3 is formed correctly.\n\nThe isOK function is correct.\n\nThe second part's processing:\n\nThe code uses isupper and islower functions from ctype.h. So need to include <ctype.h>.\n\nAlso, strdup is used, which requires including <string.h>.\n\nThe code uses strdup, but in C, strdup is not standard, but commonly available. Alternatively, allocate memory and copy.\n\nAlternatively, use malloc and strcpy.\n\nFor example:\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) {\n    processed_str = malloc(strlen(num_str)+1);\n    strcpy(processed_str, num_str);\n    for (int i=0; processed_str[i]; i++) {\n        processed_str[i] = toupper(processed_str[i]);\n    }\n} else {\n    // similar for lowercase\n}\n\nBut to be safe, better to avoid strdup.\n\nAlso, the third part's processing:\n\nchar *final_str = strdup(processed_str);\n\nThen replace commas with spaces.\n\nAlternatively, process in place:\n\nchar *final_str = strdup(processed_str);\nfor (char *p = final_str; *p != '\\0'; p++) {\n    if (*p == ',') *p = ' ';\n}\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n#define MOD 1000000007LL\n\n// ... all the helper functions as before ...\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\n    // Allocate memo\n    memo = malloc( (N+1)*sizeof(long long*) );\n    for (int i=0; i<=N; i++) {\n        memo[i] = calloc(64, sizeof(long long));\n        for (int j=0; j<64; j++) {\n            memo[i][j] = -1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    char initial_last3[4] = \"TTT\";\n    int initial_idx = str_to_index(initial_last3);\n\n    long long result = dfs(0, initial_idx);\n\n    char num_str[20];\n    sprintf(num_str, \"%lld\", result);\n\n    // Second part processing\n    int uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0;\n    for (int i=0; num_str[i]; i++) {\n        char ch = num_str[i];\n        if (isupper(ch)) uppercase++;\n        else if (islower(ch)) lowercase++;\n    }\n\n    char *processed_str;\n    if (uppercase > lowercase) {\n        processed_str = malloc(strlen(num_str)+1);\n        strcpy(processed_str, num_str);\n        for (int i=0; processed_str[i]; i++) {\n            processed_str[i] = toupper(processed_str[i]);\n        }\n    } else {\n        processed_str = malloc(strlen(num_str)+1);\n        strcpy(processed_str, num_str);\n        for (int i=0; processed_str[i]; i++) {\n            processed_str[i] = tolower(processed_str[i]);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Third part processing\n    char *final_str = malloc(strlen(processed_str)+1);\n    strcpy(final_str, processed_str);\n    for (char *p = final_str; *p != '\\0'; p++) {\n        if (*p == ',') *p = ' ';\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", final_str);\n\n    // Free memory\n    free(final_str);\n    free(processed_str);\n    for (int i=0; i<=N; i++) free(memo[i]);\n    free(memo);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part's code, the dfs function uses the global N and memo. So the dfs function must be declared before main, and the global variables must be declared outside.\n\nAlso, the memo is a global variable declared as:\n\nlong long **memo;\nint N;\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nBut there's a potential issue with the recursion depth. For example, if N is 20, the recursion depth is 20, which is okay. But if N is larger, like 1000, the stack might overflow. However, given that the original Java code uses recursion, perhaps the problem's constraints allow this.\n\nAnother possible issue is the memo array's size. For N=1e5, the code would require 1e5 * 64 entries, which is 6.4e6 elements, each 8 bytes (long long), totaling ~51MB, which is manageable. But with dynamic allocation, it's okay.\n\nThus, this should be the correct translation."
