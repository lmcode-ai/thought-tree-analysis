Second Java program (File 2):\n\n- Reads a string s (the entire line), then outputs the first character of s incremented by 1 (as a character). So if the input is \"123\", it outputs '2'. Wait, the code in File 2 is:\n\ns = r.readLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1); So the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a number (like 12345.67). So when the first program outputs, say, 12345.67, that's a string like \"12345.67\\n\", so the second program reads that as the input string.

So the third program's input is the output of the second, which is a single character (like '2'), so the third program reads that as a number (2), and processes it. The third program's code: It reads a number (number = in.nextLong()), then loops to find the smallest number made of 4 and 7 (with equal number of 4 and 7 digits?), but the code is a bit more involved. Let me see:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nlong number = in.nextLong();\nlong ans = -1, value = 0;\nint mask = 2;\nwhile (value < number) {\n    String s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n    int zeros = 0;\n    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) if (c == '0') zeros++; if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue; // must have equal 0 and 1?\n    s = s.replace('0', '4');\n    s = s.replace('1', '7');\n    value = Long.parseLong(s);\n}\nSystem.out.println(value); Wait, the mask starts at 2, and the binary string is taken, then substring(1) removes the first character. So for mask=2 (binary 10), substring(1) is \"0\". Then the zeros count is 1, length is 1, so zeros (1) must equal the number of 1s (0). So 1 != 0 \u2192 skip. Hmm, maybe the condition is that the number of zeros equals the number of ones? Because zeros must equal (length - zeros). So zeros == (length - zeros) \u2192 total length even?\n\nWait the condition is if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) \u2192 continue. So only proceed if zeros equals s.length() - zeros. So the number of 0s must equal the number of 1s. So the binary string (after substring) must have equal 0s and 1s. So the length must be even, and exactly half 0 and 1. The mask starts at 2, and increments. The binary string is of mask, then substring(1) removes the first character. So mask starts at 2 (binary 10 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0\"), mask=3 (11 \u2192 substring is \"1\"), mask=4 (100 \u2192 substring is \"00\"), etc. The loop continues until value (the parsed number) is >= the input number. The first such value is printed. Wait, the loop is while (value < number). So the loop runs as long as value is less than the input. The code is trying to find the smallest number made of 4 and 7 digits (with equal number of 4 and 7 digits?), such that it is >= the input number.",

So if the second step's output is a non-digit character (like ':'), then the third step would fail. But according to the original Java code, the second program's output is a character, which is then read as a long by the third program. So if the second program's output is a non-digit, the third program would throw an error. But the problem says that the C program must behave identically, so we have to handle that. But perhaps the problem's test cases ensure that the first character is a digit. Let's proceed under that assumption for now, but in code, we need to handle it properly.",

Now, the third step's processing is to find the minimal number made of 4 and 7 digits with equal number of 4 and 7, and the number is >= the input (which is the numeric value of c2). Wait, the third program's code is a bit complex. Let me re-express it in C.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nlong number = input (from second step's output's numeric value). long ans = -1, value = 0;\n\nint mask = 2;\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n    String s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\n    int zeros = 0;\n\n    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) if (c == '0') zeros++;\n\n    if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\n\n    s = s.replace('0', '4');\n\n    s = s.replace('1', '7');\n\n    value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(value); So the loop increments mask starting at 2.

However, given the problem's constraints, perhaps it's manageable. Putting all together, the C program must:\n\n1. Read N and N lines of x and u.\n\n2. Compute the sum as per first Java program. 3. Convert the sum to a string as Java would, take first character, add 1, get c2. 4. Convert c2 to its numeric value (e.g., '2' \u2192 2). 5. Process that numeric value through the third step's logic to find the desired value.",

But in C, the value of DBL_DECIMAL_DIG is defined in float.h. For example, it's 17 for IEEE doubles. So:\n\nsprintf(buffer, \"%.*g \", DBL_DECIMAL_DIG, sum);\n\nThis should give the shortest representation that can be parsed back to the same double, similar to Java's Double.toString(). Then, the first character of this buffer is what we need. So in code:\n\nchar buffer[100];\n\nsprintf(buffer, \"%.*g \", DBL_DECIMAL_DIG, sum);\n\nchar first_char = buffer[0];\n\nThen, the second step's output is first_char + 1. But need to ensure that buffer is properly formatted. Once we have first_char, the third step's input is the numeric value of (first_char + 1). For example, if first_char is '1', then the input is 2. Wait, but first_char + 1 is a char, so to get its numeric value, we can cast to int:\n\nint input_num = (first_char + 1) - '0'; Wait, no. For example, if first_char is '1', then first_char +1 is '2', so the numeric value is '2' - '0' = 2. Yes. So input_num = (first_char + 1) - '0';\n\nWait, but first_char could be '.' or 'e' (from scientific notation).",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC119_B) reads N lines of input where each line has a number and a unit (JPY or something else). It calculates the sum of each number multiplied by 1 if the unit is JPY, else 380000. The output is this sum.\n\nThe second file (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes a string input, then outputs the first character incremented by 1. Wait, but how does this connect? The output of the first program is the input to the second? Wait, no, the problem says the output of each is input to the next. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string input (since it reads a line). Hmm, maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as the input to the second program. But the second program's input is a string, so perhaps the first's output is a number, which is then converted to a string and passed as the second's input. But in the sequence, the first's output is the second's input, so the second program would read that number as a string. Wait, but the second program's code is taking a single character from the first character of the input string. For example, if the first program outputs \"1234\", then the second program would take the first character '1' (ASCII 49), add 1 to get 50 which is '2', so output '2'. But then the third program would take that output as input?\n\nWait, the third program (codeforces_96_B) reads a number from input. So the second program's output is a single character (like '2'), which is then the input to the third program. But the third program expects a number. Wait, that might not make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe user says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. The final C program must process all three steps in sequence, with only the first reading input, and the last producing output, and intermediate steps not doing I/O.\n\nWait, but the original Java programs are run in sequence, so the first's output is the second's input, and the second's output is the third's input. The C program must combine all three steps into one, so that the first step's data is read from stdin, then passed to the second step's processing, then to the third, and finally the third's result is printed.\n\nSo the C program must read the input for the first Java program, process it through all three steps, and output the final result of the third step.\n\nTherefore, I need to model each Java program's processing as functions in C, passing data between them without I/O in between.\n\nLet me break down each Java program's logic.\n\nFirst Java program (File 1):\n\n- Reads N, then N lines each with x[i] and u[i].\n- The solve function multiplies each x by 1 if u is \"JPY\", else 380000, sums all.\n- Output is the sum.\n\nSecond Java program (File 2):\n\n- Reads a string s (the entire line), then outputs the first character of s incremented by 1 (as a character). So if the input is \"123\", it outputs '2'.\n\nWait, the code in File 2 is:\n\ns = r.readLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a number (like 12345.67). So when the first program outputs, say, 12345.67, that's a string like \"12345.67\\n\", so the second program reads that as the input string. The first character is '1', so adding 1 gives '2', so the output is '2'.\n\nThird Java program (File 3):\n\n- Reads a long number from input. The input here is the output of the second program, which is a single character (like '2'). But that's a problem because the third program expects a number. Wait, this is a problem. Because the second program's output is a single character (like '2'), which is a string, so when the third program reads it as a long, it would parse \"2\" as 2, which is okay. So the third program's input is the output of the second, which is a single character (like '2'), so the third program reads that as a number (2), and processes it.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nIt reads a number (number = in.nextLong()), then loops to find the smallest number made of 4 and 7 (with equal number of 4 and 7 digits?), but the code is a bit more involved. Let me see:\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nlong number = in.nextLong();\nlong ans = -1, value = 0;\nint mask = 2;\nwhile (value < number) {\n    String s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n    int zeros = 0;\n    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) if (c == '0') zeros++;\n    if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue; // must have equal 0 and 1?\n    s = s.replace('0', '4');\n    s = s.replace('1', '7');\n    value = Long.parseLong(s);\n}\nSystem.out.println(value);\n\nWait, the mask starts at 2, and the binary string is taken, then substring(1) removes the first character. So for mask=2 (binary 10), substring(1) is \"0\". Then the zeros count is 1, length is 1, so zeros (1) must equal the number of 1s (0). So 1 != 0 \u2192 skip. Hmm, maybe the condition is that the number of zeros equals the number of ones? Because zeros must equal (length - zeros). So zeros == (length - zeros) \u2192 total length even?\n\nWait the condition is if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) \u2192 continue. So only proceed if zeros equals s.length() - zeros. So the number of 0s must equal the number of 1s. So the binary string (after substring) must have equal 0s and 1s. So the length must be even, and exactly half 0 and 1.\n\nThe mask starts at 2, and increments. The binary string is of mask, then substring(1) removes the first character. So mask starts at 2 (binary 10 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0\"), mask=3 (11 \u2192 substring is \"1\"), mask=4 (100 \u2192 substring is \"00\"), etc.\n\nThe loop continues until value (the parsed number) is >= the input number. The first such value is printed.\n\nWait, the loop is while (value < number). So the loop runs as long as value is less than the input. The code is trying to find the smallest number made of 4 and 7 digits (with equal number of 4 and 7 digits?), such that it is >= the input number. The value is the number formed by replacing 0 with 4 and 1 with 7 in the binary string (after substring(1)), but only when the binary string (after substring) has equal 0 and 1 counts.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky, but I need to model this in C.\n\nNow, the C program must read the input for the first Java program (N and N lines of x and u), process through all three steps, and output the final result of the third step.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N, then N pairs of x and u. Compute the sum as per first Java program.\n\n2. Take that sum, convert it to a string (as the first program's output would be a number, which is printed as a string with a newline?), then pass that to the second step. The second step takes the first character of that string, adds 1, and outputs that character (as a single character string).\n\n3. The third step takes that character (like '2') as input (as a number, parsed as a long), and processes it to find the desired value.\n\nWait, but in the second step's output, the first character is taken from the first program's output. For example, if the first program outputs \"1234.56\", then the second program's input is that string, so the first character is '1', so the output is '2'. The third program then reads that '2' as a number (so 2), and processes it.\n\nSo the C program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first step (N and N lines of x and u).\n\n- Compute the sum (first step's result).\n\n- Then, process that sum through the second step's logic (convert to string, take first character, add 1, get the new character).\n\n- Then, process that character (as a number, like its ASCII value?) Wait no, the third program reads it as a long. Wait, the second program's output is a single character, like '2', which is written to stdout. The third program would read that as a string, then parse it as a long. So the input to the third program is the character '2', which is the string \"2\\n\" (assuming the second program's output is followed by a newline). So the third program would read \"2\" as the input, so the number is 2.\n\nWait, the second Java program's code uses System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...), which would output the character followed by a newline? Or not? The printf with %c just outputs the character, but in Java, the System.out.println would add a newline, but here it's using printf without a newline. Wait, the code is:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo that would output the character, but no newline. So the output is just the single character, like '2', and then the third program reads that as input. So when the third program reads the input, it's the single character followed by a newline? Or not? Well, in Java, the first program's output is printed with System.out.println(solve(...)), which adds a newline. Wait, looking back at the first Java program's code:\n\nIn the first file, the main method ends with System.out.println(solve(x, u)); which adds a newline. So the first program's output is the sum followed by a newline. Then the second program reads that entire line (the sum plus the newline?), but in the second program's code, it uses readLine(), which reads until the newline. So the input to the second program is the sum as a string (including the newline?), but readLine() would read up to the newline and exclude it. So the string s in the second program is the sum's string (without the newline). Then the second program outputs the first character plus 1, as a character (without a newline?), because the printf is just %c. So the second program's output is a single character (like '2') with no newline. Then the third program reads that as input. But in the third program's code, it uses Scanner's nextLong(), which reads the entire token (so the single character '2' is a token, so it parses as 2. But if there's no newline, maybe the input is just the character, but the third program would read it as a number.\n\nHmm, but in the C program, I need to model all steps without I/O in between. So the first step's output is the sum (a double). The second step takes that sum, converts it to a string (as it would be printed by the first Java program's println), then takes the first character of that string, adds 1, and that becomes the input to the third step. The third step then takes that character (as a number, like the ASCII value?), no, wait no. Wait the third program's input is the output of the second, which is a single character (like '2'), so the third program reads that as a string, parses it as a long. So the third program's input is the character '2', which is the string \"2\" (without a newline?), so the third program would read that as 2.\n\nWait, but in the first program's output, the sum is printed with a newline. So the second program's input is the sum's string followed by a newline. The second program reads the entire line (the sum's string), then takes the first character. So the first character is the first digit of the sum. For example, if the sum is 1234.56, then the string is \"1234.56\", so first character is '1', so the second program outputs '2'. The third program then reads that '2' as input, so the input is \"2\" (without a newline?), but the third program's scanner would read that as a long (2).\n\nSo in the C program, the steps are:\n\n1. Read N and the N pairs of x and u.\n\n2. Compute the sum (first step's result).\n\n3. Convert the sum to a string (as it would be printed by the first Java program's println). The exact string representation is important here. Since Java's println for a double would format it with a decimal point, but perhaps in some locale-specific way. However, for the problem, we can assume that the first program's output is the sum as a string with a decimal point, and the second step takes the first character of that string.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program's solve function, the sum is a double. The code uses System.out.println(solve(...)), so the double is printed as per Java's default formatting. For example, if the sum is an integer like 123, it would print \"123.0\" or \"123\"? Wait, Java's Double.toString() for an integer value would print it as \"123.0\"? Or does it print as \"123\" when the decimal is .0?\n\nWait, let me check. For example, if the sum is exactly 123, then Double.toString(123.0) would be \"123.0\". But if the sum is an integer, but the calculation could have fractions, but in some cases it's an integer. So the first character would be '1' in that case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is printed with a decimal point, so the first character is the first digit before the decimal. So the second step's input is the first character of that string.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, after computing the sum (as a double), we need to format it as a string exactly as the first Java program would, then take the first character of that string, add 1, and pass that to the third step.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Because the string representation of the double in Java might differ from C's default. For example, in C, printing with %f would give more decimal digits, but Java might use a different format. Wait, but the first Java program's code uses System.out.println(solve(...)), which for a double would use the default formatting. The default for Double.toString() in Java is to return the shortest string that uniquely identifies the value. For example, for an integer value like 123.0, it would print \"123.0\", but for an integer like 123, it would be \"123.0\"? Wait, no. Wait, the value is a double. So 123.0 is a double, and Double.toString(123.0) returns \"123.0\". But if the value is an integer, like 123, but stored as a double, it would still be \"123.0\".\n\nWait, but in the first Java program's solve function, the sum is computed as a double. So even if the sum is an integer, it would be represented as a double with .0. So the string would have a decimal point. So the first character is the first digit before the decimal.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, when converting the sum to a string, we need to format it in the same way as Java's Double.toString(). To replicate that, perhaps we can format it with one decimal place, but that might not be sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps the first character is the first digit of the number, regardless of decimal points. For example, if the sum is 1234.56, the first character is '1'; if it's 0.123, the first character is '0'; if it's -123, the first character is '-', but in the problem's context, the sum is a sum of positive numbers (since x is multiplied by 380000 or 1, so the sum is non-negative). So the first character is either a digit or '.'? Wait, no, if the sum is less than 1, like 0.5, then the string would be \"0.5\", so first character is '0'. If the sum is 0.0, then \"0.0\".\n\nTherefore, in C, to get the same string representation as Java's Double.toString(), perhaps we can use a format that matches. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first character is the first digit of the number, ignoring any leading zeros or signs. But given that the problem is about code translation, perhaps the exact string representation must be matched. However, this could be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the first step's output is a double, and the second step's processing is to take the first character of its string representation (as per Java's formatting), add 1, and pass that as a character to the third step.\n\nIn C, to replicate the first step's output string, perhaps we can use sprintf with a format that matches Java's. Let me think: Java's Double.toString() for a double d returns the shortest string that can parse back to d. For example:\n\n- For integer values (d is an integer), it appends .0. So 123 \u2192 \"123.0\".\n\n- For numbers with fractional parts, it shows all necessary digits. For example, 123.45 \u2192 \"123.45\".\n\n- For numbers with exponents (like very large or small), it uses scientific notation, but in the problem's context, since the sum is a sum of x[i] * 380000 or 1, perhaps the numbers are manageable without exponents.\n\nTherefore, in C, to format the sum as a string like Java does, perhaps using \"%.15g\" to get a reasonable representation, but that might not exactly match. Alternatively, perhaps the first character is the first non-whitespace character of the string representation. Since the first program's output is printed with System.out.println, which adds a newline, but the second program reads the entire line (so the newline is not part of the string). So the string s in the second program is the sum's string without the newline.\n\nTherefore, in C, after computing the sum, we can format it into a string using a format that matches Java's Double.toString(). To do this accurately, perhaps the best approach is to use the same logic as Java's Double.toString(). But that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first character is the first digit of the number, so for example, if the sum is 1234.56, the first character is '1', so the second step's output is '2', which is then the input to the third step as 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step's output is a number, and the second step's processing is to take the first character of its string representation (as printed by the first program), add 1, and pass that as a character. The third step then reads that character as a number (like '2' is 2).\n\nTherefore, in the C program, after computing the sum, we can:\n\n- Convert the sum to a string in the same way as Java's Double.toString().\n\n- Take the first character of that string.\n\n- Add 1 to its ASCII value (so '1' becomes '2', etc.), then that becomes the input to the third step.\n\nWait, but the third step's input is a number. The third program reads a long, so the input must be a number. The second step's output is a single character (like '2'), so the third program reads that as a string, parses it as a long (so '2' becomes 2).\n\nTherefore, in the C program, the second step's processing is to take the first character of the sum's string, add 1, then that character is the input to the third step. The third step's input is that character's numeric value (as a string, so '2' is parsed as 2).\n\nTherefore, in C, after getting the sum, we need to:\n\n1. Convert the sum to a string as Java would.\n\n2. Take the first character of that string (c).\n\n3. The next value is (c + 1) as a character. Wait, no, the second step's code is s.charAt(0) + 1, then printed as a character. So if the first character is '1', then adding 1 gives '2', so the output is '2'.\n\nSo the third step's input is the character '2', which is read as a long (so 2).\n\nTherefore, in C, the third step's input is the ASCII value of the character (c + 1). Wait no, the third program reads the input as a number. The second program's output is the character (like '2'), so the third program's input is the string \"2\" (assuming the second program's output is followed by a newline?), so the third program reads that as a long (2).\n\nWait, but in the second program's code, the output is System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...), which outputs the character without a newline. So the output is just the character, and then the third program reads that as input. So the input to the third program is the single character followed by whatever is next. But in the sequence, the second program's output is the input to the third, so the third program's input is the single character (like '2'), which is read as a long. So the third program's scanner would read that as a token, which is the character's ASCII code? No, no. The input is the character '2', which is the string \"2\" (since the character is written to stdout as a single character, but when read by the third program, it's a single '2' character, which is a valid number. So the third program parses it as 2.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, the third step's input is the ASCII value of the character (c + 1) converted to a number. Wait no, the character is '2', which is the character code 50, but when parsed as a number, it's 2. So the third step's input is the numeric value of the character (as a string). So in C, the third step's input is the character (c + 1), which is a char, but we need to pass it as a string to the third step's processing.\n\nWait, in the C program, the steps are all in memory. So after the first step computes the sum, we need to:\n\n- Convert the sum to a string (as Java would).\n\n- Take the first character (c).\n\n- The next value is (c + 1) as a character (so the second step's output is this character).\n\n- The third step's input is the numeric value of that character (as a string). So the third step's input is the character's value as a number. For example, if the second step's output is '2', then the third step's input is 2.\n\nTherefore, in C, the third step's input is the numeric value of the character (c + 1). So the third step's input is (c + 1) - '0' (if it's a digit). Wait, but the first character of the sum's string could be a '.' or a digit. For example, if the sum is 0.5, the first character is '0', so adding 1 gives '1', so the third step's input is 1. If the sum is 0.0, then first character is '0', so the third step's input is 1. If the sum is 123.45, first character is '1', so third input is 2. If the sum is 999.99, first character is '9', so third input is 10? Wait, but '9' + 1 is ':', which is not a digit. Wait, but in that case, the third program would read the input as a long. If the second program's output is ':', then the third program would read that as a string, which is not a number, so it would throw an error. But according to the problem's original code, perhaps the input to the third program is always a valid number. So perhaps the first character is always a digit. Because the first program's output is a sum of numbers, which is non-negative. So the first character is either '0' to '9', or '.' if the sum is less than 1. Wait, but if the sum is 0.5, the first character is '0', so adding 1 gives '1', which is okay. If the sum is 0.0, first character is '0', so '1'. If the sum is 0.123, first character is '0', so '1'. If the sum is 0.0, then the string is \"0.0\", so first character is '0'.\n\nWait, but if the sum is 0.0, then the first character is '0', so the second step's output is '1', which is valid. So the third step's input is 1. So the third program would process that.\n\nBut if the first character is '.' (like if the sum is 0.5, but the string is \"0.5\", so first character is '0', not '.'). Wait, the sum can't be less than zero, so the first character can't be a '-'. So the first character is either a digit (0-9) or '.'? Wait, no. For example, if the sum is 0.5, the string is \"0.5\", so first character is '0'. If the sum is 0.0, it's \"0.0\". If the sum is 0.0000001, it would be \"1.0E-7\" (scientific notation?), but in that case, the first character is '1'. Wait, but Java's Double.toString() for very small numbers may use scientific notation. For example, 0.0000001 is 1e-7, so the string would be \"1.0E-7\", so first character is '1'.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Because if the sum is very small, the string could start with '1' (from the scientific notation), leading to the second step's output being '2', which is okay. But the third program would read that as 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases ensure that the first character is a digit. But since we have to handle all cases, we need to account for any possible first character.\n\nBut in the C program, the third step's input is the numeric value of the character (c + 1). So if the second step's output is a non-digit character (like ':'), then the third step would fail. But according to the original Java code, the second program's output is a character, which is then read as a long by the third program. So if the second program's output is a non-digit, the third program would throw an error. But the problem says that the C program must behave identically, so we have to handle that.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's test cases ensure that the first character is a digit. Let's proceed under that assumption for now, but in code, we need to handle it properly.\n\nSo, in the C program:\n\nFirst step: compute the sum as per the first Java program.\n\nSecond step: convert the sum to a string as Java would, take first character, add 1, get the new character (char c2).\n\nThird step: process c2 as a number (its numeric value as a string, e.g., '2' \u2192 2).\n\nNow, the third step's processing is to find the minimal number made of 4 and 7 digits with equal number of 4 and 7, and the number is >= the input (which is the numeric value of c2).\n\nWait, the third program's code is a bit complex. Let me re-express it in C.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nlong number = input (from second step's output's numeric value).\n\nlong ans = -1, value = 0;\n\nint mask = 2;\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n    String s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\n    int zeros = 0;\n\n    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) if (c == '0') zeros++;\n\n    if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\n\n    s = s.replace('0', '4');\n\n    s = s.replace('1', '7');\n\n    value = Long.parseLong(s);\n\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(value);\n\nSo the loop increments mask starting at 2. For each mask, it converts to binary, takes substring(1) (so removes the first character), then counts the number of zeros. If the number of zeros equals the number of ones (since zeros must equal length - zeros \u2192 total length even?), then proceed. Then replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parse as a long, and check if it's >= the input number. The first such value is printed.\n\nThe mask starts at 2, so mask=2 \u2192 binary is \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\". The zeros count is 1, length is 1 \u2192 1 != 0 \u2192 skip.\n\nmask=3 \u2192 binary \"11\" \u2192 substring(1) is \"1\". zeros=0, length 1 \u2192 0 !=1 \u2192 skip.\n\nmask=4 \u2192 binary \"100\" \u2192 substring(1) is \"00\". zeros=2, length 2 \u2192 2 == 0 \u2192 no, wait 2 == (2-2) \u2192 2 == 0? No. Wait zeros is 2, length is 2 \u2192 zeros (2) must equal (length - zeros) \u2192 2 vs 0 \u2192 no. So skip.\n\nmask=5 \u2192 binary \"101\" \u2192 substring(1) is \"01\". zeros=1, length 2 \u2192 1 == 1 \u2192 yes. So s is \"01\" \u2192 replaced to \"47\" \u2192 47. So value is 47. If the input number is 47, then it would be the first value.\n\nSo the loop continues until value >= number.\n\nThe third program's task is to find the smallest number composed of 4 and 7 digits with equal number of 4 and 7 (since the binary substring has equal 0 and 1 counts?), such that the number is >= the input.\n\nWait, the condition is that the number of zeros equals the number of ones in the substring. So the length must be even, and exactly half 0 and 1. So the resulting string after replacing has equal 4 and 7 digits.\n\nTherefore, the third step's processing is to find the minimal such number >= the input.\n\nIn C, to implement this:\n\nWe need to loop mask starting from 2, and for each mask:\n\n- Convert mask to binary string.\n\n- Take substring starting at index 1 (i.e., remove first character).\n\n- Count the number of '0's in this substring.\n\n- If the count of zeros is equal to the length of the substring minus zeros (i.e., zeros == (length - zeros)), then proceed.\n\n- Replace '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's to form the new string.\n\n- Parse this string as a long (value).\n\n- If value >= number, then return it.\n\nThe loop continues until such a value is found.\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\nInitialize mask = 2.\n\nLoop:\n\n- Convert mask to binary string (without leading zeros?), but in C, we can generate the binary string.\n\nWait, in Java, Integer.toBinaryString(mask) returns the binary representation without leading zeros. For example, mask=2 is 10, so the string is \"10\".\n\nThen substring(1) is from index 1 (the second character), so for \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\".\n\nSo in C, for a given mask, we need to:\n\n1. Convert mask to a binary string (without leading zeros).\n\n2. Remove the first character (substring(1)).\n\n3. Count the number of '0's in the remaining string.\n\n4. Check if zeros == (length - zeros).\n\n5. If yes, replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927, then parse as a number.\n\n6. Compare with the input number.\n\nSo in C, the steps for the third part are:\n\nWe can write a helper function to generate the binary string of mask, then process as above.\n\nFirst, to get the binary string of mask (as an integer). Since mask starts at 2 and increments, it's an integer. So in C, we can generate the binary string.\n\nFunction to get binary string of an integer:\n\nchar* int_to_binary(int n) {\n\n    // ... code to generate binary string.\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the bits and build the string.\n\nAlternatively, since mask can be up to a large number, but in practice, the loop may not run too long, but for the problem's constraints, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, in C, for a given mask, we can compute the binary digits, then process them.\n\nLet me think of the steps in code.\n\nFirst, the third step's input is the numeric value of the second step's output (c2). Let's call this input_num.\n\nWe need to loop mask from 2 upwards until we find the first value >= input_num.\n\nInitialize mask = 2.\n\nLoop:\n\nCompute the binary string of mask, then substring(1).\n\nTo get the binary string of mask:\n\nWe can compute it by shifting and checking bits.\n\nFor example, for mask:\n\nchar bin_str[33]; // since mask can be up to 2^31, so 32 bits plus null.\n\nint len = 0;\n\nint temp = mask;\n\ndo {\n\n    bin_str[len++] = (temp % 2) + '0';\n\n    temp /= 2;\n\n} while (temp > 0);\n\n// Now, the binary string is in reverse order. So reverse it.\n\nbin_str[len] = '\\0';\n\nstrrev(bin_str); // but need to reverse the array.\n\nWait, but this would give the binary string as a string, but in the correct order.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor mask=2 (binary 10):\n\ntemp starts as 2.\n\nLoop:\n\ntemp %2 \u2192 0 \u2192 bin_str[0] = '0'\n\ntemp becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration:\n\ntemp%2 \u21921 \u2192 bin_str[1] = '1'\n\ntemp becomes 0.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nlen is 2.\n\nThen, the bin_str is \"01\" (since the first character is '0', then '1'), but after reversing, it becomes \"10\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code above appends the least significant bit first. So the array after the loop is ['0', '1', ...], but when reversed, it becomes \"10\".\n\nYes. So the code would generate the correct binary string.\n\nThen, substring(1) is the string starting from index 1 (the second character). So for \"10\", substring(1) is \"0\".\n\nSo the substring is bin_str[1] to end.\n\nWait, in C, the substring can be handled by pointing to bin_str[1].\n\nSo the substring is from index 1 to the end.\n\nThen, count the number of '0's in this substring.\n\nThe length of the substring is (len -1) characters (since we removed the first character).\n\nThen, check if zeros == (length - zeros).\n\nIf yes, then create the new string by replacing '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's.\n\nThen, parse that as a long.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor (mask = 2; ; mask++) {\n\n    // generate binary string of mask.\n\n    char bin_str[33];\n\n    int len = 0;\n\n    int temp = mask;\n\n    do {\n\n        bin_str[len++] = (temp % 2) + '0';\n\n        temp /= 2;\n\n    } while (temp > 0);\n\n    bin_str[len] = '\\0';\n\n    // reverse the string to get correct order.\n\n    for (int i = 0, j = len-1; i < j; i++, j--) {\n\n        char t = bin_str[i];\n\n        bin_str[i] = bin_str[j];\n\n        bin_str[j] = t;\n\n    }\n\n    // substring(1) is from index 1 to end.\n\n    char *sub = bin_str + 1;\n\n    int sub_len = len -1;\n\n    if (sub_len == 0) continue; // because then zeros can't equal (0 - zeros) ?\n\n    int zeros = 0;\n\n    for (int i =0; i < sub_len; i++) {\n\n        if (sub[i] == '0') zeros++;\n\n    }\n\n    if (zeros != (sub_len - zeros)) {\n\n        continue;\n\n    }\n\n    // Now, create the new string.\n\n    char new_str[sub_len +1];\n\n    for (int i=0; i < sub_len; i++) {\n\n        if (sub[i] == '0') new_str[i] = '4';\n\n        else new_str[i] = '7';\n\n    }\n\n    new_str[sub_len] = '\\0';\n\n    // parse to long.\n\n    long value = atoll(new_str);\n\n    if (value >= input_num) {\n\n        // return this value.\n\n        printf(\"%ld\\n\", value);\n\n        exit(0);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in C, the mask can be up to a very large number, but the loop may take time. However, given the problem's constraints, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nPutting all together, the C program must:\n\n1. Read N and N lines of x and u.\n\n2. Compute the sum as per first Java program.\n\n3. Convert the sum to a string as Java would, take first character, add 1, get c2.\n\n4. Convert c2 to its numeric value (e.g., '2' \u2192 2).\n\n5. Process that numeric value through the third step's logic to find the desired value.\n\nNow, the first step's sum computation:\n\nThe first Java program's solve function multiplies each x[i] by 1 if u[i] is \"JPY\", else 380000, then sums all.\n\nIn C, we can read N, then for each of N lines, read a double and a string (u). For each, multiply the double by 1 or 380000, sum all.\n\nThe strings u can be read as a string (e.g., using fgets or scanf with %s).\n\nBut in C, handling variable-length strings can be tricky. Since the u can be either \"JPY\" or other strings, but only \"JPY\" is considered as 1, others as 380000.\n\nSo for each u string, check if it is \"JPY\".\n\nIn C, to read the strings, perhaps using scanf with %s for the u strings.\n\nBut need to read the x and u correctly. For each line, the input is a double followed by a string (without space?), but in Java, the code uses sc.nextDouble() and sc.next(), which reads the next token. So in C, using scanf with \"%lf %s\" would work, as long as the string is not space-containing. Since the problem's input for the first program's u is either \"JPY\" or another unit (like \"BTC\" or something), which are single tokens.\n\nSo in C:\n\nRead N, then loop N times:\n\ndouble x_i;\n\nchar u[10]; // assuming the unit is not longer than 9 chars.\n\nscanf(\"%lf %9s\", &x_i, u);\n\nsum += x_i * (strcmp(u, \"JPY\") == 0 ? 1.0 : 380000.0);\n\nOnce the sum is computed, proceed to the second step.\n\nNow, converting the sum to a string as Java's Double.toString().\n\nThis is the tricky part. To replicate the string exactly, perhaps we can use sprintf with a format that matches Java's output.\n\nJava's Double.toString() for a double d:\n\n- If d is an integer (i.e., d has no fractional part), it appends .0.\n\n- Otherwise, it shows the shortest decimal representation.\n\nFor example:\n\nd = 123 \u2192 \"123.0\"\n\nd = 123.45 \u2192 \"123.45\"\n\nd = 123.4 \u2192 \"123.4\"\n\nd = 0.0 \u2192 \"0.0\"\n\nd = 0.123 \u2192 \"0.123\"\n\nd = 1234567890123456789.0 \u2192 \"1.234567890123456789E18\" (scientific notation?)\n\nWait, but for very large numbers, Java may use scientific notation. However, in the problem's context, perhaps the sum is manageable as a double without scientific notation. But to be precise, we need to handle all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first character is the first non-whitespace character of the string representation. To get the first character, perhaps we can use sprintf with a format that outputs the same as Java's Double.toString().\n\nAlternatively, use the following approach:\n\nIn C, to get the string representation as Java's Double.toString(), we can use the following steps:\n\n- If the double is an integer (i.e., (sum == (long)sum)), then format as \"%.1f\".\n\n- Else, format as \"%.15g\" to get a reasonable precision, but this may not exactly match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first character is the first digit of the number, ignoring decimal points and exponents. But this is not reliable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first character is the first digit of the number when printed in fixed decimal notation without scientific notation. For example, even if the number is large, it's printed as a fixed decimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step's output is printed with a decimal point, so the first character is the first digit before the decimal.\n\nAssuming that, perhaps in C, we can format the sum as a string with one decimal place, so that it appends .0 for integers. For example:\n\nsprintf(buffer, \"%.1f\", sum);\n\nThis would format 123 as \"123.0\", 123.45 as \"123.4\", 0.5 as \"0.5\", etc. But this may not exactly match Java's output, but perhaps it's sufficient for the problem's test cases.\n\nWait, but in Java, 123.4 would be \"123.4\", and 123.45 would be \"123.45\". So using \"%.1f\" would round to one decimal place, which is not desired. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. To get the exact string as Java's Double.toString(), perhaps the best way is to use the following approach:\n\nJava's Double.toString() returns the shortest string that can be parsed back to the same double. To replicate this in C, perhaps we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the double is an integer (i.e., (sum == (long long)sum)). If yes, then format as \"%.0f\" (no decimal) but then append \".0\".\n\nWait, but that would give \"123.0\" for 123.0, which matches Java's output.\n\n2. Else, format with enough decimal places to represent the value uniquely.\n\nBut this is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases don't require exact string matching beyond the first character being a digit. For example, if the sum is 1234.56, the first character is '1', so the second step's output is '2', which is correct regardless of the rest of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first character is the first non-whitespace, non-decimal point character. For example, if the sum is 0.5, the string is \"0.5\", so first character is '0'. If the sum is 0.0, it's \"0.0\", first character '0'. If the sum is 123.45, first character '1'. If the sum is 1234567890123456789.0 (which is beyond double's precision), but in that case, the string would be in scientific notation, like \"1.234567890123456789E18\", so first character '1'.\n\nIn that case, the first character is the first digit of the number, ignoring any leading '.' or 'E'.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the first character can be obtained by:\n\n- Convert the sum to a string using a format that avoids scientific notation, then take the first non-whitespace, non-decimal point, non-exponent character.\n\nAlternatively, in C, to get the first character:\n\nWe can format the sum as a string with a format that avoids scientific notation, then scan for the first character that is a digit.\n\nFor example:\n\nsprintf(buffer, \"%.15g\", sum);\n\nThen, iterate through the buffer to find the first character that is a digit (ignoring any '+' or '-' signs, but since sum is non-negative, we can ignore signs).\n\nWait, but the problem's sum is non-negative, so no '-'.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Format the sum into a string with enough precision to avoid scientific notation.\n\n2. Iterate through the characters until the first digit is found.\n\n3. Take that as the first character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first non-whitespace character is the first character of the string.\n\nLet me try with some examples:\n\nExample 1: sum = 123.45 \u2192 buffer is \"123.45\" \u2192 first character '1'.\n\nExample 2: sum = 0.5 \u2192 \"0.5\" \u2192 first character '0'.\n\nExample 3: sum = 0.0 \u2192 \"0\" (if formatted as %.0f?), but with the previous approach, perhaps \"0.0\".\n\nWait, if we use \"%.15g\", then 0.0 would be \"0\".\n\nHmm, so in that case, the first character is '0'.\n\nExample 4: sum = 1234567890123456789.0 \u2192 which is beyond double's precision. The actual stored value may be 1.2345678901234567e+18, so the string would be \"1.2345678901234567e+18\" \u2192 first character '1'.\n\nSo in C, to format the sum as a string without scientific notation, perhaps using \"%.0f\" for integers and \"%.15g\" otherwise?\n\nAlternatively, use the following code:\n\nchar buffer[100];\n\nsprintf(buffer, \"%.*g\", DBL_DECIMAL_DIG, sum);\n\n// DBL_DECIMAL_DIG is the number of decimal digits needed to uniquely represent a double.\n\nBut in C, the value of DBL_DECIMAL_DIG is defined in float.h. For example, it's 17 for IEEE doubles.\n\nSo:\n\nsprintf(buffer, \"%.*g\", DBL_DECIMAL_DIG, sum);\n\nThis should give the shortest representation that can be parsed back to the same double, similar to Java's Double.toString().\n\nThen, the first character of this buffer is what we need.\n\nSo in code:\n\nchar buffer[100];\n\nsprintf(buffer, \"%.*g\", DBL_DECIMAL_DIG, sum);\n\nchar first_char = buffer[0];\n\nThen, the second step's output is first_char + 1.\n\nBut need to ensure that buffer is properly formatted.\n\nOnce we have first_char, the third step's input is the numeric value of (first_char + 1). For example, if first_char is '1', then the input is 2.\n\nWait, but first_char + 1 is a char, so to get its numeric value, we can cast to int:\n\nint input_num = (first_char + 1) - '0';\n\nWait, no. For example, if first_char is '1', then first_char +1 is '2', so the numeric value is '2' - '0' = 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo input_num = (first_char + 1) - '0';\n\nWait, but first_char could be '.' or 'e' (from scientific notation). For example, if the sum is 0.0000000000001, the string might be \"1e-13\", so first_char is '1', so input_num is 2. That's okay.\n\nIf the first_char is 'e', then first_char +1 is 'f', which is not a digit. Then input_num would be 'f' - '0' = 102 - 48 = 54, which is not a digit. But the third program would read that as a number? No, because 'f' is not a digit, so the third program would fail to parse it. But according to the problem's original code, the second program's output is a character, which is then read as a long by the third program. So if the second program outputs a non-digit, the third program would throw an error. But the problem requires the C program to behave identically, so we must handle that.\n\nHowever, in the problem's context, perhaps the first character is always a digit. Because the sum is a sum of non-negative numbers, so it's at least zero. So the first character is either '0' (if sum is 0 or between 0 and 1), or a digit from 1-9 (if sum is >=1).\n\nWait, if the sum is 0.0, the string is \"0\" (using the format %.*g with DBL_DECIMAL_DIG), so first_char is '0', so input_num is 1.\n\nIf the sum is 0.5, the string is \"0.5\", first_char '0', input_num 1.\n\nIf the sum is 123.45 \u2192 first_char '1', input_num 2.\n\nIf the sum is 1e-10 \u2192 the string would be \"1e-10\", first_char '1', input_num 2.\n\nSo in all cases where the first character is a digit, it's okay. If the first character is '.' (like if the sum is 0.0, but formatted as \"0\"), then no. Wait, \"0\" starts with '0'.\n\nSo the only case where first_char is not a digit is if the sum is in scientific notation with an exponent starting with 'e', but the first character would be the first digit before the exponent. For example, \"1e-10\" starts with '1'.\n\nThus, the first character is always a digit (0-9), so input_num will be a valid digit (0-9) +1, but if first_char is '9', then input_num is 10, which is two digits. Wait, but the third program reads the input as a long. For example, if the second program outputs '9' +1 \u2192 ':', which is ASCII 58. The third program would read that as a string, which is not a number, so it would fail. But according to the problem's original code, the third program would read that as a long, which would throw an error. But the problem requires the C program to behave identically, so we must handle that.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem's test cases ensure that the first character is a digit between 0-8, so that adding 1 gives a digit between 1-9. Or maybe the first character can be '9', leading to input_num 10, which is two digits. But the third program would read that as a long (10), which is valid.\n\nWait, the third program's input is the character (first_char +1). For example, if first_char is '9', then the second program outputs ':', which is not a digit. So the third program would read that as a string, which is not a number, so it would throw an error. But the problem requires the C program to behave the same as the original Java sequence. So in such a case, the third program would crash, and the C program must do the same.\n\nBut in the C program, we can't have the third step's input be a non-digit. So perhaps the problem's test cases ensure that the first character is a digit between 0-9, so that adding 1 gives a valid digit (0-9 or 10?).\n\nWait, adding 1 to '9' gives ':', which is not a digit. So in that case, the third program would fail to parse the input. But the original Java sequence would also fail. So the C program must handle that.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, we must pass the character (first_char +1) as the input to the third step, even if it's not a digit. The third step's code will then read it as a long, which would fail if it's not a number. But in C, the third step's code must read the input as a long, so we need to read the input as a string and parse it.\n\nWait, in the third step's code in C, the input is the character (first_char +1). So the third step's input is a single character, which is passed as a string. So in C, the third step's input is the character (first_char +1), which is stored in a variable like char c2 = first_char +1; then the input_num is (c2 - '0') if it's a digit, but if not, then it's invalid.\n\nBut in the C program, the third step's code must read the input as a long. So in the C program, the third step's input is the character c2, which is passed as a string. So in code:\n\nchar c2 = first_char + 1;\n\nchar input_str[2] = {c2, '\\0'};\n\nlong input_num = strtol(input_str, NULL, 10);\n\nBut if c2 is not a digit, then strtol returns 0 and sets errno. But the original Java code would have the third program read the input as a long, which would throw an error. So the C program must also handle that.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the C program must behave identically. So if the input is invalid, the third program would crash, and the C program must do the same. But in C, we can't have the program crash unless we handle it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases ensure that the input is valid.\n\nAssuming that the first character is a digit between 0-9, so that c2 is between '0'+'1' (up to '9'+'1' = ':'), but only digits are allowed. Wait, no. For example, if first_char is '9', then c2 is ':', which is not a digit. So the third program would fail.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's test cases don't have such cases. For example, the first program's output is such that the first character is a digit between 0-8, so adding 1 gives a valid digit between 1-9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is such that the first character is a digit between 0-9, and the third program can handle the input even if it's two digits (like '10'). But in that case, the third program's input is the character ':', which is not a digit, so it would fail.\n\nThis is a problem. To handle this correctly, perhaps the C program must pass the character as a string and let the third step's code parse it as a long. So in code:\n\nchar c2 = first_char + 1;\n\nchar input_str[2] ="
