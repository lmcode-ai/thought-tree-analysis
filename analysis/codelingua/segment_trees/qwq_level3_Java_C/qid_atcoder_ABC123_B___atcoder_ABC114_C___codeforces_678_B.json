The other elements (indices 1-4):\n\n23 \u2192 mod10 is 3 \u2192 add 23 +7 =30. 34 \u2192 mod4 \u2192 add 34+6=40.\n\n45 \u2192 mod5 \u2192 add 45+5=50.\n\n56 \u2192 mod6 \u2192 add 56+4=60. The last element (12) is added as is. Total ans = 12 +30+40+50+60 = 12+180 = 192. Yes. Now, the second part's function. Suppose N is 357 \u2192 the first i is 357. It contains 3,5,7 \u2192 c increments to 1. Then next i is 373. 373 is larger than 357 \u2192 loop ends. So c is 1. Another test case: N=375. The loop runs for i=357 (counted), 373 (counted?), 375. Check if 373 contains all three digits: 3,7,3 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 no. So c increments only for 357 and 375? Wait, 375 has digits 3,7,5 \u2192 yes. So when i=375, it is counted. So total c would be 2 (357 and 375). The code's loop would process i=357 (counted), then next i is 373 (not counted), then next i is 375 (counted). Thus, c would be 2. Third part's test case:\n\nSuppose y=2016 (leap year).",

Wait, after processing the reversed string (s), the new_s is the modified reversed string. To get the next i, we need to reverse new_s again to get the original order. Wait, in the code above, after processing, the new_s is the modified reversed string. Then, the code reverses new_s again (the for loop with k from 0 to new_len/2).",

So, in the code:\n\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n... bool check_leap(int y) {\n\n    return (y%400 ==0) || (y%4 ==0 && y%100 ! =0);\n\n}\n\nbool contains357(long num) { ... }\n\nNow, putting all together.",

So yes, that's correct. Wait, but in the first case, if b is greater than current max_b, then we update. If equal, then also update, so that the last a[i] with that b is stored. Yes, that's correct. Once we have max_b and last_a, then we need to find the index of last_a in the array a. Because in the Java code, they loop through the array to find the index where a[i] == last_a.

Find the last index where a[i] == last_a \u2192 idx.\n\nCompute ans:\n\nans = 0\n\nfor each i from 0 to4:\n\n    if i != idx:\n\n        if (a[i]%10 ==0):\n\n            ans += a[i]\n\n        else:\n\n            ans += a[i] + (10 - (a[i]%10))\n\n    else:\n\n        ans += a[i]\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop for non-idx adds the adjusted value, and then adds last (the a[idx] as is). So the code in Java is:\n\nfor (i != idx) \u2192 add the adjusted value (either a[i] or a[i] + (10 - r[i]))\n\nthen ans += last \u2192 which is a[idx]. Wait, but in the code, the loop for non-idx elements:\n\nif (a[i]%10 ==0 \u2192 add a[i], else add a[i] + (10 - r[i]). So that's the same as adding a[i] rounded up to the next 10.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that works the same way. The key points are that the first program reads input, the last outputs, and the middle ones process without I/O. Let me start by understanding each Java file's functionality.\n\nFirst, looking at File 1 (atcoder_ABC123_B). It reads 5 integers, calculates their remainder mod 10, and uses a TreeMap to track the next multiples of 10. The logic seems to be calculating the sum of the numbers, but adjusting some to round up to the next 10 except for the last one. The TreeMap is ordered, so the last key is the largest needed adjustment. The final answer is the sum with adjustments except for the last element which is added as is.\n\nThen File 2 (atcoder_ABC114_C) reads N, then counts numbers up to N that contain 3,5,7. But there's a loop generating numbers in a specific way. Wait, the code uses a while loop starting at 357, and then builds the next number by some string manipulation. The loop increments by generating the next number by appending digits in a way that's a bit tricky. The count 'c' is incremented when the current number has all three digits. The way the next number is generated is by modifying the digits in reverse, which might be a way to generate numbers with 3,5,7 in some order? Not sure, but the C code needs to replicate that logic.\n\nThird File (codeforces_678_B) takes a year and finds the next year where the total days since the input year modulo 7 is 0, and the leap year status matches the original. The check_leap function is straightforward.\n\nNow, the challenge is to chain these three programs into a single C program. The first program's input is read via stdin, then its output is passed to the second, which processes it and passes to the third, which finally outputs. But in C, we can't have intermediate I/O, so all data must be passed via variables.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But in the original setup, each Java program reads from stdin and writes to stdout. So the first program's input is the user's input, then its output is piped to the second, which reads that as input, and so on. The final output is the third's output.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, the first part (equivalent to File1) must read the input, process it, and store the result in a variable. Then the second part (File2) takes that result as input, processes it, and stores another variable. The third part (File3) takes that variable and outputs the final result.\n\nWait, but how do the outputs of each Java program connect? Let me see each program's input and output.\n\nLooking at each Java program's input and output:\n\nFile1 (ABC123_B):\n\nInput: 5 integers from stdin.\n\nOutput: a single integer (the calculated ans).\n\nSo the first program's output is an integer, which is the input to the second program?\n\nWait, the second Java program (ABC114_C) starts with reading N via gi(). So the input to the second program is N, which is the output of the first program. Wait, but the first program's output is a single integer (the ans). So the second program's input is that integer. Then the second program's output is the count 'c', which is then the input to the third program?\n\nWait, the third program (codeforces_678_B) starts by reading a year y from stdin. So the third program's input is the output of the second program, which is the count 'c' from the second program. So the second program's output is an integer (the count c), which is the input to the third program as the year y?\n\nWait, but the third program's input is a year, which is an integer. So the second program's output must be that integer. So the chain is:\n\nUser input (for first program) \u2192 first program's output (integer) \u2192 second program's input (N) \u2192 second program's output (c) \u2192 third program's input (y) \u2192 third program's output (the desired year).\n\nTherefore, in the C program, the first part must read the 5 integers, compute the ans (the first program's output), then pass that ans as the input N to the second part (second program's logic), which computes c, then pass that c as the input y to the third part (third program's logic), which computes the final output.\n\nTherefore, the C program structure will be:\n\n- Read the 5 integers from stdin (first part's input).\n\n- Compute the first program's ans (output of first program).\n\n- Use that ans as the input N for the second part (second program's logic), compute c (output of second program).\n\n- Use that c as the input y for the third part (third program's logic), compute the final output (the desired year), and print it.\n\nSo the C program will have three main sections, each corresponding to the Java files, but connected via variables.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nFirst part (File1):\n\nThe first program reads 5 integers a[0] to a[4]. Then calculates r[i] = a[i] %10. Then for each a[i], if r[i] !=0, then b = 10 - r[i], and adds to a TreeMap with key b and value a[i]. The TreeMap is sorted, so the last key is the largest b. The last element in the TreeMap is the one with the largest b. Then, the last element's value is the 'last' variable. The index of 'last' in the a array is found. Then, the sum is computed by adding all a[i] except the last one, but adjusted to the next 10 (if mod10 !=0, add 10 - r[i]). The last element is added as is.\n\nWait, let me re-express the logic in C terms.\n\nIn C, the TreeMap can be replaced by an array of structs, sorted by the key. Since TreeMap is sorted in natural order, which for integers is ascending. So the keys (b values) are stored in order. The last key is the maximum. So in C, perhaps we can collect all the (b, a[i]) pairs where r[i] !=0, sort them by b in ascending order, then the last element is the one with the largest b. Alternatively, track the maximum b and its corresponding a[i].\n\nAlternatively, since we need the maximum b, perhaps we can track the maximum b and the corresponding a[i] directly without a TreeMap.\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nmax_b = -1\n\nlast_a = 0\n\nfor each a[i]:\n\nr = a[i] %10\n\nif r !=0:\n\n    b = 10 - r\n\n    if b > max_b:\n\n        max_b = b\n\n        last_a = a[i]\n\n    else if b == max_b:\n\n        // need to check which a[i] is the one with the same b? Or does the TreeMap's lastKey() pick the largest a[i]?\n\nWait, the TreeMap in Java stores keys in sorted order. The lastKey() gives the largest key. The value stored is the a[i] for that key. But if multiple entries have the same key (same b), then the TreeMap would have only one entry for that key, since keys are unique. Wait, in the code, for each a[i], if r[i] !=0, then it adds b as the key and a[i] as the value. But if two a's have the same b, then the later one would overwrite the previous entry. Because TreeMap's put replaces the value for the same key.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for each a[i], if r[i] !=0, then it does map.put(b, a[i]). So if two a's have the same b, the later a[i] will overwrite the previous entry. So the TreeMap's lastKey() will have the maximum b, and the value is the last a[i] that had that b.\n\nTherefore, in C, to track the maximum b and the corresponding a[i], we can track the maximum b and the a[i] that caused it. However, if there are multiple a's with the same b, the last one (in the loop order) would be the one stored. So in C, we can track the maximum b and the corresponding a[i], updating whenever a higher b is found, or same b but later a[i].\n\nAlternatively, since the loop is from i=0 to 4, the last a[i] with the maximum b is the one that would be stored in the TreeMap. So in C, we can track the maximum b and the a[i] that has that b, but if there are multiple, the last one in the array (i from 0 to 4) would be the one.\n\nWait, the code in Java loops from 0 to 4 (since a.length is 5). So for each a[i], when adding to the TreeMap, if the same b is encountered again, the later a[i] will overwrite the previous entry. So the TreeMap's entry for that b will have the latest a[i].\n\nTherefore, the last a[i] with the maximum b is the one stored in the TreeMap's last entry.\n\nTherefore, in C, to track this, we can:\n\nInitialize max_b to -1, and last_a to 0.\n\nFor each i from 0 to 4:\n\n    r = a[i] %10\n\n    if r !=0:\n\n        b = 10 - r\n\n        if (b > max_b) or (b == max_b and a[i] is later than previous a with same b):\n\n            then update max_b and last_a.\n\nWait, but how to track the latest a[i] for the same b?\n\nAlternatively, for each a[i], if the current b is greater than max_b, then update max_b and last_a to current a[i].\n\nIf the current b is equal to max_b, then since this a[i] is later in the loop, we should update last_a to this a[i].\n\nSo:\n\nfor each i in 0..4:\n\n    r = a[i]%10\n\n    if r !=0:\n\n        b = 10 - r\n\n        if (b > max_b) || (b == max_b && (current a[i] is later than previous one?)):\n\n            max_b = b\n\n            last_a = a[i]\n\nWait, but since the loop is in order, the later a[i] will overwrite the previous if same b. So whenever b is equal to current max_b, we can just update last_a to the current a[i], because it's the latest one.\n\nSo the logic is:\n\nInitialize max_b = -1, last_a = 0.\n\nfor (i from 0 to 4):\n\n    r = a[i] %10\n\n    if r !=0:\n\n        b = 10 - r\n\n        if (b > max_b) || (b == max_b):\n\n            max_b = b\n\n            last_a = a[i]\n\nWait, but that would overwrite even if the b is same but the a[i] is later. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the first case, if b is greater than current max_b, then we update. If equal, then also update, so that the last a[i] with that b is stored.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nOnce we have max_b and last_a, then we need to find the index of last_a in the array a. Because in the Java code, they loop through the array to find the index where a[i] == last_a. But there could be duplicates. However, since the TreeMap's last entry's value is the last a[i] with that b, so the index is the last occurrence of that a[i] in the array.\n\nWait, but in the code, the last_a is the a[i] that was the last one with the maximum b. So the index is the last occurrence of that a[i] in the array. But if there are multiple a[i] with the same value, but different b's, then it's possible that the last_a is not the last occurrence of its value. Hmm, but in the code, the last_a is the a[i] that was the last to have the maximum b. So the index is the position of that a[i].\n\nTherefore, in C, after finding last_a, we need to loop through the array to find its index (the first occurrence? Or the last occurrence? Wait, in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <5; i++) {\n\n    if (a[i] == last) {\n\n        idx =i;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo this sets idx to the last occurrence of last_a in the array. Because it loops from 0 to 4, and each time a[i] matches, it updates idx. So the final idx is the last index where a[i] equals last_a.\n\nTherefore, in C, we need to loop through the array and track the last index where a[i] == last_a.\n\nOnce we have that index, the sum is computed as follows:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nFor each i from 0 to4:\n\n    if i != idx:\n\n        if a[i] mod10 is 0:\n\n            add a[i] to ans\n\n        else:\n\n            add a[i] + (10 - r[i]) to ans\n\n    else:\n\n        add a[i] to ans (but only at the end, since the loop is over all except idx, then add last_a at the end?)\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nThe code does:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <5; i++) {\n\n    if (i != idx) {\n\n        ... add to ans\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nthen ans += last;\n\nWait, the last is the last_a, which is a[i] at index idx. So the loop adds all except the idx, then adds last (the a[idx] as is).\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor (i != idx) \u2192 add the adjusted value (either a[i] or a[i] + (10 - r[i]))\n\nthen ans += last \u2192 which is a[idx].\n\nWait, but the code in Java's loop for the non-idx elements:\n\nif a[i] mod10 is 0 \u2192 add a[i], else add a[i] + (10 - r[i]). Because r[i] is a[i]%10, so 10 - r[i] is the amount to round up to next 10. So for numbers ending with 0, they are already multiples of 10, so no addition needed. For others, add the difference to reach next 10.\n\nWait, but the code uses r[i], which is a[i]%10. So for a[i] = 23 \u2192 r is 3 \u2192 10-3=7 \u2192 adding 7 gives 30. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the total ans is sum of all except the last element (the one at idx) rounded up to next 10, plus the last element as is.\n\nWait, but the last element (the one at idx) is the one with the maximum b. So the code is adding it as is, not rounded up. Because the TreeMap's last entry's a[i] is the one with the maximum b (the one needing the most rounding?), but the code adds it as is. So the logic is that the last element is not rounded up, but kept as original. The others are rounded up to the next 10 (if needed).\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\nRead 5 integers into an array a[5].\n\nCompute r[i] = a[i]%10 for each.\n\nTrack max_b and last_a as above.\n\nFind the last index where a[i] == last_a \u2192 idx.\n\nCompute ans:\n\nans = 0\n\nfor each i from 0 to4:\n\n    if i != idx:\n\n        if (a[i]%10 ==0):\n\n            ans += a[i]\n\n        else:\n\n            ans += a[i] + (10 - (a[i]%10))\n\n    else:\n\n        ans += a[i]\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop for non-idx adds the adjusted value, and then adds last (the a[idx] as is). So the code in Java is:\n\nfor (i != idx) \u2192 add the adjusted value (either a[i] or a[i] + (10 - r[i]))\n\nthen ans += last \u2192 which is a[idx].\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop for non-idx elements:\n\nif (a[i]%10 ==0 \u2192 add a[i], else add a[i] + (10 - r[i]). So that's the same as adding a[i] rounded up to the next 10.\n\nThen, the last element (a[idx]) is added as is. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, in C, the code for the first part is manageable.\n\nNow, moving to the second Java program (ABC114_C):\n\nThe second program reads N (from the first program's output, which is the ans from first part). Then counts numbers up to N that contain 3,5,7. But the code's loop is a bit more complex.\n\nWait, the code starts with i=357, and loops while i <= N. For each i, it checks if the string contains 3,5,7. If yes, increment c. Then, it generates the next i by some string manipulation.\n\nThe way the next i is generated is:\n\nTake the string of i, reverse it, and process each digit. The code uses a StringBuilder to build the next number.\n\nThe code's logic for generating the next i is:\n\nThe code builds a new number by processing each digit from the end (since it's reversed). The first digit (the last digit of the original number) is modified as follows:\n\n- If the first character (after reversing) is '3', replace with '5' and set a flag f to true.\n\n- If it's '5', replace with '7' and set f to true.\n\n- Else (must be '7' or other?), then append '3' and set f to false?\n\nWait, the code's loop over the digits:\n\nThe code loops over the reversed string (since s.length() -1 -j is the original digits in reverse order). The first character (the last digit of the original number) is processed first.\n\nThe code uses a flag 'f' which is initially false. For each character in the reversed string (so processing from the end of the original number):\n\nIf f is false:\n\n- If the current character is '3', replace with '5', set f to true.\n\n- Else if '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n- Else (like '7' or other?), then append '3' (but wait, the code says:\n\nelse {\n\n    sb.append('3');\n\n}\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (a == '3') \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nelse if (a == '5') \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nelse \u2192 append '3'.\n\nWait, so for any other character (like '7' or '0', etc.), it appends '3'?\n\nHmm, that's a bit odd. Then, after processing all characters, if f is false, append a '3' to the end.\n\nWait, the code's logic is a bit tricky. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe code is building the next number as follows:\n\nTake the current number's string, reverse it, then process each character (starting from the first character of the reversed string, which is the last digit of the original number).\n\nThe goal is to generate the next number in some sequence. The code's approach is to increment the number in a way that cycles through 3\u21925\u21927\u21923?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is generating numbers in a way that each digit is increased in the sequence 3\u21925\u21927\u21923, but only when possible. The way the next number is generated is by incrementing the rightmost digit that can be increased in this sequence, and appending 3 if all digits are 7.\n\nAlternatively, the code is generating numbers in a way similar to counting in base 3, but with digits 3,5,7. The next number is generated by incrementing the last possible digit, and carrying over if needed.\n\nThe code's approach is to process the reversed digits (so starting from the least significant digit), and for each digit:\n\n- If it's 3, change to 5, set flag f to true (meaning we've made a change, so no further changes needed).\n\n- If it's 5, change to 7, set f to true.\n\n- If it's 7, then we can't increment further, so leave it as is, but since f is still false, we continue to the next digit.\n\n- If it's any other digit (like 0,1, etc.), then replace with 3, set f to true.\n\nOnce all digits are processed, if f is still false (meaning all digits were 7?), then append a '3' to the end (so the next number would be 377...73? Not sure).\n\nThis is a bit complex. The key is that the next number is generated in a way that the digits are only 3,5,7, and the sequence is ordered such that each step increments the number in a specific way.\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\ni starts at 357, and increments by generating the next number as per the string manipulation. The loop continues while i <= N.\n\nThe count 'c' is incremented whenever the current i contains all three digits 3,5,7.\n\nThe problem is to translate this into C, but without I/O except for the first and last steps.\n\nThe second part's input is N (the first program's output), and its output is c (the count).\n\nSo in C, the second part must take N as an input (from first part's ans), compute c, and pass it to the third part.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the loop that generates the next i correctly.\n\nLet me think of how to implement the next number generation in C.\n\nThe steps for generating the next number from current i:\n\n1. Convert i to a string (as a char array).\n\n2. Reverse the string.\n\n3. Process each character (starting from the first character of the reversed string, which is the last digit of the original number).\n\n4. Build a new string based on the rules.\n\n5. Convert the new string back to a long i.\n\nBut in C, handling strings and characters can be done with arrays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the digits without converting to a string, but that might be more complex.\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nSuppose current i is 357 \u2192 string is \"357\".\n\nReversed is \"753\".\n\nProcessing each character (digits '7', '5', '3'):\n\nStart with f = false.\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nSince f is false, check the character:\n\nIt's '7', so append '3' (since it's not 3 or 5). So the first character in the new string is '3', and f remains false.\n\nSecond character (5):\n\nNow, f is still false. The character is '5', so replace with '7', set f to true. So append '7'.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is now true, so append the original character (3) as is.\n\nSo the new string after processing is \"373\".\n\nThen, since f was set to true, we don't append anything else. The reversed string is \"373\", so the original number is 373.\n\nWait, but the reversed string after processing is \"373\", so the original number is 373? Wait, the processing builds the new string as follows:\n\nThe code's sb is built by processing the reversed string (original digits in reverse order). The code's sb is built by appending characters as per the rules, then the final string is reversed again to get the next i.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the code:\n\nThe code's code for generating the next i:\n\nAfter processing the reversed string (the original digits in reverse order), the code does:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); \u2192 sb is the modified string.\n\nThen, i = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nAh, right! So the sb is the modified reversed string, then reversed again to get the next number.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nOriginal number is i \u2192 string s = \"357\".\n\nReversed s is \"753\".\n\nProcessing the reversed s (each character in '7', '5', '3'):\n\nThe code builds the sb as follows:\n\nInitially, sb is empty.\n\nProcessing first character (7):\n\nf is false \u2192 since it's not 3 or 5, append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character (5):\n\nf is still false \u2192 since it's 5, replace with '7', append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is now true \u2192 append the original character (3).\n\nSo the sb after processing is \"3\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, the code appends nothing else (since f was set to true).\n\nThen, the code creates sb2 as a copy of sb, then reverses it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the next i would be 373, which is the next number after 357.\n\nWait, but the next number after 357 would be 357 + 16 = 373? Not sure, but the code's logic is generating numbers in a specific way.\n\nAnother example: Let's take i = 357 \u2192 next is 373.\n\nThen, next step:\n\ni is 373 \u2192 string is \"373\".\n\nReversed is \"373\".\n\nProcessing each character (3,7,3):\n\nFirst character (3):\n\nf is false \u2192 replace with '5', set f to true. So append '5'.\n\nSecond character (7):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"573\".\n\nReversing gives \"375\" \u2192 next i is 375.\n\nWait, no, the sb after processing is \"573\", then reversed gives \"375\".\n\nWait, the sb is \"5\" (from first character 3\u21925), then '7' (second character 7 is processed with f true, so append as is?), then third character 3 is processed with f true, so append as is \u2192 so the sb is \"573\".\n\nReversing gives \"375\", so next i is 375.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nThe code's logic is generating numbers in a way that cycles through 3\u21925\u21927\u21923 for each digit, but only when possible, and appending 3 when all digits are 7.\n\nThis is a bit complex, but in C, we can implement this by converting the number to a string, processing it as per the rules, then converting back.\n\nIn C, steps for the second part:\n\nInput N is the first program's output (ans).\n\nInitialize c =0.\n\nInitialize i = 357.\n\nLoop while i <= N:\n\n    Check if the current i contains all three digits 3,5,7 \u2192 if yes, increment c.\n\n    Then generate the next i.\n\nTo generate next i:\n\n1. Convert i to a string (char array).\n\n2. Reverse the string.\n\n3. Process each character in the reversed string (so starting from the end of the original number).\n\n4. Build the new string as per the rules.\n\n5. Reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nImplementing this in C requires string manipulation functions.\n\nFirst, the function to check if a number contains all three digits:\n\nWe can write a helper function that takes a number and returns true if it has at least one 3, one 5, and one 7.\n\nThen, the next number generation:\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, the loop:\n\nlong i = 357;\n\nint c =0;\n\nwhile (i <= N) {\n\n    if (contains357(i)) c++;\n\n    // generate next i\n\n    char s[20]; // enough for up to 1e9 (assuming N is up to 1e9?)\n\n    sprintf(s, \"%ld\", i);\n\n    int len = strlen(s);\n\n    // reverse the string\n\n    for (int i=0; i < len/2; i++) {\n\n        char temp = s[i];\n\n        s[i] = s[len-1 -i];\n\n        s[len-1 -i] = temp;\n\n    }\n\n    // process each character in the reversed string (now s is reversed)\n\n    char new_s[20];\n\n    int new_len =0;\n\n    bool f = false;\n\n    for (int j=0; j < len; j++) {\n\n        char c = s[j];\n\n        if (!f) {\n\n            if (c == '3') {\n\n                new_s[new_len++] = '5';\n\n                f = true;\n\n            } else if (c == '5') {\n\n                new_s[new_len++] = '7';\n\n                f = true;\n\n            } else {\n\n                new_s[new_len++] = '3';\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            new_s[new_len++] = c;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // after processing, if f is still false, append '3'\n\n    if (!f) {\n\n        new_s[new_len++] = '3';\n\n    }\n\n    // now, reverse the new_s to get the next number\n\n    for (int i=0; i < new_len/2; i++) {\n\n        char temp = new_s[i];\n\n        new_s[i] = new_s[new_len-1 -i];\n\n        new_s[new_len-1 -i] = temp;\n\n    }\n\n    // convert back to long\n\n    i = atol(new_s);\n\n}\n\nWait, but there are some issues here.\n\nWait, the reversed string is s (after reversing the original string). Then processing each character in s (the reversed string) to build new_s.\n\nWait, the code in Java's processing is:\n\nThe reversed string is s (original digits reversed). The code processes each character in s (from first to last), building the new_s as per the rules.\n\nWait, in the code's processing loop:\n\nfor (int j=0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n\n    char a = s.charAt(j); // which is the reversed string's j-th character (original's last digit first)\n\n    if (!f) {\n\n        if (a == '3') \u2192 replace with '5', set f to true.\n\n        else if (a == '5') \u2192 replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n        else \u2192 append '3' (regardless of what it is?)\n\n    } else {\n\n        append a as is.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, in the else part (when f is false and the current character is not 3 or 5), then we append '3', and f remains false?\n\nWait, in the code's else clause (when a is not 3 or 5):\n\n    sb.append('3');\n\n    // f is not set to true here.\n\nSo after that, f remains false.\n\nSo in the example where the first character is '7', we append '3', and f remains false.\n\nThen, moving to the next character (the second character in the reversed string, which is the second last digit of the original number).\n\nSo in the example of 357 \u2192 reversed is \"753\".\n\nProcessing first character '7' (j=0):\n\nf is false \u2192 since it's not 3 or 5, append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character '5' (j=1):\n\nf is still false \u2192 replace with '7', set f to true.\n\nThird character '3' (j=2):\n\nf is now true \u2192 append '3' as is.\n\nSo new_s is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second step) + \"3\" (third step) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, since f was set to true, we don't append anything else.\n\nThen, the new_s is \"373\", which is the reversed string (since we reversed the original, then processed, then the new_s is the modified reversed string. Then, to get the next i, we reverse new_s again.\n\nWait, in the code, after building the new_s (the modified reversed string), the code does:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); \u2192 which is the new_s.\n\nThen, i = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nSo the new_s is reversed again to get the next i.\n\nWait, in the example, new_s is \"373\", reversing it gives \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but in the code's processing, the new_s is the modified reversed string. To get the next number, you reverse it again to get the original order.\n\nSo in code:\n\nnext_i = reverse(new_s).\n\nTherefore, in C, after building new_s (the modified reversed string), we need to reverse it again to get the next number.\n\nWait, in the code above, I had:\n\nAfter processing, the new_s is the modified reversed string. Then, to get the next number, we reverse new_s again.\n\nWait, in the code's example, the new_s after processing is \"373\", reversing it gives \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nAnother example: Let's take i = 373 \u2192 original string is \"373\".\n\nReversed is \"373\".\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nFirst character '3' (j=0):\n\nf is false \u2192 replace with '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond character '7' (j=1):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nThird character '3' (j=2):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo new_s is \"573\".\n\nReversing gives \"375\" \u2192 next i is 375.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\nAfter processing the reversed string (s), the new_s is built as per the rules, then reversed again to get the next i.\n\nTherefore, in the code:\n\nAfter building new_s (the modified reversed string), we need to reverse it again to get the next i.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, I reversed the new_s again. Wait, no, in the code I had:\n\nAfter building new_s (the modified reversed string), I reversed it again (the for loop for reversing new_s). Wait, no, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nThe new_s (after processing) is the modified reversed string. Then, the code reverses it again to get the next number.\n\nSo in C:\n\nAfter building new_s (the modified reversed string), we need to reverse it to get the next number's string.\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nsb2 is the StringBuffer of the new_s (the modified reversed string). Then, sb2.reverse() is called, which reverses it again, so the final string is the original order.\n\nTherefore, in C:\n\nThe new_s is the modified reversed string. To get the next number, we need to reverse new_s again.\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nOriginal string is \"357\".\n\nReversed is \"753\".\n\nAfter processing, new_s is \"373\".\n\nReversing new_s gives \"373\" \u2192 which is the next number.\n\nWait, the next number is the reversed of the new_s.\n\nWait, the new_s is the modified reversed string. To get the next number, you reverse it again.\n\nSo the next number's string is the reverse of new_s.\n\nTherefore, in C:\n\nAfter building new_s (the modified reversed string), we need to reverse it to get the next number's string.\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote earlier, I reversed new_s again. Let me see:\n\nIn the code I wrote:\n\nAfter building new_s (the modified reversed string), I did:\n\n// reverse the new_s to get the next number\n\nfor (int i=0; i < new_len/2; i++) {\n\n    swap new_s[i] and new_s[new_len-1 -i]\n\n}\n\nThen, the next i is atol(new_s).\n\nWait, but that would be the reversed of new_s, which is the correct next number.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code for generating the next i is as follows.\n\nNow, the contains357 function:\n\nbool contains357(long num) {\n\n    int has3 =0, has5=0, has7=0;\n\n    while (num >0) {\n\n        int d = num%10;\n\n        if (d ==3) has3=1;\n\n        else if (d ==5) has5=1;\n\n        else if (d ==7) has7=1;\n\n        num /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    return has3 && has5 && has7;\n\n}\n\nWait, but this would miss leading zeros? No, since numbers don't have leading zeros. So this should work.\n\nNow, the third program (codeforces_678_B):\n\nThe third program takes a year y (the output of the second program, which is c), and finds the next year where the total days since y is a multiple of 7, and the leap year status matches the original.\n\nThe original code:\n\nThe code starts with y = input (from second program's output c).\n\nThen, it checks if the current year is a leap year (leap = check_leap(y)).\n\nThen, it loops over i starting from y+1, accumulating the days (sum += 365 or 366 based on leap year of i-1?), and when sum mod7 is 0, checks if the leap status of i matches the original leap status of y. If so, print and return.\n\nWait, let me re-express the code:\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nint y = in.nextInt();\n\nboolean leap = check_leap(y);\n\nint sum =0;\n\nfor (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n\n    if (check_leap(i)) sum +=366 else 365.\n\n    if (sum %7 ==0) {\n\n        if ( (check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap) ) \u2192 same leap status?\n\n        then print and return.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the condition is whether the leap status of the current i (the year being considered) matches the original leap status of y?\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif ( (check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap) )\n\nWhich is equivalent to (check_leap(i) == leap).\n\nSo the condition is that the current year i has the same leap status as the original year y.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nThe problem statement for codeforces_678_B is to find the next year after y where the number of days from y to that year is a multiple of 7, and the leap year status of that year is the same as y's.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nWe need to find the smallest year X > Y such that:\n\n1. The total number of days between Y and X (exclusive) is divisible by 7.\n\n2. The leap year status of X is the same as Y's.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nsum is the total days from Y+1 up to X (since i starts at Y+1 and increments, and sum is added for each i's days (365 or 366). So when i reaches X, the sum is the total days from Y+1 to X, which is the days between Y and X (since Y to Y+1 is one day, but the sum starts at Y+1's days).\n\nWait, perhaps the code is accumulating the days from Y+1 to i, and when the sum mod7 is 0, then the total days from Y to i is sum +1 (since Y's own days are not counted?), but I'm not sure. The problem's exact condition needs to be considered.\n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the total days between Y and X (exclusive) is divisible by 7. So the days from Y to X is (X - Y) years' worth of days, but not including X's own days?\n\nWait, the code's sum is the total days from Y+1 up to i (the current i). So when the loop is at i = X, the sum is the days from Y+1 to X, which is exactly the days between Y and X (since Y to Y+1 is one day, but the sum counts the full years from Y+1 to X).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the total days between Y and X (exclusive) is divisible by 7. So the days between Y and X is (X - Y) years' days, but not including X's own days. So the sum is the total days from Y+1 to X-1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is that the sum is the total days from Y+1 up to and including i (the current i). So when the sum mod7 is 0, then the total days from Y to i is sum + (days in Y) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look at the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nYou are given a year y. Find the smallest year x > y such that:\n\n- The number of days between y and x is a multiple of 7.\n\n- The leap year status of x is the same as that of y.\n\nWait, the days between y and x: the total days from y to x-1 inclusive?\n\nAssuming that the days between y and x is the total days from y to x-1.\n\nThe code's approach is:\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nFor each i starting at y+1:\n\nsum += days of i (365 or 366).\n\nWhen sum mod7 ==0, then the total days from y to i is sum (since the days from y to i-1 would be sum - days of i? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code is considering the total days from y+1 to i (the current i) as sum. So when the sum mod7 is 0, then the total days from y to i is (sum + days of y) ?\n\nNot sure, but the code's logic is that when sum mod7 is 0, then the total days between y and i is sum (since the days from y+1 to i is sum, and the days between y and i would be sum plus 1 (the day of y itself?), but perhaps the problem counts the days between y and x as the days from y+1 to x-1.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's first condition is that the total days between y and x is divisible by 7. The code's condition is that the sum (days from y+1 to x) is divisible by 7. So perhaps the problem counts the days between y and x as the days from y+1 to x, which would be the same as the sum.\n\nIn any case, the code's logic is:\n\nLoop over x starting from y+1:\n\nsum += days of x (365 or 366).\n\nIf sum mod7 ==0, then check if x has the same leap status as y. If yes, return x.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct.\n\nTherefore, in C, the third part must take the input y (which is the second program's output c), and compute the next x as per the code.\n\nThe check_leap function is straightforward:\n\nbool check_leap(int y) {\n\n    return (y %400 ==0) || (y%4 ==0 && y%100 !=0);\n\n}\n\nThe loop:\n\nint y = input (from second part's output c).\n\nbool leap = check_leap(y);\n\nint sum =0;\n\nfor (int x = y+1; ; x++) {\n\n    int days = check_leap(x) ? 366 : 365;\n\n    sum += days;\n\n    if (sum %7 ==0) {\n\n        if (check_leap(x) == leap) {\n\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n\n            return 0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, the loop is infinite until it finds the correct x. So in C, the loop must continue until it finds the x.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe C program will have:\n\n- Read the 5 integers from stdin.\n\n- Compute the first part's ans (the output of first program).\n\n- Use that ans as N for the second part.\n\n- Compute the second part's c (output of second program).\n\n- Use that c as y for the third part.\n\n- Compute the third part's x and print it.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <string.h>\n\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n// Function declarations\n\nint compute_first_part(int a[5]);\n\nint compute_second_part(int N);\n\nint compute_third_part(int y);\n\nint main() {\n\n    int a[5];\n\n    for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    int first_output = compute_first_part(a);\n\n    int second_output = compute_second_part(first_output);\n\n    int third_output = compute_third_part(second_output);\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", third_output);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\n// Implement each function.\n\nFirst, compute_first_part:\n\nint compute_first_part(int a[5]) {\n\n    int r[5];\n\n    int max_b = -1;\n\n    int last_a = 0;\n\n    int idx =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n\n        r[i] = a[i]%10;\n\n        if (r[i] !=0) {\n\n            int b = 10 - r[i];\n\n            if (b > max_b || (b == max_b)) {\n\n                max_b = b;\n\n                last_a = a[i];\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Find the index of last_a in a array, last occurrence.\n\n    idx = -1;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n\n        if (a[i] == last_a) {\n\n            idx =i;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    int ans =0;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n\n        if (i != idx) {\n\n            if (r[i] ==0) {\n\n                ans += a[i];\n\n            } else {\n\n                ans += a[i] + (10 - r[i]);\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            ans += a[i];\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loop for finding idx is correct. The last occurrence is stored.\n\nWait, in the code, the loop goes from 0 to4, and whenever a[i] == last_a, it updates idx. So the final idx is the last occurrence.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the second part function compute_second_part(int N):\n\nint compute_second_part(int N) {\n\n    int c =0;\n\n    long i =357;\n\n    while (i <= N) {\n\n        if (contains357(i)) c++;\n\n        // generate next i\n\n        char s[20];\n\n        sprintf(s, \"%ld\", i);\n\n        int len = strlen(s);\n\n        // reverse the string\n\n        for (int k=0; k < len/2; k++) {\n\n            char temp = s[k];\n\n            s[k] = s[len-1 -k];\n\n            s[len-1 -k] = temp;\n\n        }\n\n        // process each character in the reversed string (now s is reversed)\n\n        char new_s[20];\n\n        int new_len =0;\n\n        bool f = false;\n\n        for (int j=0; j < len; j++) {\n\n            char current = s[j];\n\n            if (!f) {\n\n                if (current == '3') {\n\n                    new_s[new_len++] = '5';\n\n                    f = true;\n\n                } else if (current == '5') {\n\n                    new_s[new_len++] = '7';\n\n                    f = true;\n\n                } else {\n\n                    new_s[new_len++] = '3';\n\n                }\n\n            } else {\n\n                new_s[new_len++] = current;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        // if f is still false, append '3'\n\n        if (!f) {\n\n            new_s[new_len++] = '3';\n\n        }\n\n        // reverse new_s to get the next i's string\n\n        for (int k=0; k < new_len/2; k++) {\n\n            char temp = new_s[k];\n\n            new_s[k] = new_s[new_len-1 -k];\n\n            new_s[new_len-1 -k] = temp;\n\n        }\n\n        // convert to long\n\n        i = atol(new_s);\n\n    }\n\n    return c;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the reversing steps need to be correct.\n\nWait, after processing the reversed string (s), the new_s is the modified reversed string. To get the next i, we need to reverse new_s again to get the original order.\n\nWait, in the code above, after processing, the new_s is the modified reversed string. Then, the code reverses new_s again (the for loop with k from 0 to new_len/2). This effectively reverses new_s, so the resulting new_s is the next number's string in original order.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the original s (after reversing) is \"753\".\n\nProcessing gives new_s as \"373\".\n\nThen, reversing new_s (373) gives \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: new_s after processing is \"573\" (from 373's processing).\n\nReversing new_s (573) gives \"375\", so next i is 375.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code for generating the next i is correct.\n\nNow, the contains357 function:\n\nbool contains357(long num) {\n\n    bool has3 = false, has5 = false, has7 = false;\n\n    while (num >0) {\n\n        int d = num%10;\n\n        if (d ==3) has3 = true;\n\n        else if (d ==5) has5 = true;\n\n        else if (d ==7) has7 = true;\n\n        num /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    return has3 && has5 && has7;\n\n}\n\nNow, the third part function compute_third_part(int y):\n\nint compute_third_part(int y) {\n\n    bool leap = (y%400 ==0) || (y%4 ==0 && y%100 !=0);\n\n    int sum =0;\n\n    for (int x = y+1; ; x++) {\n\n        int days = (check_leap(x) ? 366 : 365);\n\n        sum += days;\n\n        if (sum %7 ==0) {\n\n            if (check_leap(x) == leap) {\n\n                return x;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but check_leap is a helper function. Need to define it.\n\nWait, in C, the check_leap can be a function:\n\nbool check_leap(int y) {\n\n    return (y%400 ==0) || (y%4 ==0 && y%100 !=0);\n\n}\n\nBut in C, functions can't be inside other functions, so need to declare them.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n...\n\nbool check_leap(int y) {\n\n    return (y%400 ==0) || (y%4 ==0 && y%100 !=0);\n\n}\n\nbool contains357(long num) { ... }\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nWait, but in the compute_third_part function, the check_leap is called, so it must be declared before.\n\nNow, compiling all the pieces.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In the second part's function, the new_s array may have a length exceeding 20? Probably okay for the problem constraints.\n\n- The loop in the third part may take a long time for large y, but since it's a programming competition problem, it's manageable.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nFirst part's test case:\n\nSuppose the input is 5 numbers all divisible by 10. Then the TreeMap is empty, so the code adds all a[i] as is. So the first program's output is the sum of the 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: input 12, 23, 34, 45, 56.\n\nr[0] = 2 \u2192 b=8.\n\nr[1]=3 \u2192 b=7.\n\nr[2]=4 \u2192 b=6.\n\nr[3]=5 \u2192 b=5.\n\nr[4]=6 \u2192 b=4.\n\nThe max_b is 8 (from first element). last_a is 12.\n\nThe index is 0.\n\nThe sum is:\n\nFor elements 1,2,3,4:\n\neach is rounded up to next 10.\n\n12 \u2192 since it's the last element (index 0), added as is.\n\nWait, no: the elements except index 0 are added with their rounded values.\n\nWait, the first element (12) is the last_a (since it has the max b of 8). So the index is 0.\n\nThe other elements (indices 1-4):\n\n23 \u2192 mod10 is 3 \u2192 add 23 +7 =30.\n\n34 \u2192 mod4 \u2192 add 34+6=40.\n\n45 \u2192 mod5 \u2192 add 45+5=50.\n\n56 \u2192 mod6 \u2192 add 56+4=60.\n\nThe last element (12) is added as is.\n\nTotal ans = 12 +30+40+50+60 = 12+180 = 192.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the second part's function.\n\nSuppose N is 357 \u2192 the first i is 357. It contains 3,5,7 \u2192 c increments to 1. Then next i is 373. 373 is larger than 357 \u2192 loop ends. So c is 1.\n\nAnother test case: N=375.\n\nThe loop runs for i=357 (counted), 373 (counted?), 375.\n\nCheck if 373 contains all three digits: 3,7,3 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 no. So c increments only for 357 and 375?\n\nWait, 375 has digits 3,7,5 \u2192 yes. So when i=375, it is counted. So total c would be 2 (357 and 375).\n\nThe code's loop would process i=357 (counted), then next i is 373 (not counted), then next i is 375 (counted).\n\nThus, c would be 2.\n\nThird part's test case:\n\nSuppose y=2016 (leap year).\n\nWe need to find the next year after 2016 where the sum of days from 2017 to x is divisible by7, and x is a leap year.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStart with x=2017 (non-leap):\n\nsum +=365 \u2192 sum=365 mod7 \u2192 365/7=52*7=364 \u2192 1 \u2192 365 mod7 is 1.\n\nNot divisible.\n\nx=2018 \u2192 sum +=365 \u2192 total 730 mod7 \u2192 730/7=104*7=728 \u2192 2 \u2192 mod7 2.\n\nx=2019 \u2192 sum +=365 \u2192 1095 mod7 \u2192 1095-1092=3 \u2192 mod3.\n\nx=2020 (leap) \u2192 sum +=366 \u2192 total 1461 \u2192 1461 mod7: 1461/7=208*7=1456 \u2192 5 \u2192 mod5.\n\nx=2021 \u2192 sum +=365 \u2192 1461+365=1826 \u2192 mod7: 1826 mod7 \u2192 1826-1820=6 \u2192 mod6.\n\nx=2022 \u2192 +365 \u2192 1826+365=2191 \u2192 mod7: 2191 mod7 \u2192 2191-2184=7 \u2192 mod0.\n\nNow, check if x=2022 is a leap year? 2022 is not divisible by4 \u2192 no. The original y=2016 is leap. So check_leap(2022) is false, which matches the original leap (true)?"
