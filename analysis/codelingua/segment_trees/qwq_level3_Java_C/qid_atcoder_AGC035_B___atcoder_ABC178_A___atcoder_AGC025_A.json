Then, allocate for each node an array of size count[a]. Then, read the edges again and fill the adjacency lists. Wait, but that requires reading the edges twice. Alternatively, store the edges in a temporary array first. Alternatively, read all edges into a temporary array, then process them twice. Alternatively, in C, perhaps it's easier to use a linked list approach. Alternatively, let's proceed with the following steps:\n\nRead numNode and numEdge. Allocate an array of pointers to int arrays. Let's say:\n\nint **adj;\n\nadj = malloc(numNode * sizeof(int*));\n\nThen, for each node, we can have a count of edges, and then allocate the array. But first, we need to know the size for each node's adjacency list. So first, read all edges into a temporary array, then compute the counts. Let me code this:\n\nstruct Edge {\n    int a;\n    int b;\n};\n\nstruct Edge edges[numEdge]; // assuming numEdge is known, but in C, we can't have variable-length arrays unless using C99. Wait, but in C, variable-length arrays are allowed in C99. So if we read numEdge first, then:\n\nstruct Edge edges[numEdge];\n\nBut perhaps better to use dynamic allocation. Alternatively, read all edges into a dynamically allocated array. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to read the edges into a list, then build the adjacency lists. Alternatively, let's proceed step by step. First, read numNode and numEdge. Then, read all edges:\n\nint a, b;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < numEdge; i++) {\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n    a--; b--; // since Java subtracts 1.\n\n    // store in edges array. edges[i].a = a;\n\n    edges[i].b = b;\n\n}\n\nThen, compute the counts for each node's adjacency list:\n\nint *counts = calloc(numNode, sizeof(int));\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < numEdge; i++) {\n\n    counts[edges[i].a]++;\n\n    counts[edges[i].b]++;\n\n}\n\nThen, allocate the adjacency lists:\n\nadj = malloc(numNode * sizeof(int*));\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < numNode; i++) {\n\n    adj[i] = malloc(counts[i] * sizeof(int));\n\n}\n\nThen, reset the counts to 0 for writing:\n\nint *index = calloc(numNode, sizeof(int));\n\nThen, iterate over edges again to fill the adjacency lists:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < numEdge; i++) {\n\n    a = edges[i].a;\n\n    b = edges[i].b;\n\n    adj[a][index[a]++] = b;\n\n    adj[b][index[b]++] = a;\n\n}\n\nWait, but this requires storing all edges twice. Alternatively, perhaps we can do it in one pass, but it's manageable. Once the adjacency lists are built, then proceed with the DFS. Now, the DFS in C:\n\nWe need to track visited, odd, and the first_num. The variables in Java are:\n\nstatic ArrayList<Integer> connect[];\n\nstatic int visited[];\n\nstatic boolean odd[];\n\nstatic StringBuilder print;\n\nIn C, we can have arrays:\n\nint visited[numNode]; // assuming numNode is known. bool odd[numNode];\n\nBut in C, we need to declare these with the size known at compile time, but since numNode is read at runtime, we need to use dynamic allocation. So:\n\nint *visited = calloc(numNode, sizeof(int));\n\nbool *odd = calloc(numNode, sizeof(bool));\n\nAlso, we need to track the first_num.\n\nint first_num = -2; // uninitialized.",

So the order of the adjacency list for a node depends on the order of the edges. But in the C code, the adjacency lists are built by first storing all edges in an array, then processing them in order. So the order of the adjacency lists would be the same as in Java. Thus, the first pair generated in the DFS would be the same as in Java. Now, the DFS function in C: We need to implement the same logic as the Java code. Let me write the C code for the DFS function:\n\nvoid dfs(int crt, int parent) {\n\n    visited[crt] = 1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < adj_size[crt]; i++) {\n\n        int child = adj[crt][i];\n\n        if (child == parent || visited[child] == 1) {\n\n            continue;\n\n        } else if (visited[child] == 2) {\n\n            // append (crt+1, child+1) if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                first_num = crt + 1;\n\n            }\n\n            odd[crt] = !odd[crt];\n\n        } else {\n\n            dfs(child, crt);\n\n            if (odd[child]) {\n\n                // append (child+1, crt+1) if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                    first_num = child + 1;\n\n                }\n\n                odd[child] = !odd[child];\n\n            } else {\n\n                // append (crt+1, child+1) if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                    first_num = crt + 1;\n\n                }\n\n                odd[crt] = !odd[crt];\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    visited[crt] = 2;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the else clause (when visited[child] is 0), after the recursive call, we have to check odd[child], and then append the pair accordingly. Yes, that's correct. Now, after the DFS is called on node 0 (since the Java code starts with dfs(0, -1)), we can proceed. Putting it all together:\n\nThe steps in C:\n\nRead numNode and numEdge. If numEdge is odd:\n\n   first_num = -1. Else:\n\n   build adjacency lists. initialize visited and odd arrays to 0. first_num = -2.\n\n   call dfs(0, -1). if first_num is still -2 (unlikely, but possible?), then set to some default? Probably not needed. Then, proceed to the second step. Second step (Java File2's logic):\n\nx is first_num.\n\nresult = (x == 1) ? 0 : 1;\n\nWait, the Java code: bool = x ==1 ? true : false;\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nif (x ==1) \u2192 bool is true \u2192 result is 0.\n\nelse \u2192 bool is false \u2192 result is 1. So yes, result = (x !=1) ? 1 : 0. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0; So if bool is true (x is 1), then !bool is false \u2192 result is 0. Else, result is 1. Thus, result = (x ==1) ? 0 : 1. So in C:\n\nint x = first_num;\n\nint result = (x == 1) ? 0 : 1;\n\nThird step (Java File3's logic):\n\nN is result. Compute the minimal sum. The third program's code:\n\nsum function:\n\nint sum(int a) {\n\n    int ans =0;\n\n    while (a >=10) {\n\n        ans += a%10; a /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    ans +=a;\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nmain:\n\nread N.\n\ncompute n = N even \u2192 N/2, else (N+1)/2.\n\nans initialized to sum(1) + sum(N-1). loop A from 1 to n:\n\n   compute current = sum(A) + sum(N-A). if current < ans \u2192 update ans. Finally, print ans. Thus, in C:\n\nImplement the sum function. Then:\n\nint N = result;\n\nint n = (N %2 ==0) ? N/2 : (N+1)/2;\n\nint ans = sum(1) + sum(N-1);\n\nfor (int A=1; A <=n; A++) {\n\n    int current = sum(A) + sum(N -A);\n\n    if (current < ans) {\n\n        ans = current;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\nNow, putting all together.",

Wait in the sum function:\n\nsum(a) where a is negative? The code in Java's third program's sum function:\n\npublic static int sum(int a) {\n\n    int ans =0;\n\n    while (a >=10) {\n\n        ans += a%10; a /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    ans +=a;\n\n    return ans;\n\n} Wait, if a is negative, like -1, then the loop doesn't run (since -1 <10), so ans +=a \u2192 which is -1. So sum(-1) is -1. Thus, the initial ans would be sum(1) (1) + sum(-1) (-1) \u2192 0. Then the loop doesn't run (since n=0, A starts at 1, so loop doesn't execute). Thus, the answer is 0.

So, the main steps are:\n\nIf edges are odd:\n\n   x = -1. Else:\n\n   perform the DFS, and during the processing, track the first line's first number. The problem is to implement the DFS in C and capture the first output's first number. The DFS in Java's code is a bit complex. Let's look at the code again. The first Java program's DFS function:\n\nstatic void dfs(int crt, int parent) {\n\n    visited[crt] = 1;\n\n    for each child in connect[crt]:\n\n        if child is parent or already visited (1), skip.\n\n        else if visited[child] == 2 \u2192 then append (crt+1, child+1) to print, and toggle odd[crt].\n\n        else \u2192 recurse into child, then after returning:\n\n            if odd[child] is true \u2192 append (child+1, crt+1), toggle odd[child].\n\n            else \u2192 append (crt+1, child+1), toggle odd[crt].\n\n    visited[crt] = 2.\n\n} The print statements are building the output lines. The first line is the first such pair added to the print. The first line is the first pair generated in the DFS traversal. The first line's first number is the first element of the first pair.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding each Java file and how they interact when run in sequence.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (AGC035_B) reads input from stdin, processes it, and outputs some lines. The second file (ABC178_A) takes an integer x from stdin, does a simple calculation, and outputs a 0 or 1. The third file (AGC025_A) takes an integer N, computes some sum, and outputs the result.\n\nBut since they are supposed to be run in sequence, the output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third. Wait, but looking at the code:\n\nWait, the first program's output is the print statement in the first Java file. Let me check what each program does.\n\nFirst program (AGC035_B):\n\nIt reads numNode and numEdge, then builds a graph. Then, if the number of edges is odd, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it does a DFS and outputs pairs of nodes. The output is a series of lines with two numbers each, which is the result of the first program.\n\nThe second program (ABC178_A) takes an integer x from input. It checks if x is 1, then returns 0 if it's 1, else 1. Wait, the code is a bit convoluted. Let me see:\n\nx is parsed as an integer. Then bool is true if x is 1, else false. Then result is !bool ? 1 : 0. So if x is 1, result is 0, else 1. So the output is 0 or 1.\n\nThird program (AGC025_A) takes N from input, computes the minimal sum of digits of A and N-A for A up to N/2 or (N+1)/2. The output is that minimal sum.\n\nWait, but how do these three programs connect? The first program's output is lines of two integers. The second program expects a single integer x. So the first program's output is multiple lines, but the second program expects a single integer. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a single integer? Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's main method:\n\nThe first program's output is the print variable, which is a StringBuilder. The print statements in the dfs function add lines like \"a b\". So the output is multiple lines. But the second program expects a single integer x. So this suggests that the first program's output is not compatible with the second's input. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem description?\n\nWait the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. But the first program outputs multiple lines, which would be read as multiple integers by the second program? But the second program only reads one integer. Hmm, perhaps the first program's output is a single integer? Let me check again.\n\nWait the first program's code:\n\nThe first program's output is the print variable, which is built by appending lines. The print statement is System.out.println(print); which outputs all the lines. So the output is multiple lines. But the second program expects a single integer. That's a problem. Unless the first program's output is a single integer. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first program's code.\n\nWait looking at the first Java code again:\n\nThe first program's main method:\n\nif (numEdge % 2 !=0) then print -1 and return. Otherwise, it does a DFS and appends lines to the print. The print is then printed. So the output is multiple lines of two numbers each, unless the edge count is odd, in which case it's -1.\n\nSo the first program's output is either \"-1\" or multiple lines of two numbers. The second program expects an integer x. So the second program would read the first line of the first program's output as x. But if the first program outputs multiple lines, then the second program would read the first line (the first pair of numbers) as x? But that's two numbers, which would be a problem. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a single integer? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. The second's output is the input to the third. So the first program's output must be a single integer, but according to the code, it's multiple lines. That suggests that perhaps the first program's output is not being used correctly here. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a single integer. Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nWait the first program's code:\n\nThe print is a StringBuilder that appends lines like \"a b\". The final print statement is System.out.println(print); which outputs all the lines. So the output is multiple lines. Unless the problem is that the first program's output is being misused here. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or perhaps the first program's output is actually a single integer, but I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the number of edges or nodes? No, the code shows that it's outputting pairs of nodes. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the user intended that the first program's output is a single integer, but the code is different. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is not the three files in order, but maybe the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program only reads the first integer from the first program's output. For example, if the first program outputs multiple lines, the second program would read the first integer from the first line. But the second program expects a single integer x. Let me see the second program's code:\n\nThe second program's main reads x via scan.next(). So it reads the first token from the input. So if the first program's output is multiple lines, the second program would read the first number from the first line. For example, if the first program outputs \"3 4\\n5 6\", then the second program would read x as 3, then the rest is ignored. But the second program's output is 0 or 1, which is then the input to the third program. The third program expects an integer N, so the second's output (0 or 1) is read as N. So the third program would process that.\n\nWait, but the third program's code is expecting N to be an integer, which could be 0 or 1. But the third program's logic is to compute the minimal sum of digits of A and N-A. For N=0, that might be problematic, but perhaps the problem constraints allow it.\n\nSo the overall sequence is:\n\nFirst program's output is lines of two integers (or -1). The second program takes the first integer from the first line of that output, and outputs 0 or 1. The third program takes that 0 or 1 as N and computes the minimal sum.\n\nWait, but the first program's output could be \"-1\", which would be read as x = -1. Then the second program would process that. Let me see:\n\nSecond program's code:\n\nx is parsed as an integer. So if the first program outputs \"-1\", then x is -1. Then the code:\n\nbool = x ==1 ? true : false \u2192 so bool is false. Then result is !bool \u2192 true \u2192 so 1. So the second program would output 1. Then the third program would take that 1 as N, and compute the minimal sum for N=1.\n\nHmm, okay. So the sequence is possible, but the first program's output is being read as the first integer in its output. So the first program's output is a series of lines, but the second program only reads the first integer from the first line.\n\nTherefore, to translate this into a single C program, I need to process the three steps in sequence, passing data between them without I/O except first and last.\n\nThe first step (Java File1) is to read input, process it, and produce the first output (the lines). But in the C program, the first step's output is not printed, but instead passed to the second step's input. The second step (Java File2) takes that first output's first integer, processes it, and produces its output (0 or 1). The third step (Java File3) takes that 0 or 1 as input and produces the final output.\n\nWait, but in the C program, the first block (equivalent to Java File1) must read input, process it, and store the result (the first output's first integer) in some variable. Then the second block (Java File2's logic) takes that variable, processes it, and stores the result (0 or 1). Then the third block (Java File3's logic) takes that result and computes the final output, which is printed.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n1. Read input (from stdin) as the first Java program does.\n\n2. Process the first part (Java File1's logic) to compute the first output's first integer (the first number in the first line of its output).\n\n3. Then process the second part (Java File2's logic) using that first integer as input, resulting in 0 or 1.\n\n4. Then process the third part (Java File3's logic) using that 0 or 1 as N, compute the minimal sum, and print it.\n\nWait, but how do I get the first integer from the first program's output?\n\nThe first Java program's output is the lines generated by the print statements in the dfs function. The first line of that output is the first pair of numbers. The first number in that pair is the first integer of the first line. So the first integer is the first element of the first line.\n\nTherefore, in the C program, I need to simulate the first Java program's processing, but instead of printing all the lines, track the first integer of the first line of output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a list of edges, but the second program only needs the first integer of the first line. So the first program's processing must be done, and during that processing, we can capture the first integer of the first output line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's first output line is the first pair of nodes, so the first number is the first element of that pair. To capture that, during the processing of the first part in C, I need to track when the first output line is generated and record the first number.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each Java program's logic and see what their outputs are.\n\nFirst Java Program (AGC035_B):\n\nThis is a graph problem. The code builds an adjacency list for an undirected graph. Then, if the number of edges is odd, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it performs a DFS to generate some edges and outputs pairs of nodes. The output is a series of lines, each with two numbers. The exact output depends on the DFS processing.\n\nThe key point is that the first line of output is the first pair generated by the DFS. The first number in that pair is the first integer of the first line, which is what the second program will read as x.\n\nThe second program (ABC178_A) takes that x and outputs 0 if x is 1, else 1.\n\nThe third program (AGC025_A) takes that result (0 or 1) as N and computes the minimal sum of digits of A and N-A for A from 1 to N/2 or so.\n\nWait, but for N=0, the third program would have N=0, which might be problematic. Let's see:\n\nIn the third program's code, N is read, then n is set to N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2. But if N is 0, then N/2 is 0, so n=0. Then the loop for A from 1 to 0 would not execute. The initial ans is sum(1) + sum(-1). Wait, but N is 0, so N - A would be -1, which is invalid. Wait, but in the code, N is read as an integer. So if N is 0, then the code would have A starting at 1, but N - A would be negative. That's a problem. But perhaps the problem constraints ensure that N is positive. Since the second program can output 0 or 1, but when N is 0, the third program would have issues. However, according to the second program's logic, if the first program's output's first integer is 1, then the second program outputs 0, which would be N=0 for the third program. So that's a possible scenario.\n\nBut perhaps the first program's output can't have a first integer of 1? Not sure. Anyway, the code must handle it as per the given Java code.\n\nNow, the challenge is to translate all three into a single C program, with only the first part reading input, the last part writing output, and the middle parts processing data in memory.\n\nSo, the steps in C:\n\n1. Read input (numNode and numEdge, then edges) from stdin.\n\n2. Process the first Java program's logic (the graph processing and DFS), but instead of printing the output lines, track the first integer of the first line of output.\n\n3. Use that first integer as x for the second program's logic (compute 0 or 1).\n\n4. Use that result as N for the third program's logic, compute the minimal sum, and print it.\n\nTherefore, the key is to simulate the first Java program's processing, but capture the first integer of its first output line.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the first part in C.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first part reads the number of nodes and edges, builds the adjacency list, then if edges are odd, outputs -1. Otherwise, does a DFS and outputs the edges in some way.\n\nThe output is either \"-1\" or a series of lines. So, in the C code, if the number of edges is odd, then the first output is \"-1\", so the first integer is -1. Otherwise, the first line is the first pair of nodes from the DFS processing.\n\nSo, in the C code, we need to:\n\n- Read the input (numNode, numEdge, then edges).\n\n- Check if numEdge is odd. If yes, then the first output is -1 \u2192 so x is -1.\n\n- Else, perform the DFS and track the first line's first number.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\nIf edges are odd:\n\n   x = -1.\n\nElse:\n\n   perform the DFS, and during the processing, track the first line's first number.\n\nThe problem is to implement the DFS in C and capture the first output's first number.\n\nThe DFS in Java's code is a bit complex. Let's look at the code again.\n\nThe first Java program's DFS function:\n\nstatic void dfs(int crt, int parent) {\n\n    visited[crt] = 1;\n\n    for each child in connect[crt]:\n\n        if child is parent or already visited (1), skip.\n\n        else if visited[child] == 2 \u2192 then append (crt+1, child+1) to print, and toggle odd[crt].\n\n        else \u2192 recurse into child, then after returning:\n\n            if odd[child] is true \u2192 append (child+1, crt+1), toggle odd[child].\n\n            else \u2192 append (crt+1, child+1), toggle odd[crt].\n\n    visited[crt] = 2.\n\n}\n\nThe print statements are building the output lines. The first line is the first such pair added to the print.\n\nThe first line is the first pair generated in the DFS traversal.\n\nThe first line's first number is the first element of the first pair.\n\nSo, in the C code, during the DFS, whenever a pair is added to the output (i.e., when the print.append is called), we can capture the first such pair's first element and break early once we have it, but that might not be possible because the first pair could be generated deep in the recursion.\n\nAlternatively, we can track all the pairs generated, but only need the first one's first element.\n\nAlternatively, during the DFS, whenever a pair is added, we can note the first occurrence and store it.\n\nSo, in C, we can have a variable to store the first integer of the first line. Let's call it first_num.\n\nInitialize first_num to -1 (or some invalid value). Then, whenever a pair is added to the output (i.e., when any of the print.append calls happen), we check if first_num is still unset. If so, set first_num to the first element of the pair, and break out of processing once we have it? Wait, but the DFS might continue, but we only need the first occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, we can process the entire DFS, collect all the pairs, then take the first one's first element. But that might be memory-intensive for large graphs, but given that the problem requires equivalence, it's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, since the first pair is the first one generated in the DFS, perhaps the first pair is the first edge processed in the traversal. Let's see how the DFS works.\n\nThe DFS starts at node 0 (since the initial call is dfs(0, -1). The first child of node 0 (in the adjacency list) is processed first. Let's see:\n\nThe first step is to visit node 0, mark visited as 1. Then iterate over its connections (children). For each child (excluding parent, which is -1 initially):\n\nSuppose the first child is a. Then, since visited[a] is 0, we call dfs(a, 0).\n\nIn the dfs(a, 0) call, it proceeds similarly. The first pair added would be when the recursion returns.\n\nWait, perhaps the first pair is added when backtracking from the leaves.\n\nThis is getting complicated. To capture the first pair's first element, perhaps the easiest way is to simulate the entire process, collect all the pairs, then take the first one's first element.\n\nBut in C, how to do that?\n\nWe can create an array or a linked list to store the pairs generated. Since the number of edges is up to some limit (but the problem doesn't specify, but assuming it's manageable), we can use an array.\n\nAlternatively, since we only need the first element of the first pair, perhaps we can track it as soon as it's generated.\n\nLet me think of the steps in the DFS:\n\nThe first pair is generated either in the first call's processing or in a deeper recursion.\n\nThe first time any of the print.append() is called, that's the first pair. So in C, during the DFS, whenever we would have printed a pair, we can check if first_num is still unset. If so, set first_num to the first element of the pair, and continue processing (since we need to complete the DFS to ensure correctness, but we just need to capture the first occurrence).\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the entire sequence of the three Java programs must be equivalent. So the first program's output must be exactly the same as the original, except that we don't print it, but instead capture the first integer. However, the second program only reads the first integer of the first line, so the rest of the output is irrelevant for the second program. Therefore, as long as the first integer is correctly captured, the rest can be ignored.\n\nTherefore, in the C code, during the first program's processing, we can track the first pair's first element, and then proceed to the second step.\n\nSo, in C:\n\nWe can have a variable first_num initialized to -2 (or some invalid value). Whenever any of the print operations would occur (i.e., when appending a line to the output), we check if first_num is still unset. If so, set first_num to the first number of the pair, and continue processing.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Read input (numNode, numEdge, edges).\n\n- If numEdge is odd \u2192 first_num = -1.\n\n- Else:\n\n   build adjacency list.\n\n   perform DFS, tracking the first pair's first number.\n\n   first_num is the first element of the first pair generated.\n\nThen, proceed to the second step (Java File2's logic) using first_num as x.\n\nThen, proceed to the third step (Java File3's logic) using the result of the second step as N.\n\nNow, implementing the first part in C.\n\nFirst, the adjacency list. In Java, it's an array of ArrayLists. In C, we can represent it as an array of linked lists or arrays. Since the number of nodes is up to, say, 1e5? Not sure, but assuming manageable size.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to translate the code, perhaps the constraints are small enough. Let's proceed.\n\nImplementing the adjacency list in C:\n\nWe can use an array of arrays. But since the number of edges per node can vary, perhaps using dynamic arrays. Alternatively, since in Java it's an ArrayList, in C we can use a linked list structure or a fixed array with pointers.\n\nAlternatively, for simplicity, let's use an array of linked lists. Each node's adjacency list is a linked list.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, for each edge a-b, we add b to a's list and a to b's list.\n\nIn C:\n\nWe can have an array of pointers to linked list nodes. Each node's adjacency list is a linked list.\n\nAlternatively, for simplicity, let's use an array of arrays. But since the size is unknown, perhaps better to use dynamic allocation.\n\nAlternatively, let's use a structure for adjacency lists. Let's think of the following steps:\n\nFirst, read numNode and numEdge.\n\nThen, for each node, create an array of integers to store its neighbors. Since in Java, the ArrayList is dynamically sized, in C, perhaps we can use a flexible array or a list implemented with realloc.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are read in pairs, we can first read all edges, store them in an array, then build the adjacency lists.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to first read all edges, store them in an array, then build the adjacency lists.\n\nWait, but the edges are bidirectional. So for each edge a-b, we need to add b to a's list and a to b's list.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead numNode and numEdge.\n\nThen read numEdge pairs of a and b (0-based in Java, since they subtract 1).\n\nStore all edges in an array.\n\nThen build the adjacency lists.\n\nBut in C, to build the adjacency lists, we can have an array of linked lists or arrays.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, we can have an array of pointers to an array of integers. Let's see:\n\nWe can have an array of pointers to int arrays. For each node, we can dynamically allocate an array as needed.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, perhaps we can first count the number of edges per node, then allocate the arrays.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nFirst, read numNode and numEdge.\n\nThen, read all edges, and count the number of edges per node (for each a and b, increment count[a] and count[b]).\n\nThen, allocate for each node an array of size count[a].\n\nThen, read the edges again and fill the adjacency lists.\n\nWait, but that requires reading the edges twice. Alternatively, store the edges in a temporary array first.\n\nAlternatively, read all edges into a temporary array, then process them twice.\n\nAlternatively, in C, perhaps it's easier to use a linked list approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed with the following steps:\n\nRead numNode and numEdge.\n\nAllocate an array of pointers to int arrays. Let's say:\n\nint **adj;\n\nadj = malloc(numNode * sizeof(int*));\n\nThen, for each node, we can have a count of edges, and then allocate the array.\n\nBut first, we need to know the size for each node's adjacency list.\n\nSo first, read all edges into a temporary array, then compute the counts.\n\nLet me code this:\n\nstruct Edge {\n    int a;\n    int b;\n};\n\nstruct Edge edges[numEdge]; // assuming numEdge is known, but in C, we can't have variable-length arrays unless using C99.\n\nWait, but in C, variable-length arrays are allowed in C99. So if we read numEdge first, then:\n\nstruct Edge edges[numEdge];\n\nBut perhaps better to use dynamic allocation.\n\nAlternatively, read all edges into a dynamically allocated array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to read the edges into a list, then build the adjacency lists.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read numNode and numEdge.\n\nThen, read all edges:\n\nint a, b;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < numEdge; i++) {\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n    a--; b--; // since Java subtracts 1.\n\n    // store in edges array.\n\n    edges[i].a = a;\n\n    edges[i].b = b;\n\n}\n\nThen, compute the counts for each node's adjacency list:\n\nint *counts = calloc(numNode, sizeof(int));\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < numEdge; i++) {\n\n    counts[edges[i].a]++;\n\n    counts[edges[i].b]++;\n\n}\n\nThen, allocate the adjacency lists:\n\nadj = malloc(numNode * sizeof(int*));\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < numNode; i++) {\n\n    adj[i] = malloc(counts[i] * sizeof(int));\n\n}\n\nThen, reset the counts to 0 for writing:\n\nint *index = calloc(numNode, sizeof(int));\n\nThen, iterate over edges again to fill the adjacency lists:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < numEdge; i++) {\n\n    a = edges[i].a;\n\n    b = edges[i].b;\n\n    adj[a][index[a]++] = b;\n\n    adj[b][index[b]++] = a;\n\n}\n\nWait, but this requires storing all edges twice. Alternatively, perhaps we can do it in one pass, but it's manageable.\n\nOnce the adjacency lists are built, then proceed with the DFS.\n\nNow, the DFS in C:\n\nWe need to track visited, odd, and the first_num.\n\nThe variables in Java are:\n\nstatic ArrayList<Integer> connect[];\n\nstatic int visited[];\n\nstatic boolean odd[];\n\nstatic StringBuilder print;\n\nIn C, we can have arrays:\n\nint visited[numNode]; // assuming numNode is known.\n\nbool odd[numNode];\n\nBut in C, we need to declare these with the size known at compile time, but since numNode is read at runtime, we need to use dynamic allocation.\n\nSo:\n\nint *visited = calloc(numNode, sizeof(int));\n\nbool *odd = calloc(numNode, sizeof(bool));\n\nAlso, we need to track the first_num.\n\nint first_num = -2; // uninitialized.\n\nNow, the DFS function in C:\n\nWe can implement it recursively, but need to pass the adjacency lists and other variables.\n\nAlternatively, since C doesn't have pass-by-reference for arrays, perhaps we can use global variables for the arrays, but that's not thread-safe but okay here.\n\nAlternatively, use function parameters.\n\nAlternatively, since the code is self-contained, perhaps using global variables for the arrays is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let's structure the code with the DFS as a function.\n\nWait, in C, functions can't return multiple values easily, so perhaps using global variables for visited, odd, and first_num is easier.\n\nAlternatively, encapsulate them in a struct.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's use global variables for the arrays and first_num.\n\nWait, but in C, variables declared outside functions are global by default.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nint first_num = -2;\n\nint *visited;\n\nbool *odd;\n\nint **adj;\n\nint numNode;\n\nvoid dfs(int crt, int parent) {\n\n    visited[crt] = 1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < adj[crt].length; i++) { // but how to know the length?\n\nWait, here's a problem: in the adjacency list, each node's list has a variable length. So in C, we need to know how many neighbors each node has.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Because in the Java code, the adjacency list is an ArrayList, so the size is known via .size().\n\nIn C, since we built the adjacency lists as arrays with counts, we can have another array to store the counts.\n\nWait, earlier steps:\n\nWe have counts array which stored the number of edges per node. So we can have an array called adj_size, where adj_size[i] is the number of neighbors for node i.\n\nSo:\n\nint *adj_size = malloc(numNode * sizeof(int));\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < numNode; i++) {\n\n    adj_size[i] = counts[i]; // from earlier step.\n\n}\n\nThen, in the DFS function:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < adj_size[crt]; i++) {\n\n    int child = adj[crt][i];\n\n    if (child == parent || visited[child] == 1) {\n\n        continue;\n\n    } else if (visited[child] == 2) {\n\n        // append (crt+1, child+1) to output.\n\n        if (first_num == -2) {\n\n            first_num = crt + 1;\n\n        }\n\n        // toggle odd[crt]\n\n        odd[crt] = !odd[crt];\n\n    } else {\n\n        dfs(child, crt);\n\n        if (odd[child]) {\n\n            // append (child+1, crt+1)\n\n            if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                first_num = child + 1;\n\n            }\n\n            // toggle odd[child]\n\n            odd[child] = !odd[child];\n\n        } else {\n\n            // append (crt+1, child+1)\n\n            if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                first_num = crt + 1;\n\n            }\n\n            odd[crt] = !odd[crt];\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the code after the else (when visited[child] is 0) is:\n\nelse {\n\n    dfs(child, crt);\n\n    if (odd[child]) {\n\n        print.append( (child+1) + \" \" + (crt+1) + \"\\n\");\n\n        odd[child] = !odd[child];\n\n    } else {\n\n        print.append( (crt+1) + \" \" + (child+1) + \"\\n\");\n\n        odd[crt] = !odd[crt];\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo in the else clause (when visited[child] is 0), after the recursive call, we check odd[child], and append the appropriate pair.\n\nIn the C code, whenever we append a pair, we need to check if first_num is still unset and set it to the first element of the pair.\n\nThus, in the code above, whenever any of the append operations would occur (i.e., when the print.append is called in Java), we check if first_num is still -2 and set it to the first element of the pair.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nIn the case of visited[child] == 2:\n\nWe have to append (crt+1, child+1). So the first element is crt+1. So when this happens, if first_num is unset, set it to crt+1.\n\nIn the else clause (visited[child] is 0):\n\nAfter the recursive call, if odd[child] is true, then append (child+1, crt+1). The first element is child+1. So set first_num to that if unset.\n\nElse, append (crt+1, child+1), so first element is crt+1.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nIn the case of visited[child] == 2:\n\nif (first_num == -2) first_num = crt +1;\n\nThen, toggle odd[crt].\n\nIn the else clause (visited[child] is 0):\n\nAfter the recursive call:\n\nif (odd[child]):\n\n   if (first_num == -2) first_num = child +1;\n\n   toggle odd[child]\n\nelse:\n\n   if (first_num == -2) first_num = crt +1;\n\n   toggle odd[crt]\n\nThus, the code in C's DFS function would need to handle these cases.\n\nBut also, the order of processing the children may affect which pair is first. The Java code processes the children in the order of the adjacency list (ArrayList's order). In C, the adjacency list is stored in the order they were added. Since in the Java code, the edges are added in the order they were read, but the adjacency lists are built by adding each edge's b to a's list and a to b's list. So the order of the adjacency list for a node depends on the order of the edges.\n\nBut in the C code, the adjacency lists are built by first storing all edges in an array, then processing them in order. So the order of the adjacency lists would be the same as in Java.\n\nThus, the first pair generated in the DFS would be the same as in Java.\n\nNow, the DFS function in C:\n\nWe need to implement the same logic as the Java code.\n\nLet me write the C code for the DFS function:\n\nvoid dfs(int crt, int parent) {\n\n    visited[crt] = 1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < adj_size[crt]; i++) {\n\n        int child = adj[crt][i];\n\n        if (child == parent || visited[child] == 1) {\n\n            continue;\n\n        } else if (visited[child] == 2) {\n\n            // append (crt+1, child+1)\n\n            if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                first_num = crt + 1;\n\n            }\n\n            odd[crt] = !odd[crt];\n\n        } else {\n\n            dfs(child, crt);\n\n            if (odd[child]) {\n\n                // append (child+1, crt+1)\n\n                if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                    first_num = child + 1;\n\n                }\n\n                odd[child] = !odd[child];\n\n            } else {\n\n                // append (crt+1, child+1)\n\n                if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                    first_num = crt + 1;\n\n                }\n\n                odd[crt] = !odd[crt];\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    visited[crt] = 2;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the else clause (when visited[child] is 0), after the recursive call, we have to check odd[child], and then append the pair accordingly.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, after the DFS is called on node 0 (since the Java code starts with dfs(0, -1)), we can proceed.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe steps in C:\n\nRead numNode and numEdge.\n\nIf numEdge is odd:\n\n   first_num = -1.\n\nElse:\n\n   build adjacency lists.\n\n   initialize visited and odd arrays to 0.\n\n   first_num = -2.\n\n   call dfs(0, -1).\n\n   if first_num is still -2 (unlikely, but possible?), then set to some default? Probably not needed.\n\nThen, proceed to the second step.\n\nSecond step (Java File2's logic):\n\nx is first_num.\n\nresult = (x == 1) ? 0 : 1;\n\nWait, the Java code:\n\nbool = x ==1 ? true : false;\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nif (x ==1) \u2192 bool is true \u2192 result is 0.\n\nelse \u2192 bool is false \u2192 result is 1.\n\nSo yes, result = (x !=1) ? 1 : 0.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nSo if bool is true (x is 1), then !bool is false \u2192 result is 0.\n\nElse, result is 1.\n\nThus, result = (x ==1) ? 0 : 1.\n\nSo in C:\n\nint x = first_num;\n\nint result = (x == 1) ? 0 : 1;\n\nThird step (Java File3's logic):\n\nN is result.\n\nCompute the minimal sum.\n\nThe third program's code:\n\nsum function:\n\nint sum(int a) {\n\n    int ans =0;\n\n    while (a >=10) {\n\n        ans += a%10;\n\n        a /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    ans +=a;\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nmain:\n\nread N.\n\ncompute n = N even \u2192 N/2, else (N+1)/2.\n\nans initialized to sum(1) + sum(N-1).\n\nloop A from 1 to n:\n\n   compute current = sum(A) + sum(N-A).\n\n   if current < ans \u2192 update ans.\n\nFinally, print ans.\n\nThus, in C:\n\nImplement the sum function.\n\nThen:\n\nint N = result;\n\nint n = (N %2 ==0) ? N/2 : (N+1)/2;\n\nint ans = sum(1) + sum(N-1);\n\nfor (int A=1; A <=n; A++) {\n\n    int current = sum(A) + sum(N -A);\n\n    if (current < ans) {\n\n        ans = current;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the C code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n// Global variables for the first part.\n\nint first_num = -2;\n\nint **adj;\n\nint *adj_size;\n\nint *visited;\n\nbool *odd;\n\nint numNode;\n\nvoid dfs(int crt, int parent) {\n\n    visited[crt] = 1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < adj_size[crt]; i++) {\n\n        int child = adj[crt][i];\n\n        if (child == parent || visited[child] == 1) {\n\n            continue;\n\n        } else if (visited[child] == 2) {\n\n            // append (crt+1, child+1)\n\n            if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                first_num = crt + 1;\n\n            }\n\n            odd[crt] = !odd[crt];\n\n        } else {\n\n            dfs(child, crt);\n\n            if (odd[child]) {\n\n                // append (child+1, crt+1)\n\n                if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                    first_num = child + 1;\n\n                }\n\n                odd[child] = !odd[child];\n\n            } else {\n\n                // append (crt+1, child+1)\n\n                if (first_num == -2) {\n\n                    first_num = crt + 1;\n\n                }\n\n                odd[crt] = !odd[crt];\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    visited[crt] = 2;\n\n}\n\nint sum(int a) {\n\n    int ans =0;\n\n    while (a >=10) {\n\n        ans += a%10;\n\n        a /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    ans +=a;\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nint main() {\n\n    int numNode, numEdge;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &numNode, &numEdge);\n\n    if (numEdge %2 !=0) {\n\n        first_num = -1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        // Read edges and build adjacency lists.\n\n        // First, read all edges into a temporary array.\n\n        struct Edge {\n\n            int a;\n\n            int b;\n\n        };\n\n        struct Edge *edges = malloc(numEdge * sizeof(struct Edge));\n\n        for (int i=0; i < numEdge; i++) {\n\n            int a, b;\n\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n            a--; b--;\n\n            edges[i].a = a;\n\n            edges[i].b = b;\n\n        }\n\n        // Compute counts for each node.\n\n        int *counts = calloc(numNode, sizeof(int));\n\n        for (int i=0; i < numEdge; i++) {\n\n            counts[edges[i].a]++;\n\n            counts[edges[i].b]++;\n\n        }\n\n        // Allocate adjacency lists.\n\n        adj = malloc(numNode * sizeof(int*));\n\n        adj_size = malloc(numNode * sizeof(int));\n\n        for (int i=0; i < numNode; i++) {\n\n            adj_size[i] = counts[i];\n\n            adj[i] = malloc(counts[i] * sizeof(int));\n\n        }\n\n        // Reset counts to 0 for writing.\n\n        int *index = calloc(numNode, sizeof(int));\n\n        for (int i=0; i < numEdge; i++) {\n\n            int a = edges[i].a;\n\n            int b = edges[i].b;\n\n            adj[a][index[a]++] = b;\n\n            adj[b][index[b]++] = a;\n\n        }\n\n        free(index);\n\n        free(counts);\n\n        free(edges);\n\n        // Initialize visited and odd arrays.\n\n        visited = calloc(numNode, sizeof(int));\n\n        odd = calloc(numNode, sizeof(bool));\n\n        first_num = -2;\n\n        // Call DFS starting at node 0.\n\n        dfs(0, -1);\n\n        free(visited);\n\n        free(odd);\n\n        for (int i=0; i < numNode; i++) {\n\n            free(adj[i]);\n\n        }\n\n        free(adj);\n\n        free(adj_size);\n\n    }\n\n    // Second step: compute result.\n\n    int x = first_num;\n\n    int result = (x ==1) ? 0 : 1;\n\n    // Third step: compute the minimal sum.\n\n    int N = result;\n\n    int n = (N %2 ==0) ?

So first_num should be set.\n\nAlso, in the code, after building the adjacency lists, we have to free the edges and counts arrays.\n\nAlso, in the DFS function, the adj and adj_size are global variables, so they must be properly initialized before the call.\n\nAnother thing: in the code, after the first part (the else clause), we free the visited and odd arrays, but they were allocated with calloc. Also, the adj arrays are freed properly.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose the first program outputs \"-1\" (because edges are odd). Then first_num is -1. The second program's x is -1 \u2192 result is 1 (since -1 !=1 \u2192 result is 1). Then third program's N is 1. So compute the minimal sum for N=1.\n\nsum(1) + sum(0) \u2192 but wait, N=1, so A can be up to (1+1)/2 =1.\n\nLoop A from 1 to 1:\n\nA=1 \u2192 N-A =0.\n\nsum(1) is 1, sum(0) is 0 \u2192 total 1.\n\nThe initial ans is sum(1)+sum(0) =1+0=1. So the answer is 1.\n\nThus, the third program would output 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose first program's first line is \"2 3\", so first_num is 2. Then second program's result is 0 (since 2 !=1 \u2192 result is 1? Wait no:\n\nWait x is 2 \u2192 x !=1 \u2192 result is 1. So N is 1. Then third program's N is 1, same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second step's logic.\n\nWait, the second program's result is (x ==1) ? 0 :1. So if x is 2 \u2192 result is 1. So N is 1.\n\nThus, the third program's output is 1.\n\nAnother test case where first_num is 1:\n\nThen second program's result is 0. N=0.\n\nThen third program's N=0.\n\nThe code for third program:\n\nn = (0%2==0 \u2192 yes \u2192 0/2=0.\n\nans is sum(1) + sum(-1). Wait, but sum is called with -1, which is invalid.\n\nWait, but in the third program's code, N is read as an integer. If N is 0, then N-A must be non-negative?\n\nWait in the third program's code:\n\nfor A from 1 to n (which is 0 in this case). The loop doesn't run. So the initial ans is sum(1) + sum(-1).\n\nBut sum(-1) would be problematic.\n\nWait in the sum function:\n\nsum(a) where a is negative?\n\nThe code in Java's third program's sum function:\n\npublic static int sum(int a) {\n\n    int ans =0;\n\n    while (a >=10) {\n\n        ans += a%10;\n\n        a /=10;\n\n    }\n\n    ans +=a;\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nWait, if a is negative, like -1, then the loop doesn't run (since -1 <10), so ans +=a \u2192 which is -1. So sum(-1) is -1.\n\nThus, the initial ans would be sum(1) (1) + sum(-1) (-1) \u2192 0.\n\nThen the loop doesn't run (since n=0, A starts at 1, so loop doesn't execute).\n\nThus, the answer is 0.\n\nBut in the third program's code, when N=0, the loop for A from 1 to 0 is skipped, so the initial ans is 0.\n\nThus, the third program would output 0.\n\nBut in the C code, the sum function would have the same behavior.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the code seems correct, but there are some potential issues with memory management and array indices.\n\nAnother thing: in the C code, the adj array is built with the edges stored in the order they were read, but in the Java code, the edges are added in the order of the input. So the adjacency lists' order is the same, so the DFS should proceed the same way.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, I'll write the final C code accordingly."
