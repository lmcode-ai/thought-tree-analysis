Test case for first part:\n\nSuppose n=1, m=1, req[0]=5, pre[0]=3. Then in the loop:\n\ni starts at 0, j at 0.\n\nreq[0] (5) > pre[0] (3) \u2192 ans1 becomes 1. Then j stays 0, but i is decremented to -1. The loop condition (i >=0) is false, so loop ends. val1 = 1 + (-1) +1 =1. Second part: val1 is 1. The sum is for i from 1 to 1:\n\nd =1/1=1 \u2192 term is 1 *1*(2)/2 =1 \u2192 sum is 1. So val2 is 1. Third part: K=1. Then:\n\nCheck 1%2 and 1%5 \u2192 no. Then check 1%7 \u2192 no. So K remains 1, multiply by9 \u2192 K=9. Then remainder is 10 mod9 =1 \u2192 ans is 1. So output is 1. Another test case:\n\nFirst program's code:\n\nSuppose n=3, m=2, req = [3,1,4], pre = [2,5]. Processing:\n\ni starts at 2 (n-1=2), j=1 (m-1=1). Compare req[2]=4 vs pre[1]=5 \u2192 4>5? No. So j-- \u2192 j=0. i becomes 1. Next iteration: i=1, j=0. Compare req[1]=1 vs pre[0]=2 \u2192 1>2? No \u2192 j-- \u2192 j=-1. Now loop ends. ans1 is 0 (since only the first iteration didn't increment ans1, and the second didn't either). val1 = 0 + (1) (since after the loop, i was 1, but after the i-- in the loop, let's see:\n\nWait let me retrace step by step: Initial i=2, j=1. First iteration:\n\nCheck req[2] (4) > pre[1] (5)? 4>5 \u2192 no. So j becomes 0. Then i is decremented to 1. Loop continues (i=1 >=0, j=0 >=0). Second iteration:\n\nreq[1] (1) > pre[0] (2)? 1>2 \u2192 no. So j becomes -1. Then i is decremented to 0. Now, loop condition: i=0 >=0, j=-1 <0 \u2192 loop stops. So after loop, i is 0 (since after the second iteration's i-- \u2192 1-1=0). Wait, let me retrace: Wait, in the first iteration:\n\nAfter the if-else, we do i--. So first iteration: i starts at 2. Check req[2] (4) vs pre[1] (5). 4>5? No \u2192 j-- to 0.\n\nThen i-- \u2192 2-1=1. Second iteration: i is 1, j is 0. Check req[1] (1) vs pre[0] (2). 1>2? No \u2192 j-- to -1. Then i-- \u2192 1-1=0. Now, loop condition: i is 0 (>=0), j is -1 \u2192 loop stops. Thus, after loop, i is 0, j is -1. So val1 = ans1 (0) + i (0) +1 \u2192 0+0+1=1. So val1 is 1. Then second part's val2 is 1 \u2192 same as before, leading to result 1. Hmm, okay. Another test case for third part:\n\nSuppose val2 is 7. Third part:\n\nK=7. Check 7%2=1, 7%5=2 \u2192 okay. Check divisible by7 \u2192 yes. So K becomes 1. Multiply by9 \u2192 K=9. Then remainder is 10 mod9=1 \u2192 ans is 1. So output is 1. Another case where K=3:\n\nval2=3 \u2192 K=3.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these three Java programs into a single C program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_387_B) reads two integers n and m, then two arrays req and pre. It processes them with a while loop, comparing elements from the end, and calculates an answer which is printed. The output of this is probably used as input for the next program.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC172_D) takes an integer n, computes a sum involving division and multiplication, then outputs that sum. Its input would be the output from the first program.\n\nThe third Java file (atcoder_ABC174_C) reads an integer K, does some calculations involving modulo operations, and returns a result. Its input is the output from the second program.\n\nSo the C program must read the initial input, process through all three steps without I/O in between, and output the final result.\n\nLet me break down each step:\n\nFirst program's input is from stdin. The first step is to read n and m, then the req and pre arrays. The processing here is the while loop comparing elements. The output is ans + i + 1. Wait, in the code, after the loop, i would have been decremented past 0, so the final value of i is -1? Let me see:\n\nInitially, i starts at n-1, j at m-1. The loop runs while i and j are >=0. Each iteration, i is decremented. So when the loop ends, either i is -1 or j is -1. The final ans is ans + i +1. Wait, if i is -1, then ans + (-1) +1 = ans. If j is -1, then i could be some value. Hmm, but the code's logic is that the answer is ans plus (i +1). Let me see the code again:\n\nThe code's final print is System.out.print(ans + i + 1). So the first program's output is (ans + i +1). Wait, but after the loop, i is the index that was last decremented. Let me think through an example. Suppose n=3, m=2. Suppose during the loop, i goes down to 0, then -1. Then the loop stops. So i would be -1, and j would be whatever. So the final value would be ans + (-1) +1 = ans. Hmm, but maybe I need to track that correctly.\n\nAnyway, the first program's output is the value of ans + i +1. That's the first step's output, which is the input for the second program.\n\nThe second program takes that number as its n, computes the sum, and outputs that sum. Then the third program takes that sum as K, and processes it.\n\nWait, but the third program's input is K, which is read via readInt(). So the second program's output is the input to the third program. So the second program's output is the value of the sum, which is then used as K in the third program.\n\nSo the C program must:\n\n1. Read the initial input (n and m, then the req and pre arrays) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (ans + i +1).\n\n3. Use that result as the input to the second program's n, compute the sum, then get that sum as the next value.\n\n4. Use that sum as K in the third program, compute the final result, and output it.\n\nTherefore, the C program must:\n\n- Read all the inputs (n, m, req array, pre array) from stdin.\n\n- Process through the first algorithm to get the first output value (let's call it val1).\n\n- Then process val1 through the second algorithm to get val2.\n\n- Then process val2 through the third algorithm to get the final result, which is printed.\n\nNow, translating each part into C.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part (codeforces_387_B):\n\nIn C, arrays can be handled with dynamic memory or fixed size. Since the input sizes are n and m, which can be up to... Well, in Java, the code uses ArrayLists, but in C, we can read the numbers into arrays. Let's see:\n\nFirst step:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n integers into req array.\n\nThen read m integers into pre array.\n\nThen process the while loop.\n\nInitialize i = n-1, j = m-1, ans =0.\n\nLoop while i >=0 and j >=0:\n\nif req[i] > pre[j], then ans++, else j--.\n\nThen decrement i each time.\n\nAfter loop, compute val1 = ans + i +1.\n\nWait, but in C, arrays are 0-based, so same as Java here.\n\nNow, the second part (atcoder_ABC172_D):\n\nThe second program takes an integer n (which is val1 from first step), and computes the sum ans += i * (n/i) * (n/i +1)/2 for i from 1 to n.\n\nWait, the code in Java is:\n\nfor (int i =1; i < n+1; i++) { ... }\n\nSo i runs from 1 to n inclusive.\n\nThe formula is (long) i * (n/i) * ( (n/i)+1 ) / 2. So each term is i multiplied by (n//i) multiplied by (n//i +1) divided by 2, then multiplied by i? Wait, no, the code is:\n\nans += (long)i * ( (n/i) * ( (n/i)+1 ) / 2 )\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nans += (long)i * ( ( (long)n / (long)i ) * ( ( (long)n / (long)i ) +1 ) / 2 )\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nans += (long)i * ( ( (long)n / (long)i ) * ( ( (long)n / (long)i ) +1 ) / 2 )\n\nWait, the term inside is (n/i) * (n/i +1)/2, multiplied by i. So the term is i * (d*(d+1)/2), where d = n/i.\n\nSo in C, for each i from 1 to val1 (since val1 is the n here), compute that term and add to ans.\n\nThe result is val2 = ans.\n\nThird part (atcoder_ABC174_C):\n\nThe third program takes K as input (which is val2 from second step). The code does:\n\nif K is even or divisible by 5, return -1.\n\nIf K is divisible by 7, divide by 7.\n\nMultiply K by 9.\n\nThen find the smallest ans where 10^ans mod (K) == 1 mod K.\n\nWait, the code in the third Java program:\n\nprivate static int solve() throws IOException {\n    int K = readInt();\n    if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n    if (K % 7 == 0) K /=7;\n    K *=9;\n    int ans =1;\n    int remainder =10%K;\n    while(remainder !=1) {\n        ans++;\n        remainder = (remainder *10) % K;\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, but the code first checks if K is even or divisible by 5, returns -1. Then, if divisible by 7, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9. Then compute the remainder steps.\n\nWait, but in the code, after dividing by 7, K is multiplied by 9. So the K here is (original K divided by 7, if applicable) multiplied by 9?\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nOriginal K is the input (val2 from second step).\n\nFirst, if K is even or divisible by 5, return -1.\n\nElse, check if K is divisible by 7. If yes, divide by 7.\n\nThen multiply K by 9.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (K %7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nthen K *=9;\n\nSo the new K is (K /7) *9, but only if original K was divisible by 7.\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\nif (K %7 ==0) then K = K/7.\n\nThen, regardless, K *=9.\n\nWait, so the K after that is (original K divided by 7 if divisible) multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, but the code's logic is a bit unclear. Let me see:\n\nSuppose K was 7, then after division by 7, it becomes 1, then multiplied by 9 gives 9.\n\nSo the code's K is modified in that way.\n\nThen, the problem is to find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod (new K) is 1 mod (new K).\n\nWait, the remainder starts at 10 mod K (the new K). Then each step multiplies by 10 mod K. So the loop is looking for the smallest ans where (10^ans) mod K ==1.\n\nWait, the initial remainder is 10 mod K. Then each step:\n\nremainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nWe need to find the smallest ans where this equals 1 mod K.\n\nWait, the initial ans is 1, and remainder is 10 mod K. So for ans=1, the remainder is 10 mod K. Then ans increments, and so on until remainder is 1.\n\nWait, the code starts with ans=1, and remainder is 10%K. Then, if that's 1, then ans is 1. Else, loop.\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nwhile (remainder !=1) {\n\nans++;\n\nremainder = (remainder *10) % K;\n\n}\n\nSo the first iteration is ans=1, check if remainder is 1. If not, ans becomes 2, and so on.\n\nWait, the initial ans is 1, and the remainder is 10 mod K. So the first check is whether that remainder is 1. If yes, then ans is 1. Else, loop.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, in C, the steps are:\n\nTake K as val2 (the output from second step).\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 5: if yes, output -1.\n\nElse, check if divisible by 7. If yes, divide by 7.\n\nMultiply by 9 to get new K.\n\nThen compute the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K ==1.\n\nNow, in C, how to handle this?\n\nFirst, check K's divisibility.\n\nThen, process K as per the steps.\n\nNow, putting all together in C:\n\nThe C program must:\n\nRead n and m from stdin.\n\nRead n integers into req array.\n\nRead m integers into pre array.\n\nProcess first algorithm to get val1.\n\nThen process val1 through second algorithm to get val2.\n\nThen process val2 through third algorithm to get final result.\n\nFinally, print the final result.\n\nNow, let's structure the code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read n and m. Then read req and pre arrays.\n\nIn C, since the size is variable, we can read them into arrays of size n and m.\n\nBut in C, we can use dynamic allocation.\n\nWait, but for the first part:\n\nFirst step:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n integers into req array.\n\nThen read m integers into pre array.\n\nSo code:\n\nint n, m;\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\nThen, allocate arrays:\n\nint *req = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n\nint *pre = malloc(m * sizeof(int));\n\nThen read the req elements:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &req[i]);\n\nSimilarly for pre.\n\nThen process the first algorithm.\n\nInitialize i =n-1, j =m-1, ans=0.\n\nLoop while i >=0 and j >=0:\n\nif req[i] > pre[j], ans++, else j--.\n\nThen decrement i each time.\n\nAfter loop, val1 = ans + i +1.\n\nWait, but after the loop, i could be -1 (if the loop ended because i became -1). So val1 is ans + (i) +1.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, val1 is the input to the second step.\n\nSecond step:\n\nTake val1 as n (the input to the second Java program).\n\nCompute the sum.\n\nInitialize ans2 =0.\n\nfor (int i=1; i <= val1; i++) {\n\nlong term = (long)i * ( (val1 /i) * (val1/i +1) ) /2;\n\nans2 += term;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in C, integers can overflow. The second Java program uses long, so in C, we need to use long long to prevent overflow.\n\nWait, the second Java code uses long for ans, so in C, we need to use a 64-bit integer. So in C, we can use long long.\n\nSo:\n\nlong long ans2 =0;\n\nfor (int i=1; i <= val1; i++) {\n\nlong long d = val1 /i;\n\nlong long term = (long long)i * d * (d+1) /2;\n\nans2 += term;\n\n}\n\nThen val2 = ans2.\n\nThird step:\n\nTake val2 as K.\n\nProcess according to third algorithm.\n\nFirst, check if K is even or divisible by 5:\n\nif (K %2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) then the result is -1.\n\nElse, check if divisible by 7:\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nThen multiply by 9: K *=9;\n\nThen compute the minimal ans.\n\nWait, but after that, K could be 0? No, because if K was divisible by 2 or 5, we already returned -1.\n\nWait, but after dividing by 7, K could be 0? No, since K was not divisible by 2 or 5, and if divisible by 7, then K was at least 7, so dividing by 7 gives at least 1.\n\nThen multiply by 9, so K is now 9*(K/7) or 9*K (if not divisible by 7).\n\nNow, compute the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K ==1.\n\nInitialize ans =1, remainder =10 % K.\n\nThen loop while remainder !=1:\n\nans++;\n\nremainder = (remainder *10) % K;\n\nWait, but in C, modulo can be negative, but since remainder is computed as (remainder *10) % K, but K is positive, so the remainder will be between 0 and K-1.\n\nWait, but in C, the % operator can give negative results if the first operand is negative, but here remainder is always positive because we start with 10 mod K (which is between 0 and K-1), and multiply by 10 each time, so remainder is always positive.\n\nSo the loop is safe.\n\nNow, code steps for third part:\n\nint K = val2;\n\nif (K %2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) {\n\n    result = -1;\n\n} else {\n\n    if (K %7 ==0) K /=7;\n\n    K *=9;\n\n    int ans =1;\n\n    int remainder =10 % K;\n\n    while (remainder !=1) {\n\n        ans++;\n\n        remainder = (remainder *10) % K;\n\n    }\n\n    result = ans;\n\n}\n\nWait, but what if K is 1?\n\nThen remainder is 0 mod 1 is 0, but 10 mod 1 is 0. So remainder is 0. Then the loop runs until remainder is 1, but that's impossible. Wait, but if K is 1, then 10 mod 1 is 0, so remainder is 0. The loop condition is while remainder !=1, so it will loop forever?\n\nWait, but in the problem's third Java code, when K is 1, then after processing:\n\nOriginal K is val2 (from second step). Let's see:\n\nSuppose val2 is 1. Then K is 1.\n\nCheck if divisible by 2 or 5: no. Then check if divisible by 7: no. So K remains 1, then multiply by 9: K becomes 9.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the code in the third Java program:\n\nOriginal K is the input (val2). Let's say val2 is 1.\n\nThen, first check: 1%2 is 1, 1%5 is 1, so no. Then check if divisible by 7: no. So K remains 1. Then multiply by 9: K becomes 9.\n\nThen, the remainder is 10 mod 9 =1. So the initial remainder is 1, so the loop doesn't run. So ans is 1. So the result is 1.\n\nWait, so in that case, it's okay.\n\nAnother case: K=7.\n\nOriginal K is 7.\n\nCheck 7%2=1, 7%5=2, so okay. Then since divisible by7, K becomes 1. Multiply by9 gives 9.\n\nThen remainder is 10 mod9 =1. So ans is 1.\n\nAnother case: K=3.\n\nThen K is 3. Not divisible by 2 or5. Not divisible by7. Multiply by9 gives 27.\n\nWe need to find the smallest ans where 10^ans mod27 ==1.\n\nLet's see:\n\n10^1 mod27 is 10.\n\n10^2 mod27 is 100 mod27 = 100-3*27=100-81=19.\n\n10^3 mod27: 10*19=190 mod27. 27*7=189, so 190 mod27 is 1.\n\nSo ans is 3.\n\nSo the code would compute that correctly.\n\nNow, in C, the code for the third part must handle all these cases.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the C code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Read first part's inputs\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    \n    int *req = malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n    int *pre = malloc(m * sizeof(int));\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &req[i]);\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &pre[i]);\n    }\n    \n    // Process first part\n    int i = n-1, j = m-1;\n    int ans1 = 0;\n    while (i >=0 && j >=0) {\n        if (req[i] > pre[j]) {\n            ans1++;\n        } else {\n            j--;\n        }\n        i--;\n    }\n    int val1 = ans1 + i +1;\n    \n    // Process second part\n    long long val2 = 0;\n    for (int i =1; i <= val1; i++) {\n        long long d = val1 / i;\n        val2 += (long long)i * d * (d+1) /2;\n    }\n    \n    // Process third part\n    int K = val2;\n    int result;\n    if (K %2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) {\n        result = -1;\n    } else {\n        if (K %7 ==0) {\n            K /=7;\n        }\n        K *=9;\n        int ans =1;\n        int remainder =10 % K;\n        while (remainder !=1) {\n            ans++;\n            remainder = (remainder *10) % K;\n        }\n        result = ans;\n    }\n    \n    // Output the result\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    \n    free(req);\n    free(pre);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but let me check the first part's calculation again. The val1 is ans1 + i +1. But after the loop, i is the value after the last decrement. Let me see:\n\nSuppose during the loop, i starts at n-1, and each iteration, i is decremented. So after the loop, i is either -1 (if the loop ended because i became -1) or j became -1. So the final i is the value after the last i--.\n\nYes, so the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case for first part:\n\nSuppose n=1, m=1, req[0]=5, pre[0]=3.\n\nThen in the loop:\n\ni starts at 0, j at 0.\n\nreq[0] (5) > pre[0] (3) \u2192 ans1 becomes 1. Then j stays 0, but i is decremented to -1. The loop condition (i >=0) is false, so loop ends.\n\nval1 = 1 + (-1) +1 =1.\n\nSecond part: val1 is 1. The sum is for i from 1 to 1:\n\nd =1/1=1 \u2192 term is 1 *1*(2)/2 =1 \u2192 sum is 1. So val2 is 1.\n\nThird part: K=1. Then:\n\nCheck 1%2 and 1%5 \u2192 no. Then check 1%7 \u2192 no. So K remains 1, multiply by9 \u2192 K=9.\n\nThen remainder is 10 mod9 =1 \u2192 ans is 1. So output is 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nFirst program's code:\n\nSuppose n=3, m=2, req = [3,1,4], pre = [2,5].\n\nProcessing:\n\ni starts at 2 (n-1=2), j=1 (m-1=1).\n\nCompare req[2]=4 vs pre[1]=5 \u2192 4>5? No. So j-- \u2192 j=0.\n\ni becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration: i=1, j=0.\n\nCompare req[1]=1 vs pre[0]=2 \u2192 1>2? No \u2192 j-- \u2192 j=-1. Now loop ends.\n\nans1 is 0 (since only the first iteration didn't increment ans1, and the second didn't either).\n\nval1 = 0 + (1) (since after the loop, i was 1, but after the i-- in the loop, let's see:\n\nWait let me retrace step by step:\n\nInitial i=2, j=1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nCheck req[2] (4) > pre[1] (5)? 4>5 \u2192 no. So j becomes 0.\n\nThen i is decremented to 1.\n\nLoop continues (i=1 >=0, j=0 >=0).\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nreq[1] (1) > pre[0] (2)? 1>2 \u2192 no. So j becomes -1.\n\nThen i is decremented to 0.\n\nNow, loop condition: i=0 >=0, j=-1 <0 \u2192 loop stops.\n\nSo after loop, i is 0 (since after the second iteration's i-- \u2192 1-1=0).\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nWait, in the first iteration:\n\nAfter the if-else, we do i--.\n\nSo first iteration:\n\ni starts at 2.\n\nCheck req[2] (4) vs pre[1] (5). 4>5? No \u2192 j-- to 0.\n\nThen i-- \u2192 2-1=1.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\ni is 1, j is 0.\n\nCheck req[1] (1) vs pre[0] (2). 1>2? No \u2192 j-- to -1.\n\nThen i-- \u2192 1-1=0.\n\nNow, loop condition: i is 0 (>=0), j is -1 \u2192 loop stops.\n\nThus, after loop, i is 0, j is -1.\n\nSo val1 = ans1 (0) + i (0) +1 \u2192 0+0+1=1.\n\nSo val1 is 1.\n\nThen second part's val2 is 1 \u2192 same as before, leading to result 1.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nAnother test case for third part:\n\nSuppose val2 is 7.\n\nThird part:\n\nK=7.\n\nCheck 7%2=1, 7%5=2 \u2192 okay.\n\nCheck divisible by7 \u2192 yes. So K becomes 1. Multiply by9 \u2192 K=9.\n\nThen remainder is 10 mod9=1 \u2192 ans is 1. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case where K=3:\n\nval2=3 \u2192 K=3.\n\nCheck 3%2=1, 3%5=3 \u2192 okay.\n\nNot divisible by7 \u2192 K remains 3. Multiply by9 \u2192 27.\n\nThen find the smallest ans where 10^ans mod27 is 1.\n\nAs before, 10^3 mod27 is 1 \u2192 ans=3.\n\nSo code should return 3.\n\nNow, in the code:\n\nremainder starts as 10 mod27 \u219210.\n\nans starts at 1.\n\nFirst iteration: remainder is 10 !=1 \u2192 ans becomes 2.\n\nremainder = (10*10) mod27 \u2192100 mod27 is 19.\n\nSecond iteration: ans=2, remainder 19 \u2192 not 1 \u2192 ans=3.\n\nremainder =19*10 mod27 \u2192190 mod27 \u2192 190-7*27=190-189=1 \u2192 remainder is 1. So loop stops. ans is 3. Correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, what about K=7* something?\n\nSuppose val2 is 14 (so K=14).\n\nCheck 14%2=0 \u2192 so returns -1.\n\nThus, the code returns -1.\n\nAnother case where K=21 (divisible by 7 and 3).\n\nCheck 21%2=1, 21%5=1 \u2192 okay. 21%7=0 \u2192 divide by7 \u21923. Multiply by9 \u219227.\n\nSame as previous example, so ans is 3.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code in C should handle all these steps.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The first part's arrays: using malloc. Need to make sure that n and m are read correctly. Also, in C, if the input is not properly read, but the code uses scanf, which should handle it as per the input.\n\n- The second part uses long long to prevent overflow. The original Java code uses long, so that's okay.\n\n- The third part's loop could potentially loop forever if no solution exists. But according to the problem's logic, the third Java code's solve function returns -1 in cases where K is even or divisible by5. Otherwise, it must have a solution?\n\nWait, the problem's third Java code's solve function returns -1 only if K is even or divisible by5. Otherwise, it proceeds. But is there a case where even after processing, there is no solution?\n\nSuppose K=3, which is allowed. Then the code works. What about K=9?\n\nWait, K=9 (from val2=9/7? No, let's see:\n\nSuppose val2 is 9. Then K=9.\n\nCheck 9%2=1, 9%5=4 \u2192 okay.\n\nCheck divisible by7? No. So K remains 9, multiply by9 \u219281.\n\nWe need to find the smallest ans where 10^ans mod81 ==1.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n10 mod81 =10.\n\n10^2 mod81 =100 mod81=19.\n\n10^3 mod81 = 190 mod81 \u2192 190-2*81=190-162=28.\n\n10^4 mod81 \u2192280 mod81 \u2192 280-3*81=280-243=37.\n\n10^5 mod81 \u2192370 mod81 \u2192 370-4*81=370-324=46.\n\n10^6 mod81 \u2192460 mod81 \u2192460-5*81=460-405=55.\n\n10^7 mod81 \u2192550 mod81 \u2192550-6*81=550-486=64.\n\n10^8 mod81 \u2192640 mod81 \u2192640-7*81=640-567=73.\n\n10^9 mod81 \u2192730 mod81 \u2192730-9*81=730-729=1.\n\nSo ans is 9.\n\nThus, the code would loop until ans reaches 9.\n\nSo the code would handle that.\n\nAnother case where K=1:\n\nAs before, the code returns 1.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code in C:\n\nI think that's the correct approach. The code reads all inputs, processes each step, and outputs the final result.\n\nI need to make sure that all variables are properly declared and that the loops are correctly implemented.\n\nAlso, in the first part, after processing, the arrays are freed with free(req) and free(pre).\n\nYes, that's handled.\n\nThus, the final C code should be as written above."
